Advertisers buy radio and television airtime where their commercial messages are aired. For mainstream radio and television industries, advertisements are the main source of income that enable them to produce, distribute, and exhibit programs. The average broadcast ad often lasts for 30 seconds; many also run from 10 to 15 seconds but rarely over 30 seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertisers, usually with the services of an advertising agency, prepare commercial messages using a highly developed process in order to ensure that audiences are convinced to utilize their product. The process begins by mining insights from consumers based on their perceived needs and wants to craft marketing and advertising strategies. These insights give way to the development of the product, the product benefit, and the reason that makes this benefit attractive and advantageous to the consumer. At this stage, the ideas generated in the strategies are turned into a radio or television commercial using tactics like emotional appeal and logical reasoning. Most commercials employ both tactics to draw attention to and sell the product to consumers. The Clusivol Vitamin commercials with the tag line &ldquo;Bawal Magkasakit&rdquo; (You Can&rsquo;t Get Sick) incorporate both these tactics. The commercial warns of the difficulty of getting sick in trying and hard times, leading to the loss of income and food for the family, and advises consumption of the product. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a>kid Pre-School 3+&rsquo;s ad strategically identifies the nutrients in the milk, while playing on parental love and concern for their growing children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even with all the extensive groundwork and strategic thinking that go into the crafting of advertising materials, there are commercials that fail to sell the products they promote. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the reasons for such failure is the use of slick, clever or overly amusing executions in which the &ldquo;gimmick&rdquo; overshadows the brand. In these cases, the execution is remembered but not the product or the reason for purchasing it. For instance, the tagline &ldquo;Ibalik ang Swerte&rdquo; (Bring Back the Fortune) became popular when it aired in the 1970s but audiences tended to forget that this was for the campaign of the Philippine National Sweepstakes. Another example is the expression &ldquo;Magpapatuka na lang ako sa ahas&rdquo; (I&rsquo;ll just let a snake bite me), which was made popular by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4936\"><strong>Elizabeth Ramsey</strong></a></strong></strong>. The expression became popular but studies showed that the product that was featured, the detergent bar Superwheel, was hardly remembered by the audience. Another reason advertisements may not work is the clutter of advertisements that fill the airwaves. When the commercial on air does not stand out or capture the audience&rsquo;s attention, the message is lost among the many materials aired on radio and television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The produced commercials are placed in programs that provide the most number of viewers for the cheapest airtime cost. By buying airtime in programs that rate highly and provide the most number of potential consumers of the products, advertisers directly influence the quality and eventually the longevity of a radio or television program. If the program does not rate, no advertising revenues will be expected from this program, therefore leading to the program&rsquo;s reformulation to attract more viewers or its cancellation from the air. This reliance on ratings results in the use of a &ldquo;star system,&rdquo; in which only performers with a large loyal following become the crux of creative work, and the proliferation of formulaic programs that rely on previously high-rating programs. This system does not encourage originality, innovation, and the creation of more imaginative programs on radio and television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertisers and marketers point out several advantages of advertising: giving consumers choices in the products that they will consume; allowing them to select the products or services that best fit their needs; creating competition among businesses often resulting in lower costs and better products and services; fuelling the economy by encouraging the consumption of goods and services; and providing information that creates awareness on topics beneficial for consumers such as the prevention of diseases. On the other hand, advertising, as program content, is criticized because of several issues, the most prominent of which are those concerning &ldquo;truth in advertising,&rdquo; stealth advertising, and the creation of a consumerist society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although advertising is regulated by the Ad Standards Council (ASC), a self-regulating body composed of marketing, advertising, and media organizations in the country which is tasked with crafting and enforcing a code of ethics for advertising and marketing communications, there are questions on &ldquo;truth in advertising.&rdquo; For one, advertising works on highlighting a product&rsquo;s sellable feature. This means that the negative aspects of the product are not presented in broadcast commercials. Advertisers promote the &ldquo;refreshing&rdquo; qualities of soft drinks but do not talk about the health dangers of consuming excessive amounts of sugar. Marketers have created an image that infant milk formulas are superior to breast milk and as such have discounted the inherent benefits of breastfeeding. Couched under the thin line between the truth and creative execution, another example is when pharmaceutical products are presented by performers dressed in doctor&rsquo;s white coats without a nameplate. This leaves the impression that the product is endorsed by the medical community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another issue is <b>stealth advertising</b>. This is the promotion of products and services embedded in non-advertising program content. The range of types of stealth advertising can be characterized as very noticeable to almost subliminal. Brand logos and text crawling on television screens are examples of this type of advertising. Watching a sporting event like basketball exposes viewers to a whole slew of brand logos&mdash;the name of the teams, brand streamers hanging on the courtside, logos beside the team scores, and branding on the court floor. Advertisers will try to maximize exposure of their clients&rsquo; brand logos by putting these in any and every available space on the venue or on the television screen. In advertising parlance, this space where branding can be exposed is called &ldquo;advertising real estate.&rdquo; Another example of stealth advertising is called product placement where a product advertised is incorporated into the set of the program, such as LG television monitors that serve as backdrop to the news programs of <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a></strong></strong>. In various episodes of the drama series <b><i>I Love Betty La Fea</i></b>, premiered September 2008, ABS-CBN, the products Maggi Magic Sarap seasoning, Red Ribbon cakes, Waffle Time, Zagu, Clear anti-dandruff shampoo, and 4G antioxidant food supplement were seen in various episodes. Product placement is not limited to seeing the product visually. When <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4352\"><strong>John Lloyd Cruz</strong></a></strong></strong> says &ldquo;Ingat&rdquo; (Take care) in his appearances on television shows and dramas, this utterance reminds the viewers of Biogesic, the over-the-counter brand of Paracetamol that he endorses. On radio, stealth advertising is sometimes presented in the guise of a newscast. Newscasters begin the program with announcements about the inclement weather and then subtly include a plug for a specific vitamin supplement that is supposed to help the audience prevent catching a cold due to the weather. There are times when the product is integrated into the narrative of the broadcast content. In ABS-CBN&rsquo;s television drama series <b><i>Bituing Walang Ningning</i></b> (Star without Sparkle), 2006, the plot of the final episodes revolved around a showdown concert between the protagonists Dorina and Lavinia, played by <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4000\"><strong>Sarah Geronimo</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> and Angelika Dela Cruz, respectively. Selected scenes from this concert and its rehearsals were used in the final week of the series. Entitled <b><i>Himig ng Pasasalamat </i></b>(Song of Thanksgiving)<i>, </i>this concert was staged on 19 Sep 2006 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a> before a live audience and sponsored by Jollibee, a product endorsed by Sarah Geronimo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Given that the local industry started out as a commercial endeavor, audiences have become used to programs interrupted by commercials. Audiences, during commercial breaks in the regular programming, have the ability to ignore or evaluate the commercial content of broadcast. Stealth advertising, being incorporated in regular programming content, often leaves the audience with no choice but to watch the advertisement. In capturing the audience this way, stealth advertising becomes a strong tool for advertisers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Advertising materials carry ideologies that reinforce and influence the belief system of audiences. Marketing and advertising executives have banked on Filipino consumers&rsquo; desire to have Caucasian features like fairer skin to sell a product. This desire already exists among consumers because historically, especially from the days of colonization, the ideal of being &ldquo;white&rdquo; has been deeply ingrained in the consumer&rsquo;s mind. This belief has been reinforced by celebrating Caucasian features as seen in the choice of models used in Camay commercials since the 1950s. Among the Camay girls were Paquita Roces, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\"><strong>Gloria Romero</strong></a></strong></strong>, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4621\"><strong>Delia Razon</strong></a></strong></strong>, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a></strong></strong>, the Revilla sisters Maritess and Cita, and the daughter of Maritess Revilla, Bianca Araneta&mdash;all of whom are mestizas, defining the concept of Filipina beauty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Embedded in messages of advertising materials are ideas that are &ldquo;naturalized&rdquo; and thereby shape the way audiences think and behave. San Miguel Beer&rsquo;s radio jingle, &ldquo;Tuloy ang Aguinaldo&rdquo; (Carry on with Gift-giving), aired during the economic crisis of 1985, underscores the Filipino&rsquo;s capacity to endure bad times as it espoused &ldquo;Tuloy ang aguinaldo. Tuloy ang simbang gabi. Tuloy ang caroling. Tuloy ang Pasko. Tuloy ang San Miguel Beer.&rdquo; (Carry on with gift-giving. Carry on with midnight mass. Carry on with caroling. Carry on Christmas. Carry on San Miguel Beer.) This radio commercial also implies that San Miguel Beer is part of the Filipino&rsquo;s traditions and way of life that should be upheld even in times of crisis. Another San Miguel Beer commercial, &ldquo;Bilmoko&rdquo; (Buy Me), 1988, naturalizes a gender bias against women. In this television commercial, the lead actor buys his fantasy girlfriend everything that she wants&mdash;jewelry, clothes, food, and San Miguel Beer&mdash;as a sign of his affection. This scenario promotes the idea that men are providers, and women&rsquo;s love can be bought. It also reinforces the concept of women as frivolous and shallow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from these specific values, the overarching ideology that advertising promotes is consumerism. In simple terms, this is the belief system that promotes consumption of goods as a way of life. Consumerism sways audiences to believe that acquiring material goods is needed to improve lives. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1346\"><strong>Advertisement</strong></a>s that herald &ldquo;the best,&rdquo; &ldquo;new,&rdquo; &ldquo;improved,&rdquo; and other similar superlatives are equated with &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; consumers who make better choices to enhance their lives. Advertisers also make products integral to the viewers&rsquo; daily living. McDonald&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hooray for Today,&rdquo; 2012, with the line &ldquo;Hooray for mornings and things that make them good,&rdquo; insinuates that having a good day begins with a coffee and breakfast at McDonald&rsquo;s. Also, commercial messages are sometimes equated with personal and institutional ideals resulting in the belief that these values exist with the products and services. Del Monte Tomato Sauce&rsquo;s television commercial, &ldquo;Come Home to Del Monte,&rdquo; 2012, has the line &ldquo;Once a week, come home to Mom&rsquo;s cooking, come home to Del Monte Tomato Sauce&hellip; Bringing Filipino families closer for generations&hellip; Surely you would be closer&hellip;&rdquo; which equates close family ties with the product. The same value of family togetherness is the message of Jollibee&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Love You Sabado&rdquo; ad, which shows a family eating together on a school holiday. A look at some of the taglines of Coca-Cola in the Philippines demonstrates how Coke is positioned as an integral part of life, well-being, and happiness: &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t Beat the Feeling,&rdquo; 1989; &ldquo;Kasama ka, Coke&rdquo; (You Belong, Coke), 2005; &ldquo;Share a Coke sa Saya,&rdquo; (Share Coke in Happy Times), 2014. <em><strong>Written by Fernando A.

In this television commercial, the lead actor buys his fantasy girlfriend everything that she wants&#x2014;jewelry, clothes, food, and San Miguel Beer&#x2014;as a sign of his affection. This scenario promotes the idea that men are providers, and women&#x2019;s love can be bought. It also reinforces the concept of women as frivolous and shallow."

				"value": "Aside from these specific values, the overarching ideology that advertising promotes is consumerism. In simple terms, this is the belief system that promotes consumption of goods as a way of life. Consumerism sways audiences to believe that acquiring material goods is needed to improve lives. <a href=\"/8/64/1346\"><strong>Advertisement</strong></a>s that herald &#x201C;the best,&#x201D; &#x201C;new,&#x201D; &#x201C;improved,&#x201D; and other similar superlatives are equated with &#x201C;intelligent&#x201D; consumers who make better choices to enhance their lives. Advertisers also make products integral to the viewers&#x2019; daily living. McDonald&#x2019;s &#x201C;Hooray for Today,&#x201D; 2012, with the line &#x201C;Hooray for mornings and things that make them good,&#x201D; insinuates that having a good day begins with a coffee and breakfast at McDonald&#x2019;s. Also, commercial messages are sometimes equated with personal and institutional ideals resulting in the belief that these values exist with the products and services. Del Monte Tomato Sauce&#x2019;s television commercial, &#x201C;Come Home to Del Monte,&#x201D; 2012, has the line &#x201C;Once a week, come home to Mom&#x2019;s cooking, come home to Del Monte Tomato Sauce&#x2026; Bringing Filipino families closer for generations&#x2026; Surely you would be closer&#x2026;&#x201D; which equates close family ties with the product. The same value of family togetherness is the message of Jollibee&#x2019;s &#x201C;I Love You Sabado&#x201D; ad, which shows a family eating together on a school holiday. A look at some of the taglines of Coca-Cola in the Philippines demonstrates how Coke is positioned as an integral part of life, well-being, and happiness: &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t Beat the Feeling,&#x201D; 1989; &#x201C;Kasama ka, Coke&#x201D; (You Belong, Coke), 2005; &#x201C;Share a Coke sa Saya,&#x201D; (Share Coke in Happy Times), 2014. <em><strong>Written by Fernando A.

To illustrate the shift from music programming characterized by stations devoted to specific music genres on FM radio to the AM format of talk was due to the former&rsquo;s poor ratings (Aseron 2011, 154-57).

This humor is illustrated by program titles like <b><i>Tambalang Balasubas at Balahura</i></b> (A Swindler and a Filthy Tandem) and the station&rsquo;s slogan&mdash;&ldquo;Kailangan Pa Bang I-memorize &lsquo;Yan?&rdquo;<i> </i>(Do we need to memorize that?)&mdash;and the aliases of its disc jockeys like Chris Tsuper, Nicole Hyala, and Papa Jack.

		"text": "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Broadcast audiences</b> are defined as the groups of people who are the intended recipients of media content. In understanding broadcast audiences, it is important to look at the power relationship between the medium and its audience. The questions asked are: (1) What power do the media have over audiences?; (2) What is the power of audiences over the media? Media, specifically radio and television, have an impact, effect, and influence on their audiences, but audiences also impact on, affect, and influence broadcast texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Impact refers to the immediate and initial reactions of audiences to broadcast text, which may be in terms of emotions and identification. While listening to or watching a broadcast program, audiences feel emotions which usually correspond to the context of the program text. The way audiences demonstrate their emotions ranges from the physical to the verbal. For example, some audiences have tears welling up in their eyes during dramatic moments or they laugh out loud at comical scenes in a sitcom. In the excitement brought about by the broadcast text, the audience roots for the protagonist of the program and even instructs him or her on how to avoid the antagonist. Often, these emotions are cathartic, giving audiences pleasure and gratification. There are also emotions that are counter-text which give pleasure. For instance, some audiences obtain pleasure in finding faults in the characters they see or enjoy the failure or misery of others, the classic example of which is when audiences laugh at a performer who slips on a banana peel.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pleasure and gratification also come from identification. Audiences identify with the characters, situations, and stories that are presented in a broadcast program. Audiences find themselves sharing the same identity and experience of the characters in the text. They may also know somebody with the same characteristics. This allows the audience to sympathize with the character. Some begin to feel like the leading character in a drama because of shared trials. Identification can also be aspirational, where audiences wish and hope to become the character they listen to or watch, or to be situated in the context of the program. For example, while watching a game show, audiences want to experience winning the million-peso prize, and therefore root for the contestant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pleasure is the product of satisfying expectations from the broadcast program. It is in this pleasure that the media has power over its audiences. When audiences are emotionally hooked on a program or when they identify and share the trials and triumphs of media characters and personalities, audiences tend to patronize and continuously support the media product from where they derive pleasure and gratification. This leads to building viewership and developing higher ratings which are the goals of commercial broadcast. This partly explains the popular reception by audiences of long-running programs like the soaps <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fate), 1949-56, DZRH, and 1977-85, BBC 2, <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, 1979-84, RPN 9, and <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b>, 1980-85, GMA; the anthologies in which letter senders&rsquo; life are featured, such as <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Only Yesterday), 1976-86, and <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b>, 1980-96, both on GMA, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a></i></b> (Will You Remember), 1991 and still running, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a></strong></strong>; the comedy <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), 1973-90, RPN 9; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!), beginning in 1979 on RPN 9 until its present run on GMA, especially its 2015 monstrous hit, the AlDub phenomenon in the segment &ldquo;Kalyeserye&rdquo; (Street Series). Aldub stands for the split-screen love team of young star Alden Richards and dubsmash sensation Maine Mendoza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Identification may lead to modeling. Although modeling does not directly benefit broadcast institutions, imitating the identity and behavior of the idols which audiences create and look up to speaks of the influence that media has on society and its values. Also, this predilection of commercial broadcast industries for providing pleasures and gratifications has been criticized as creating an escapist society where audiences run away from the realities of life instead of taking action to improve their conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The beginnings of media research focused on the effects of media on audiences. Given that the context of this research is the scientific paradigm, early media researchers looked for direct effects of media on audiences, where media is the cause and audience behavior is the effect. Early assumptions using this paradigm gave rise to the &ldquo;magic bullet theory&rdquo; or the &ldquo;hypodermic needle model&rdquo; of media. This assumption suggests that the intended media messages are directly received and believed by audiences leading to direct response or behavioral changes. A common example of this model is the relationship between broadcast programs and social norms. For instance, the model indicates that exposure to crime and violence leads audiences to a similar lifestyle. Or exposure to a political advertisement prompts audiences to vote for the candidate promoted in the advertisement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More empirical studies, however, negated the powerful effects of media. Through more scientific research, the &ldquo;two-step flow model&rdquo; of communication was developed. This model points to the intervention of an opinion leader before audiences directly accept a media message. In political campaigns, audiences are inclined to seek out opinion leaders or persons whose views they trust before deciding on which candidate to vote. Even in terms of lifestyle, audiences tend to seek insights from opinion leaders before buying clothes, appliances, and the like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later studies have weakened the cause-and-effect models of the power of media on audiences. For example, the agenda-setting theory argues that media does not have direct power to change audience opinion. Instead, media just has the power to set the issues that are in the minds of audiences. Even in marketing, media messages are not expected to directly affect buying behavior. Other selling strategies that do not necessarily employ the media are now used to sell products like direct marketing, guerrilla marketing, events, activation, public relations, and similar approaches. What is clear is the power of media to provide audiences with information. For example, announcements of suspension of classes and work due to impending typhoons directly lead to an audience response: students do not go to their schools and workers do not go to their offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The shift from the scientific to the cultural-critical paradigms of research moves away from fully accepting the direct outcomes of the media audience effects models. In the cultural-critical paradigm, the power of media lies in its role to contribute to other factors that influence audiences. These other factors include institutions and social structures like the church, government, and the family. Even individual persons or peer groups contribute to influence an audience&rsquo;s beliefs and behavior. Given this point of view, media is only one among these institutions that play a vital and important role in reinforcing and altering beliefs and prompting or changing behavior. The audience&rsquo;s meaning structures, cultural and social influences, and their capacity to evaluate and make choices greatly weaken the capacity of media&rsquo;s direct effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Media can reinforce audiences&rsquo; lifestyles, view of the world, and ideologies. For instance, wearing the latest trends in fashion is a lifestyle-changing decision that is made by audiences because of their aspiration to be like their idols as well as what they see in stores and the opinions of their friends. Audiences may have a preconceived view of Paris as the city of love based on what other people say and not from their actual experience. Watching the <b>Koreanovela</b> <b><i>Lovers in Paris</i></b>, 2003, ABS-CBN, brings this notion to life, reinforcing an imagining of Paris as a place for romance. The belief that women are the &ldquo;weaker sex&rdquo; or that homosexuals are &ldquo;sex-crazed&rdquo; may have been learned from the family and the church, but media can make these beliefs seem natural or God-given through the stereotyping of these genders on broadcast programs. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> may become environment-friendly and limit one&rsquo;s carbon footprints as a result of environmental campaigns aired on radio and television, as well as efforts initiated by civil society groups, the government, and schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Audiences, on the other hand, also inform broadcast texts. The power of the audience comes from being an active audience, which comes in a variety of conceptions. This power allows the audience to impose norms or standards that they expect from media, alter broadcast programming, resist meanings intended by the producers of the show, create programs as alternative to mainstream media, and apply new meanings in media and text in their daily lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Giving feedback is an audience activity that pre-dates the actual conception of the active audience. Feedback reaches broadcast institutions in a variety of ways&ndash;from audiences directly writing to stations or through the social media to formal research results. The power of feedback through a concerted effort of audiences, advertising stakeholders, and other institutions was seen in the case of an episode of <b><i>Willing Willie</i></b>, aired on TV5 on 12 Mar 2011, in which host Willie Revillame prodded a six-year-old boy to gyrate to sexually provocative music like a &ldquo;macho dancer&rdquo; in his variety show. The intense response by the public forced TV5 to suspend Revillame and has resulted in sanctions against the program and the imposition of new norms or standards in the treatment of children in media, particularly the amendment to Article 17 (Quiz Shows, Contests, Public Participation Programs, and Promotions) of the Broadcast Code of the <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)</strong></a></strong></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The active audience, according to the uses and gratification theory, selects media and programs that provide them with satisfaction based on their socio-cultural and psychological wants and needs.

				"value": "<b>Broadcast audiences</b> are defined as the groups of people who are the intended recipients of media content. In understanding broadcast audiences, it is important to look at the power relationship between the medium and its audience. The questions asked are: (1) What power do the media have over audiences?; (2) What is the power of audiences over the media? Media, specifically radio and television, have an impact, effect, and influence on their audiences, but audiences also impact on, affect, and influence broadcast texts."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Impact refers to the immediate and initial reactions of audiences to broadcast text, which may be in terms of emotions and identification. While listening to or watching a broadcast program, audiences feel emotions which usually correspond to the context of the program text. The way audiences demonstrate their emotions ranges from the physical to the verbal. For example, some audiences have tears welling up in their eyes during dramatic moments or they laugh out loud at comical scenes in a sitcom. In the excitement brought about by the broadcast text, the audience roots for the protagonist of the program and even instructs him or her on how to avoid the antagonist. Often, these emotions are cathartic, giving audiences pleasure and gratification. There are also emotions that are counter-text which give pleasure. For instance, some audiences obtain pleasure in finding faults in the characters they see or enjoy the failure or misery of others, the classic example of which is when audiences laugh at a performer who slips on a banana peel."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Pleasure and gratification also come from identification. Audiences identify with the characters, situations, and stories that are presented in a broadcast program. Audiences find themselves sharing the same identity and experience of the characters in the text. They may also know somebody with the same characteristics. This allows the audience to sympathize with the character. Some begin to feel like the leading character in a drama because of shared trials. Identification can also be aspirational, where audiences wish and hope to become the character they listen to or watch, or to be situated in the context of the program. For example, while watching a game show, audiences want to experience winning the million-peso prize, and therefore root for the contestant."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Pleasure is the product of satisfying expectations from the broadcast program. It is in this pleasure that the media has power over its audiences. When audiences are emotionally hooked on a program or when they identify and share the trials and triumphs of media characters and personalities, audiences tend to patronize and continuously support the media product from where they derive pleasure and gratification. This leads to building viewership and developing higher ratings which are the goals of commercial broadcast. This partly explains the popular reception by audiences of long-running programs like the soaps <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fate), 1949-56, DZRH, and 1977-85, BBC 2, <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, 1979-84, RPN 9, and <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b>, 1980-85, GMA; the anthologies in which letter senders&#x2019; life are featured, such as <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Only Yesterday), 1976-86, and <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b>, 1980-96, both on GMA, and <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a></i></b> (Will You Remember), 1991 and still running, <strong><strong><a href=\"/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a></strong></strong>; the comedy <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), 1973-90, RPN 9; and <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!), beginning in 1979 on RPN 9 until its present run on GMA, especially its 2015 monstrous hit, the AlDub phenomenon in the segment &#x201C;Kalyeserye&#x201D; (Street Series). Aldub stands for the split-screen love team of young star Alden Richards and dubsmash sensation Maine Mendoza."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Identification may lead to modeling. Although modeling does not directly benefit broadcast institutions, imitating the identity and behavior of the idols which audiences create and look up to speaks of the influence that media has on society and its values. Also, this predilection of commercial broadcast industries for providing pleasures and gratifications has been criticized as creating an escapist society where audiences run away from the realities of life instead of taking action to improve their conditions."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The beginnings of media research focused on the effects of media on audiences. Given that the context of this research is the scientific paradigm, early media researchers looked for direct effects of media on audiences, where media is the cause and audience behavior is the effect. Early assumptions using this paradigm gave rise to the &#x201C;magic bullet theory&#x201D; or the &#x201C;hypodermic needle model&#x201D; of media. This assumption suggests that the intended media messages are directly received and believed by audiences leading to direct response or behavioral changes. A common example of this model is the relationship between broadcast programs and social norms. For instance, the model indicates that exposure to crime and violence leads audiences to a similar lifestyle. Or exposure to a political advertisement prompts audiences to vote for the candidate promoted in the advertisement."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "More empirical studies, however, negated the powerful effects of media. Through more scientific research, the &#x201C;two-step flow model&#x201D; of communication was developed. This model points to the intervention of an opinion leader before audiences directly accept a media message. In political campaigns, audiences are inclined to seek out opinion leaders or persons whose views they trust before deciding on which candidate to vote. Even in terms of lifestyle, audiences tend to seek insights from opinion leaders before buying clothes, appliances, and the like."

It is an advocacy organization that promotes TV literacy and pushes for child-sensitive and family-friendly television programs in the Philippines. It started giving out the Anak TV Seal Awards in 2000. Programs are judged based on moral slant, artistic merit, educational content, and cultural relevance. The screening process is multitiered and done in different regions of the country. The jury, numbering about 2000, is composed of representatives from different sectors who are also considered stakeholders of TV programming: parents, educators, business and media people, government, nongovernment organizations, the religious sector, psychologists, mass media and literary scholars, and the youth (<b><i>Manila Standard</i></b> 2002; <b><i>Adobo Magazine</i></b> 2011; Anak TV Web 2015).

Calling itself the Entertainment Press Society, this new group of entertainment writers from the print medium created the Golden Screen TV Awards, also in the same year (kikayjack 2004). For its first seven years, it gave recognition to 29 categories of entertainment shows and personalities only (Lo 2004). In 2011, it included recognitions for news programs and anchors. It now has 50 awards for different categories of television programs and artists. The highest honor, called the Helen Vela Lifetime Achievement Award, named after radio drama announcer and TV host Helen Vela, is given to distinguished achievements of personalities in drama, comedy, and news program. The first recipients of the Helen Vela Lifetime Achievement Award were Nora Aunor for drama, Harry Gasser for news broadcasting, and Joey de Leon for comedy (Lo 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Annual student awards for works in radio and television broadcast sprung up like mushrooms in the mid-2000s, beginning with the University of Santos Tomas USTV Students Choice Awards, 2005.

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Blocktime</b> is measured airtime, handled or considered as a single unit. <b>Blocktiming</b> is the network practice of selling airtime to individuals or groups. A <b>blocktimer</b> is an individual or group that broadcasts programs over radio or television through airtime bought from broadcast networks. The blocktimer may be a journalist, an artist, a politician, a business group, a church organization, or any interest group. The blocktimer may sell advertising spots to sponsors in order to gain profit. Blocktimers play a significant social, economic, political, and cultural role in Philippine broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio stations in the early 1930s earned revenues without the trouble of producing radio programs through blocktiming. Radio companies partitioned their airtime into 15-minute blocks which were opened up to interested buyers or blocktimers. Successful blocktimers then were performers or artists from the <i>bodabil </i>(vaudeville)<i> </i>or the <i>komedya</i> who knew the taste of the listening public. However, artistic talent must be combined with business acumen to succeed in blocktiming. Those who flourished in the early years had the flair to produce radio shows and to sell advertising spots to small enterprises. Such was the story of Ubaldo Andres, aka Conde Ubaldo, a moniker from his role in the komedya. Andres bought many 15-minute blocks of airtime in three radio stations that broadcast the variety programs he created. He also wrote, performed, and produced the ad spots of his clients who wanted to promote their products and services over radio. In contrast to big American multinational companies that sponsored network programs, his clients included a family-owned restaurant, a hardware, a local cosmetic brand, and a transport company. Another successful blocktimer in the 1930s was the couple <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4987\"><strong>Alejandro Villegas</strong></a></strong></strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a> Fernando, more popularly known as Andoy Balun-balunan and Dely Atay-atayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Blocktiming was the lifeblood of early Philippine television when networks did not produce their own TV programs but were mere keepers of airtime. Earnings came from advertising companies that sponsored specific time slots to air programs that fit the endorsement of their products. From the 1950s to the 1960s, such programs ran on Bolinao Electronics Corporation, later to become Alto Broadcasting Corporation (ABS) Channel 3. Examples were the drama program <em><b>Flordeluna </b></em>and the variety show<em><b> Mahiwagang Kahon </b></em><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Magic Box). Under ABS were game shows and variety programs like </span></em><em><b>Pistang Caltex </b></em><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Caltex Fiesta),</span></em><em> </em><em><b>Unahan sa Kampana </b></em><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Rush to the Bell),</span></em><em> </em><em><b>Kualta Na </b></em><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Money Now), </span></em><em><b>Vi-Milk Party</b></em><em>, </em><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">and </span></em><em><b>Your Show of Shows</b></em>. In the 1960s, income from blocktiming supported the early years of Republic Broadcasting System Channel 7. Its owner, Robert &ldquo;Uncle Bob&rdquo; Stewart, diligently approached small businessmen and modest companies, persuading them to buy blocktime with affordable advertising packages. Thus, it was a common practice for Stewart to cheerfully endorse various products and services in the children&rsquo;s show <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky Seven Club.</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Blocktimers during the martial law period were regulated by the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP), a body established by the government&rsquo;s Department of Public Information. Successful blocktimers then were businessmen or individuals who had connections with the government. Blocktimers produced variety shows, drama anthologies, sitcoms, and sports programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1979, Television and Production Exponents, Inc, headed by Tony Tuviera, with the aid of politician Romy Jalosjos, produced the longest running noontime show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a> </i>(</b>Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!) on Kanlaon Broadcasting Station (KBS) Channel 9. Broadcast executive Salvador &ldquo;Buddy&rdquo; Tan also became a blocktimer after he resigned as general manager of KBS. He brought in foreign programs from the US and Japan like <b><i>Twilight Zone</i></b>, <b><i>Voltron</i></b>, <b><i>Moonlighting</i></b>, <b><i>Transformers</i></b>, <b><i>G.I. Joe</i></b>, <b><i>Six Million Dollar Man</i></b>, <b><i>Wonder Woman</i></b>, and <b><i>Takeshi&rsquo;s Castle</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, blocktimers produced progressive talk shows and magazine programs that tackled political, social, and economic issues. Examples of such shows were <b><i>Probe</i></b>, hosted by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4879\"><strong>Cheche Lazaro</strong></a></strong></strong> and produced by her group, The Probe Team; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1451\"><strong>Isip Pinoy</strong></a> </i></b>(Filipino Psyche), hosted by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\"><strong>Charo Santos</strong></a></strong></strong> and Vic Sumulong, and produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/921\"><strong>Lahing Kayumanggi</strong></a> Productions; and <b><i>Womanwatch</i></b>, hosted by Nikki Coseteng and produced by the Women&rsquo;s Media Circle. There was the revival of pre-martial law shows like the drama program <b><i>Balintataw </i></b>(The Mind&rsquo;s Eye) and the airing of the socially oriented drama anthology <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a> ng PETA </i></b>(Offering of PETA) produced by the Philippine Educational Theater Association. On radio, the Citizens&rsquo; Alliance for Consumer Protection produced the weekly drama <b><i>Pintig ng Konsyumer</i></b> (Consumer Pulse) aired on DWXI-AM; the Philippine Peasant Institute produced the weekly talk-drama program <b><i>Punlaan sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1179\"><strong>Himpapawid</strong></a> </i></b>(Planting Seeds on Air) aired on DWAN-AM; the Tambuyog Development Center produced the daily talk program <b><i>Radyo Lundayan </i></b>(Lundayan Radio) aired on DZEC-AM, with Saturdays devoted to the radio adaptation of stories about issues of fishers, the environment, and other social issues written by noted and emerging writers; and the Pan-Philippine News and Information Network and Pathways Productions produced the daily drama program <b><i>Pitlag! Kuwento ng Buhay, Isyu ng Bayan</i></b> (Jolt! <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a> of Life, Issues of the Nation), with a forum segment during Saturdays, aired on Radio Veritas, then on RMN radio stations nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1990s, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a></strong></strong>, as the leading television network, started to consolidate capital by luring big advertisers to support station-produced programs on primetime TV slots. This move pushed blocktimers to early morning or late evening time slots. Programs on prime time were required to be station produced. The policy compelled ABS-CBN blocktimer <b><i>Eat Bulaga! </i></b>to move to GMA Network in 1995. <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> remained with GMA Network in the 2010s but the relationship is impermanent because TAPE Inc had to periodically sign blocktiming contracts with GMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most blocktimers at the time bought airtime in sequestered stations, such as RPN Channel 9 and IBC Channel 13, or in the newly revived Associated Broadcasting Corporation Channel 5. But small TV entrepreneurs were forced to terminate their shows because of the shrinking advertising budget. The wider national and international reach of leading television networks like ABS-CBN and GMA Network attracted the support of big advertisers. In 2001, 66 percent of the 27 billion pesos spent by the ad agency Campaigns and Grey went to television, eight percent went to radio, and 16 percent to print. As advertising budget continued to shrink in the succeeding years, the big players got the biggest share while small media organizations suffered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even print media resort to blocktiming as a cost-effective way of expanding its reach. By the 2000s, the highly circulated <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b> (PDI) found itself on a crossroad, confronted by the TV medium&rsquo;s popularity and the advent of online media. In response to this challenge, the PDI was relaunched as a multimedia organization backed up by a wide news-gathering network and reliable editorial support. In 2010, PDI created its online news and inaugurated Radyo Inquirer (Inquirer Radio) by purchasing the blocktime of DWRT-AM 990 kHz. Initially called DZIQ Radyo, it changed its name to Inquirer Radio 990 AM in 2013. The radio station has worldwide reach through live audio webcast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through blocktiming, a church group may effectively position itself in the media landscape. <b><i>Ang Dating Daan</i></b> (The Former Path) hosted by Eliseo Soriano started as a religious radio program in 1980 on DWWA.

Radio companies partitioned their airtime into 15-minute blocks which were opened up to interested buyers or blocktimers. Successful blocktimers then were performers or artists from the <i>bodabil </i>(vaudeville)<i> </i>or the <i>komedya</i> who knew the taste of the listening public. However, artistic talent must be combined with business acumen to succeed in blocktiming. Those who flourished in the early years had the flair to produce radio shows and to sell advertising spots to small enterprises. Such was the story of Ubaldo Andres, aka Conde Ubaldo, a moniker from his role in the komedya. Andres bought many 15-minute blocks of airtime in three radio stations that broadcast the variety programs he created. He also wrote, performed, and produced the ad spots of his clients who wanted to promote their products and services over radio. In contrast to big American multinational companies that sponsored network programs, his clients included a family-owned restaurant, a hardware, a local cosmetic brand, and a transport company. Another successful blocktimer in the 1930s was the couple <strong><strong><a href=\"/8/69/4987\"><strong>Alejandro Villegas</strong></a></strong></strong> and <a href=\"/4/24/1098\"><strong>Adela</strong></a> Fernando, more popularly known as Andoy Balun-balunan and Dely Atay-atayan."

Examples were the drama program <em><b>Flordeluna </b></em>and the variety show<em><b> Mahiwagang Kahon </b></em><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Magic Box).

It may be done by a number of persons or groups, including the government, mass media, or the author in the case of self-censorship. Government usually censors programs that contain messages that are deemed to be a serious threat to the existing political, social, or moral order. The government&rsquo;s act of censorship against the media, or any form of expression, before actual publication or dissemination to the public, is called &ldquo;prior restraint.&rdquo; Mass media organizations may regulate the media products of their members to make sure that they follow standards of professionalism and rules collectively established for the common welfare of broadcast professionals. Lastly, radio and television producers, directors, marketers, and other managers may decide to edit their programs and products to avoid censorship or to get a more general rating for their shows. In this essay, only the first type of censorship will be discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcasting in the country, as well as all media, has experienced two distinct periods of censorship: Japanese Occupation during World War II and martial law. During the war, the Japanese took over all media to disseminate propaganda as well as to restrict the flow of information. Radio was particularly guarded as broadcast signals were deemed deadlier than bullets. [See R<b>adio Broadcasting in the Philippines (1941-45)</b>.] During the martial law years, the Marcos government closed or took over privately-owned newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, and other forms of media communications. Several prominent journalists across all mass media platforms were imprisoned on the basis of the perceived &ldquo;aid and comfort&rdquo; they gave political opponents. [See <b>Radio and Television Broadcasting in the Philippines (1972-86)</b>.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The closure and control of all forms of mass media, including broadcast, effectively denied to journalists and broadcasters the right to free speech, expression, and the press. The chilling effect on the remaining media workers in the field severely hampered the production of media content because of the power of the Secretary of Public Information to screen and clear publications and broadcasts prior to public dissemination. The Bureau of Standards for Mass Media was created, which required media organizations to obtain a certificate of authorization prior to their operations from the Bureau chiefs: the Press Secretary and the Secretary of National Defense. As a result, broadcasters made sure that no programs were produced that could offend, insult, or otherwise raise the ire of the government. They were crippled in the exercise of their profession and were unable to truly contribute to the advancement of truth, arts, morals, education, and a responsible government. Gone were programs that made it a point to nudge or shame the government towards doing what is right and best for its constituency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos&rsquo;s ouster in 1986 restored the freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press, which are protected by the Constitution. However, such protection does not extend to certain classes of speech and expression, including those considered defamatory, obscene, constituting a clear and present danger to the government, or a threat of imminent lawless action. The libel and slander laws allow the government to legally punish someone who utters defamatory speech. Similarly, obscene speech and expression, defined as the use of vulgar terms without any literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, are not protected because of their offensive and sexual nature. Speech and expression deemed to constitute a clear and present danger to the government, or pose as a threat leading to imminent lawless action, can be restricted or punished by virtue of the state&rsquo;s right to self-preservation and protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even if speech and expression were protected by the Constitution, the broadcast medium enjoys a lesser scope of protection compared to other forms of mass media. For example, the government may not give much attention to a certain literary article printed in a newspaper, but the same article, if broadcast through the airwaves, may be deemed powerful enough to incite rebellion and cause unrest. Also, the government may view as permissible an exercise of expression in a film to a certain segment of the audience, while also declaring it to be unfit for broadcast. The stricter standard for broadcast is due to its nature as a medium. Radio and television have a pervasive presence in the public&rsquo;s lives, with a radio or television set found in every household as well as business establishments, public transportation, and other places of public utility and enjoyment. It is easy to receive broadcast signals, intentionally or not, unlike newspapers that have to be bought and read or a film for which one has to line up for a ticket and sit through the film.

For television, there are four classifications: G for &ldquo;General Patronage,&rdquo; when the MTRCB deems that the material does not contain anything unsuitable for children; PG for &ldquo;Parental Guidance,&rdquo; when the MTRCB finds that the program may contain adult material that may be permissible for children to watch under adult supervision; SPG for &ldquo;Strict Parental Guidance,&rdquo; for programs that the MTRCB considers unsuitable for children unless more vigilant parental supervision is present; and X for &ldquo;Disapproved for Airing on Television,&rdquo; for programs that the MTRCB regards as immoral, indecent, contrary to law and/or good customs, injurious to the prestige of the Philippines or its people, or with a tendency to encourage violence and the commission of a crime (MTRCB 2004). An example of a program given the X classification due to what the MTRCB judged as a sensitive rape scene is the episode &ldquo;Manika&rdquo; (Doll) in <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a></strong></strong>&rsquo;s drama anthology <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a></i></b> (Will You Remember) in Jun 2012.

It may be done by a number of persons or groups, including the government, mass media, or the author in the case of self-censorship. Government usually censors programs that contain messages that are deemed to be a serious threat to the existing political, social, or moral order. The government&#x2019;s act of censorship against the media, or any form of expression, before actual publication or dissemination to the public, is called &#x201C;prior restraint.&#x201D; Mass media organizations may regulate the media products of their members to make sure that they follow standards of professionalism and rules collectively established for the common welfare of broadcast professionals. Lastly, radio and television producers, directors, marketers, and other managers may decide to edit their programs and products to avoid censorship or to get a more general rating for their shows. In this essay, only the first type of censorship will be discussed."

During the war, the Japanese took over all media to disseminate propaganda as well as to restrict the flow of information. Radio was particularly guarded as broadcast signals were deemed deadlier than bullets. [See R<b>adio Broadcasting in the Philippines (1941-45)</b>.] During the martial law years, the Marcos government closed or took over privately-owned newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, and other forms of media communications. Several prominent journalists across all mass media platforms were imprisoned on the basis of the perceived &#x201C;aid and comfort&#x201D; they gave political opponents.

				"value": "The closure and control of all forms of mass media, including broadcast, effectively denied to journalists and broadcasters the right to free speech, expression, and the press. The chilling effect on the remaining media workers in the field severely hampered the production of media content because of the power of the Secretary of Public Information to screen and clear publications and broadcasts prior to public dissemination. The Bureau of Standards for Mass Media was created, which required media organizations to obtain a certificate of authorization prior to their operations from the Bureau chiefs: the Press Secretary and the Secretary of National Defense. As a result, broadcasters made sure that no programs were produced that could offend, insult, or otherwise raise the ire of the government. They were crippled in the exercise of their profession and were unable to truly contribute to the advancement of truth, arts, morals, education, and a responsible government. Gone were programs that made it a point to nudge or shame the government towards doing what is right and best for its constituency."

				"value": "Marcos&#x2019;s ouster in 1986 restored the freedom of speech, of expression, and of the press, which are protected by the Constitution. However, such protection does not extend to certain classes of speech and expression, including those considered defamatory, obscene, constituting a clear and present danger to the government, or a threat of imminent lawless action. The libel and slander laws allow the government to legally punish someone who utters defamatory speech. Similarly, obscene speech and expression, defined as the use of vulgar terms without any literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, are not protected because of their offensive and sexual nature. Speech and expression deemed to constitute a clear and present danger to the government, or pose as a threat leading to imminent lawless action, can be restricted or punished by virtue of the state&#x2019;s right to self-preservation and protection."

				"value": "Even if speech and expression were protected by the Constitution, the broadcast medium enjoys a lesser scope of protection compared to other forms of mass media. For example, the government may not give much attention to a certain literary article printed in a newspaper, but the same article, if broadcast through the airwaves, may be deemed powerful enough to incite rebellion and cause unrest. Also, the government may view as permissible an exercise of expression in a film to a certain segment of the audience, while also declaring it to be unfit for broadcast. The stricter standard for broadcast is due to its nature as a medium. Radio and television have a pervasive presence in the public&#x2019;s lives, with a radio or television set found in every household as well as business establishments, public transportation, and other places of public utility and enjoyment. It is easy to receive broadcast signals, intentionally or not, unlike newspapers that have to be bought and read or a film for which one has to line up for a ticket and sit through the film. The power of broadcast trumps those of other media forms when it comes to disseminating information to a large audience almost instantaneously. Moreover, broadcast producers are reminded that children, whose innocence the law protects, have easy access to radio and television."

Mainly in English and some in Filipino, these articles were published in the 1950s to the 1960s in <b><i>Kislap</i></b>, <b><i>Tagumpay</i></b>, <b><i>The Philippines Herald, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>The Manila Chronicle</i></b>, <b><i>The Chronicle Magazine</i></b>, <b><i>The Manila Times</i></b>, and <b><i>Pitak ng mga Artista sa Pelikula, Radyo, Tanghalan at Telebisyon </i></b>(Features of Artists in Cinema, Radio, Stage and Television). <b><i>Pilipino Magazine</i></b> featured the lives of radio and television artists in a series that ran from 1969 until martial law was declared in 1972. An annual assessment of the industry was a regular feature in <b><i>The Fookien Times</i></b> from the 1960s until the 1990s. During the martial law period, reviews of broadcast programs and issues appeared in several issues of the <b><i>Philippine Daily Express</i></b>, <b><i>Weekend</i></b>, <b><i>Expressweek</i></b>, and <b><i>Who Magazine</i></b>. This type of writings would be the main character of broadcast criticism in the form of articles in magazines and dailies during the early years of the post-EDSA revolt period and on through the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Exceptional works of this type of writings appeared in regular columns of writers in these periodicals. In the late 1960s, Edmund Sicam&rsquo;s column, &ldquo;On Radio,&rdquo; and that of Nestor Torre Jr, &ldquo;On Television,&rdquo; both in <b><i>The Manila Chronicle</i></b>, provided critical analyses of broadcast programs and in-depth assessment of the industry. Torre&rsquo;s sharp-witted observations of blunders by television personalities would see print in his regular column &ldquo;Boob-Tube Booboos,&rdquo; which first appeared in <b><i>The Philippine Daily Express</i></b> in the 1970s and now occasionally appears in the <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>, where he also regularly releases reviews of television shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first to have taken a serious look at broadcasting as popular culture are literary and film critics in essays that form part of their anthologies of criticisms. Clodualdo del Mundo Sr, in &ldquo;Ang Radio: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a>an o Propaganda?&rdquo; (Radio: Entertainment or Propaganda?) in his book <b><i>Mula sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/239\"><strong>Parola</strong></a>ng Ginto </i></b>(From the Golden Lighthouse), 1969, appraises radio programs, in general, as lacking the merits to be considered art forms. Bienvendio Lumbera, in brief notes about radio in the essay &ldquo;Popular Culture as Politics&rdquo; that first appeared in the first issue of <b><i>International Popular Culture</i></b>, 1980, and later in <b><i>Revaluation: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\"><strong>Essay</strong></a>s on Philippine Literature, Cinema and Popular Culture</i></b>, 1984, and selected critical reviews of television programs in his collection of essays on culture and Philippine society, <b><i>Abot-Tanaw: Sulyap at Suri sa Nagbabagong Kultura at Lipunan </i></b>(Within Reach: Glimpse and Analysis of Changing Culture and Society), 1987, call attention to radio soaps, television comedies, and music programming on radio as cultural forms packaged primarily for colonial rule by administrators and profit making by businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among magazines that came out during the martial law period, <b><i>Sagisag </i></b>(Emblem), 1975-79, under the editorship of Lumbera, best exemplifies the significant turn in the appraisal of broadcasting through the prism of cultural studies. While still only a handful compared to film reviews, ground-breaking essays that scrutinized the form and narrative of television drama soaps, variety shows, and advertisements were &ldquo;Mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>angka sa Patalastas sa Telebisyon&rdquo; (Magic in Television <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1346\"><strong>Advertisement</strong></a>s), 1976, and &ldquo;Bentanilyang Kikisap-kisap, Buhay na Aandap-andap: Mga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\"><strong>Luha</strong></a> at Pag-ibig sa Dulang Pantelebisyon&rdquo; (Flickering Lamp, Wavering Life: Tears and Love in Television <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong>), 1979, both by Valerio Nofuente; &ldquo;Ambrosia ng mga Superstars&rdquo; (Ambrosia of the superstars) and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>Sarsuwela</strong></a> sa Tanghalang De-Kahon&rdquo; (Sarsuwela on Theater in the Box), both in 1975 by Victor Abelardo aka Virgilio Almario; and &ldquo;Dilim at Liwanag ng Dulang Pantelebisyon&rdquo; (Darkness and Illumination in Television Drama), 1976, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4952\"><strong>Marcial Sanson</strong></a>. Essays about the artistic valuation of broadcast works under this tradition remain scattered and can be found in occasional reviews in selected magazines and books beginning in the 1980s. Fundador Soriano lamented the state of radio drama writing, particularly its lack of literary qualities in the tradition of the classics, in &ldquo;Naghihingalo nga ba ang mga radio dramas?&rdquo;(Are radio dramas dying?), <b><i>Artista Magazine</i></b>, 1981. Nofuente wrote &ldquo;Portrayals of Life and Reality in Radio and Television Drama&rdquo; that appeared in <b><i>Philippine World-view</i></b>, 1986, edited by Virgilio G. Enriquez. <b><i>Midweek Magazine</i></b>, edited by Pete Lacaba, 1985-91, had regular columns by critics Patrick <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>, Mike Feria, Juaniyo Arcellana, Luis Teodoro, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5436\"><strong>Marra PL. Lanot</strong></a> who, on top of their opinion pieces that reflect their keen observation of several cultural issues during the Aquino administration, produced incisive analyses of television programs and practices in the broadcast industry. Flores collected his reviews of broadcast programs, together with film reviews, in his book<i> <b>Sites of Review: Critical Practice in Media</b></i>, 1996. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5517\"><strong>Resil B.

Diverging from the formalist analysis of media texts, a new set of writings began to shed light on the political economy of Philippine broadcasting, its global networks, owners&rsquo; interlocking interests in transnational corporations, and infrastructures that integrated the nation into the globalized world system. Highly influenced by the world systems theory of Immanuel Wallerstein and Marxist theories of cultural imperialism, pioneering works and essays that employed this approach in the study of broadcasting in the Philippines include Gerald Sussman&rsquo;s <b><i>Telecommunications Transfers: Transnational Corporations, the Philippines and Structures of Domination</i></b>, 1981, and &ldquo;The World Bank and Philippines Telecommunications&rdquo; that appeared in a 1987 issue of the journal <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>; Orlando Mercado&rsquo;s &ldquo;Media Imperialism in Television&rdquo; that appeared in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/733\"><strong>The Politics of Culture: The Philippine Experience</strong></a></i></b>, 1984, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G. Tiongson</strong></a>; and Renato Constantino&rsquo;s two-part piece entitled &ldquo;The Transnationalization of Communications: Implications on Culture and Development,&rdquo; that appeared in the 1985 issues of <b><i>The Diliman Review</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Recent works using these paradigms, but with a close examination of kinship ties, economic rent-seeking strategies of acquiring wealth and power, the formation of the state, and the growth of civil society groups under specific historico-political contexts are Alfred McCoy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rent-seeking Families and the Philippine State: A History of the Lopez Family&rdquo; in his book<i> <b>Anarchy of Families: State and Family in the Philippines</b></i>, 1994, and Josefina C.

Diverging from the formalist analysis of media texts, a new set of writings began to shed light on the political economy of Philippine broadcasting, its global networks, owners&#x2019; interlocking interests in transnational corporations, and infrastructures that integrated the nation into the globalized world system. Highly influenced by the world systems theory of Immanuel Wallerstein and Marxist theories of cultural imperialism, pioneering works and essays that employed this approach in the study of broadcasting in the Philippines include Gerald Sussman&#x2019;s <b><i>Telecommunications Transfers: Transnational Corporations, the Philippines and Structures of Domination</i></b>, 1981, and &#x201C;The World Bank and Philippines Telecommunications&#x201D; that appeared in a 1987 issue of the journal <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>; Orlando Mercado&#x2019;s &#x201C;Media Imperialism in Television&#x201D; that appeared in <b><i><a href=\"/7/59/733\"><strong>The Politics of Culture: The Philippine Experience</strong></a></i></b>, 1984, edited by <a href=\"/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

The Marcos government in 1968 came out with the monograph series <b><i>Presidential Policy Statement </i></b>that contained transcripts of audio recordings of President Ferdinand Marcos aired on <b><i>Pakinggan ang Pangulo: Radio-Television Chat</i></b> (Listen to the President: Radio-Television Chat) that contained the government&#x2019;s policy issues, including those about broadcast. In the mid-1970s, during the height of the martial law period, the government came out with the magazine called <b><i>The Broadcaster</i></b> which discussed the radio and television thrusts of the Marcos government and other issues faced by the industry. A few notes about broadcast history are included in the books <b><i>Philippine Mass Communications: 1811-1966</i></b>, 1973, by John A. Lent, <b><i>Mass Communication in Asia: A Brief History</i></b>, 1978, by Charles Moses and Crispin Maslog, and <b><i>Philippine Mass Communication: A Mini-History</i></b>, 1990, by Maslog. <b><i>Stay Tuned: The Golden Years of Philippine Radio, A <a href=\"/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Perspective of Philippine Radio</i></b>, 2007, by Benjamin <a href=\"/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceto is a compendium of data about early radio personalities and events. Florangel Rosario-Braid and Ramon Tuazon identified historical shifts and developments in &#x201C;Post-EDSA Communication Media,&#x201D; which appeared in an issue of the journal <b><i>Philippine Studies </i></b>in 2000. The <strong><a href=\"/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> released in 2003 two important monographs that sketched a critical history of broadcasting: <b><i>Radyo: An Essay on Philippine Radio</i></b> by Elizabeth L. Enriquez and <b><i>Telebisyon: An Essay on Philippine Television</i></b> by Clodualdo del Mundo Jr. Recent historical studies that appeared in learned journals are &#x201C;Shooting the Messenger: Why Radio Broadcasting is a Deadly Profession in the Philippines,&#x201D; in <b><i>Journal of Radio Studies</i></b>, 2009, by Rey Rosales; and &#x201C;The Development of News as a Viable Format in Philippine Radio, 1960s to Present: A Study of DZRH and DZBB,&#x201D; in <b><i>Journal of Radio and Audio Media</i></b>, 2011, by Melba Estonilo. A pioneering study that frames broadcast history within the lens of post-colonialism and political economy is<b><i> Appropriation of Colonial Broadcasting: A History of Early Radio in the Philippines, 1922-1946</i></b>, 2008,<b><i> </i></b>by Elizabeth Enriquez."

This is done by instructing and motivating the members of the production team to perform their tasks according to this vision. Hence, the director has the final say with regards to the quality of each member&rsquo;s output. In practice, the role of the director varies between radio and television and the genres within each medium. There are cases when the artistic vision is provided by the producer of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In genres like talk shows, music programs, and commercials that air on mainstream radio, there are no persons designated as directors. The role of the director for talk shows is taken on by the talk show host or the producer of the program who provide both the flow of the content and the artistic tenor of the production. Prior to the airing of an episode of the program, the producer and talk show host agree on the topic for discussion. The producer then gathers materials like music, sound effects, and voice inserts to be aired for the episode. The producer also invites guests, conducts research, and prepares a guide questionnaire for the interview. Armed with these materials, the talk show host directs the flow of the program through the sequence of questions that he or she asks. In music programs, the music director and disc jockey take on the role of the director as they create the playlist. In Citi Lite 88.3 FM, which aired an eclectic mix of contemporary and mainstream jazz, pop, R&amp;B, and New Age musical selections for easy listening, the creation of the playlist begins with the music programming team composed of the music director and disc jockeys auditioning old and new materials from compact disc albums sourced from both here and abroad. While auditioning the music, the team selects and then classifies songs based on genre and year of release. The selection is then approved by the program director for inclusion in the master playlist. Disc jockeys play music from the master list and rotate the airing of the selections based on a number of factors like how old or new the song is and its popularity (Aseron 2015). With the advent of digital playlist technologies, the sequencing and rotation of songs are done automatically. The creative input is limited to the selection of songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In radio commercials, the producer of the material collaborates with a sound designer or jingle composer to achieve the goals set by the creative team of the advertising agency that commissioned the work. The production of radio commercials begins with a feasibility meeting during which the producer presents the objectives of the advertisement, the mood and tone of the material, voice samples, music pegs, and other materials to be used in the production for approval by the creative team of the agency. Once approved, these materials are presented to the client in a preproduction meeting. In this meeting, the creative direction of the production is agreed upon and a go signal is given to proceed with the production. During the production of the commercial, the producer&rsquo;s main role is to guide those involved in the production to ensure that all the creative agreements are met. The produced material is then presented to the agency and then the client for approval for airing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is different for radio dramas in which a director is hired to ensure the quality of the production. The director&rsquo;s work is mostly limited to assigning roles to performers, giving instructions to correct mistakes in the words read, and remedy technical errors. In the recording of a radio drama, each member of the production team and the voice talents are guided by instructions detailed in the drama script. During the recording of the drama, the director listens to the delivery of the talents and sound effects incorporated in the program. The director just interrupts the production to correct the errors in voice delivery, timing, and audio levels made during the recording. This is because the production of radio dramas is already strongly anchored on traditions and conventions that performers and other members of the production team replicate. In the production of a radio drama, the performers and crew perform like a well-oiled machine needing very little direction. For example, if the role of the performer is that of a heroine, tradition dictates that her performancce be coy and sweet-sounding. The sound effects person conveniently follows the script. The music scorer selects canned or original music available in his or her file and uses these selections that fit the general emotion of the scene during the live production or the editing phase. The director guides the technical director during the editing in assembling together all these elements to complete the drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On mainstream television, genres like talk, game, musical, and variety shows that are either pre-recorded or aired live using multiple cameras and real-time editing have a repetitive look and styling. The opening sequences and segments of the same program have the same camera work, lighting, production design, graphics, and other elements. The overall vision for these genres is initially generated by the producer of the program. Upon getting a nod to produce the initial program concept, the producer brings together a creative team that includes a director and writers. At this stage, the director contributes his vision for the look and style of the program. The director fine tunes this look and style during the initial taping or broadcast of the program. Subsequent episodes follow the creative patterns created in the initial episode. For this reason, the role of a director in the following episodes is basically to frame the cameras and provide the rhythm of the real-time editing of the show. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>&rsquo;s variety show <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b>, 2009, the opening sequence starts with the theme music and graphics of the title of the program. It is followed by an intercut of images of the hosts in the audience area singing the theme music of the program with the audience. Subtitles of the lyrics of the theme song are also flashed during this opening number. This is what viewers regularly see every episode of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The direction of segments in these programs is usually done by a segment producer and quality-approved by the producer of the show. At times, the director contributes ideas to new segments of the program. In the event when the program suffers in ratings, the creative team is usually asked to come up with new and creative ways to change or add to the content and treatment of the program with the hopes of generating a stronger audience appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The more theoretical role of a director can be observed in television dramas&mdash;soap operas, teleplays for anthologies, fantasy dramas, and similar genres. In these types of programs, the director interprets the script and conceptualizes a treatment based on his/her vision. The role of a director as a visual storyteller of television dramas in a commercial industry is complicated by the business side of the production. The director&rsquo;s work is expected by management to receive high audience ratings. This then puts pressure on the creativity of the director. The pressure may lead the director to revert to formulaic storytelling, change performers and/or plotlines in the middle of a series, utilize performers with a huge fan base, and other similar strategies to work toward an increase in the viewership of the drama. In the ABS-CBN drama series <b><i>My Binondo Girl</i></b>, 2011, the lead character played by Kim Chiu was supposed to end up marrying the character played by Jolo Revilla. Due to the unfavorable audience reception to the Revilla-Chiu love team, which could have eventually resulted in lower ratings, the plot of the story had to be changed in favor of an ending that saw the elaborate Chinese wedding of the characters that Kim Chiu and Xian Lim portrayed (Marmol 2011). Other pressures include compromising on aspects of the production design like sets and props, rushing the recording of sequences, and other measures to cut the cost of the production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular radio drama directors are also often voice talents.

In these types of programs, the director interprets the script and conceptualizes a treatment based on his/her vision. The role of a director as a visual storyteller of television dramas in a commercial industry is complicated by the business side of the production. The director&#x2019;s work is expected by management to receive high audience ratings. This then puts pressure on the creativity of the director. The pressure may lead the director to revert to formulaic storytelling, change performers and/or plotlines in the middle of a series, utilize performers with a huge fan base, and other similar strategies to work toward an increase in the viewership of the drama. In the ABS-CBN drama series <b><i>My Binondo Girl</i></b>, 2011, the lead character played by Kim Chiu was supposed to end up marrying the character played by Jolo Revilla. Due to the unfavorable audience reception to the Revilla-Chiu love team, which could have eventually resulted in lower ratings, the plot of the story had to be changed in favor of an ending that saw the elaborate Chinese wedding of the characters that Kim Chiu and Xian Lim portrayed (Marmol 2011). Other pressures include compromising on aspects of the production design like sets and props, rushing the recording of sequences, and other measures to cut the cost of the production."

It involves tying sounds and images together to provide shifts and transitions in a specific order of sequences to create continuity, rhythm, and narrative. Editing helps listeners or viewers follow the meaning intended by the program producer and keep them glued to the radio or television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two types of editing emerged in terms of changes in broadcast technology in the Philippines: linear analog editing, from the late 1940s until the early 2000s, and nonlinear digital editing, which began in the late 1980s. Before World War II, recordings were basically mechanical and electrical in character, and amplified or sent to stations via electric signals. Elsewhere in the world, the magnetic era in audio recording began in 1945. Advances in technology led to a wide range of developments until the digital era crept into the picture sometime in the mid-1970s, and gained traction in the Philippines in the late 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All radio productions in the Philippines before and after World War II and television productions beginning in the 1950s were done live in a studio. News reports in the Philippines during the period were feeds from international broadcasts; a few were live coverage of local events. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong> soaps, variety programs, and commercials, in both radio and television, were also aired live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In radio, there was no editing done in the beginning as everything was aired live. If there were any mistakes, there was no way to edit them out. This was why a 15-minute program was carefully scripted and typically rehearsed for three hours. In the USA and Europe, there were early recording instruments that used wires or discs, which looked like giant long-playing records, but there was no editing involved. The discs were called <b>transcriptions</b>. Programs were recorded live and then sent out to other stations for re-broadcast. Some of these recordings were aired on Philippine radio before World War II, but especially towards the end of the war when MacArthur&rsquo;s signal corps brought with them transcriptions of American radio programs to flood the Philippines with, to make it clear they had returned to re-take the country from the Japanese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1940s, the technology of what were called open-reel tape recorders and the magnetic tape was developed. Analog audio editing became possible, but it was manual and involved a slow and tedious process. The editor basically trims unwanted sound by finding the two points between which the sound to be eliminated is found, physically splicing the tape at said points on an editing block, then taping the remaining tape together with a splicing adhesive tape. The angle of the spliced ends of the tape determines the kind of sound transition possible, such as a crossfade or a cut. To add sound involved layering of sounds with a multi-track tape recorder and magnetic tape, which was laborious and time-consuming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, such editing was reserved only for commercials to avoid the lengthy and labor-intensive process that would increase production cost. When the practice of pre-recording soaps was adopted, everything was rehearsed, including music scoring and sound effects that were physically produced using an SFX box or sound effects box, then taped as though the program was live. If there was an error, a re-take was done. Minimal editing was involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television shows were generally shot using a single camera, and with no special effects. For example, Fr James Reuter&rsquo;s production of <b><i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i></b> was broadcast live from a studio of ABS Channel 3 on 16 Nov 1953, making it the first drama aired on Philippine TV. Like newscasts and entertainment programs of the period, &ldquo;cameras would get entangled in wires and not be able to track; actors who had been murdered got up and walked off in full view of the TV audience. Many actors went blank in the middle of scenes&rdquo; (Rodrigo 2006, 40). Newscasters and performers committed mistakes, and they &ldquo;burned in white&rdquo; when cameras were kept on too long (Rodrigo 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In April 1956, a company called AMPEX unveiled a recording device called the Quadruplex during the assembly of the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters in Chicago. It was a huge machine that looked like a refrigerator. All three television networks in the USA owned video recorders by 1957 and began experimenting with ways to edit videotape. Unlike the film material which could be held up against the light to see the image on it, the two-inch tape on an Ampex recorder was viewed on a machine, which had to be stopped at the edit points, marked with a Pentel pen, then cut physically. On television, the first beneficiary of this machine in the Philippines was the music program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1437\"><strong>An Evening with Pilita</strong></a></i></b>, 1964-71, ABS Channel 3. The network bought two units of this equipment in 1964. Each machine costs US $80,000, and each tape costs about Php1,000; indeed, a very expensive investment (Rodrigo 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the USA, television engineers played around with pulse tones to mark the video tapes to achieve accuracy in the editing frame. In the Philippines, pioneer editors had to rely on their physical pulse to feel the rhythm on which to mark the cutting points. In the mid-1960s, Dick Hill, a CBS technician, stumbled on a piece of Defense Department technology that allowed electronic recording of a time clock on magnetic tape. The technology was used by the military to record missile launch data. This led to the application of timecodes to video tape. The timecode made modern video editing possible and eventually led to the creation of nonlinear editing systems. Director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4986\"><strong>Mitos Villareal</strong></a>, using the Ampex recorder, explored the many possibilities of editing for taped episodes of <b><i>An Evening with Pilita</i></b>, such as the split-screen effect in which &ldquo;three Pilitas,&rdquo; a Visayan Pilita, an English Pilita, and a Spanish Pilita, spoke to one another. It was an editing technique first seen on local television at a time of analog broadcast production. A one-hour show then required 24 hours of editing (Rodrigo 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In other countries, the first disk-based nonlinear editing system, the CMX600, was introduced in 1970. Laserdiscs were used as storage devices. Various approximations of nonlinear editing systems were built in the 1980s using computers, multiple laser discs or video cassette recorders using different formats. The most common tape was the Umatic. In under a century, a lot of technological advancements were made in the editing of video. With linear editing, editors had to deal with loss of video quality and challenging ways to produce graphics. The popularity of the nonlinear editing system made editors produce work faster; cutting and inserting footage has become easier, and compositing is less of a challenge with filters and software plug-ins. Ordinary people can buy a nonlinear editing software, install it in their computers, then learn to use it at home. &ldquo;Self-taught&rdquo; has evolved from tinkering with an editing machine to watching instructional videos on YouTube and reading postproduction forums. Just several decades ago, one needed to be apprenticed before learning how to edit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ease of producing a desired output with just a click of a button somehow limits the editors&rsquo; creativity, unlike before when editors were challenged to think of ways to achieve a certain look by experimenting and compositing. The accessibility of the editing software gave way to &ldquo;mere technicians&rdquo;&mdash;people who only know how to operate the software but who have no knowledge of the principles of editing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sound effects person Manuel Salas, audio editor Froilan Malimban, and video editors Nonoy Regalado, Ricardo Paras, Mel Bacani III, and Paul Ticzon have observed some disturbing effects of nonlinear editing technology to production as a whole. Paras, head of the video editing section of GMA, says it succinctly: &ldquo;Ever since the shift from analog tape-based formats to tapeless file-based formats, I noticed a decline in the efficiency of production units when it comes to the acquisition of materials. When tapes (Umatic/Betacam/DVC) were used for acquisition, production teams tended to limit the number of takes, shooting days, etc., with the goal of using up only the allotted or less-than-the-allotted tape stock since these were very expensive. Nowadays, with the lower cost of drives, production units can shoot multiple takes and cure shots since these only translate to files and drive space. Clients also have this &ldquo;fix it in postproduction&rdquo; attitude, thinking that anything can be achieved by the &ldquo;high-tech&rdquo; machines used by the editors. With this attitude, they sometimes forego proper lighting and other production values&rdquo; (Paras 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Different broadcast programs employ varied editing principles, all derived from film theory. These principles depend on the nature of the subject, the intended impact of the production, and the treatment of the work. Terms for editing principles vary or overlap, depending on the classification formulated by different schools of thought and scholars. The most common principles in broadcast are <b>narrative editing</b>, which can be <b>linear</b>, <b>inverted</b>, or <b>parallel</b>; the <b>ellipses</b>, which can create <b>parallelism</b>, <b>synchronism</b>, and <b>anti-thesis</b>; <b>rhythmic editing</b>, which is the creation of cadence; and <b>expressive editing</b>, which involves the fusion of nonrelated images and sound to create meanings or evocations not identified with the same images or sounds if taken individually (Beauvais 1990, Casebier 1976, MacCann 1966, Wollen 1969).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rhythmic editing is derived but has deviated from Eisenstein&rsquo;s principle of metric editing, which is the cutting of sequences based on an absolute measurement of shots, counted in frames, to create a mathematical formulation that characterizes the film&rsquo;s formal aesthetics (Beauvais 1990, Casebier 1976, MacCann 1966). Metric editing is similar to the creation of the cadence or rhyme of a poem, which is dependent on its number of syllables and lines; the measured rhythm is its formal character. Current usage of rhythmic editing in broadcast is not dictated by a fixed number of frames or shots, but by multiple factors, such as the beat of the music, the movement of the images, the composition of shots, and the interest raised and held by these audio and visual elements. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4993\"><strong>Fritz Ynfante</strong></a>&rsquo;s editing style in the dance show <b><i>Penthouse 7</i></b>, 1974-81, GMA, and that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>&rsquo;s in the music variety program <b><i>ASAP</i></b>, which has been running on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> since 1995, can be considered rhythmic, dependent mainly on the tempo of the music. The combination of rhythm and a clearly articulated ideological position is best exemplified in the music video <b><i>HLMX Trilogy</i></b>, 2015, three videos-in-one that present the decades-long struggles of peasants to achieve genuine agrarian reform in the country. Combining the videos together is a little girl traversing the sugarcane field, interspersed with real documentary footage of the struggle for land, and concluding with raised red flags in Hacienda Luisita as a way of paying tribute to the martyrs of the peasantry. An abuse of rhythmic editing is that employed in the coverage of ABS-CBN News Channel, and later ABS-CBN Sports and Action Channel, of the annual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/48\"><strong>Cheerdance</strong></a> Competition of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. Viewers have rightly commented that the cutting of video shots for performances in this kind of a show is less about the rhythm of the music than the tempo of the movements and geometry of lines created by the performers, the level of difficulty of the stunts, and the execution of the transitions, which a simple, long, steady full shot of the performances, with minimal cuts to medium or close shots, could provide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Narrative editing is simply putting together different shots to tell a story. Linear editing is the simplest and most common. It involves the composition of shots or sounds that forward a story in chronological order to achieve temporal and spatial continuity. All genres and formats of local broadcast programs generally follow a chronological sequence of events or activities that are divided into segments. Inverted editing begins at a particular point in the present, leaves this point to flashback a past or jumps to the future through the device of flash forwards, then returns to the present. Inverted editing is generally employed in drama programs and children&rsquo;s fantasy stories. Parallel editing shows two or more separate actions taking place, generally but not necessarily, in different places or times. The actions either converge at a particular sequence or continue their separate movements until a certain pattern of the narrative is produced. The fast-paced parallel cuts in the Mexican telenovela <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, 1996, RPN 9, has greatly influenced the extensive use of this editing technique in local telenovelas like <b><i>Pangako sa &lsquo;Yo</i></b> (<b><i>The Promise</i></b>), 2000, and <b><i>Tayong Dalawa</i></b> (The Two of Us), 2009, both on ABS-CBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Editing involves the compression or expansion of time and space using the principle of ellipses. An <b>ellipse</b> can be explicit, such as the use of dissolves of the same object, place or image in a different time or setting. An ellipse can be implicit, which is a parallel cut of the same object, place or image in a different time or setting but with other audio-visual elements altered to imply the change. The opening sequence of <b><i>Katipunan</i></b>, a drama series about the life of national hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>, 2013, GMA, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4984\"><strong>Ian Victoriano</strong></a> and directed by King Marc Baco, is an excellent example of the use of implicit ellipses, such as light and darkness, innocence and violence, and body movements of sprightliness and fear, which are assembled from scenes of various times and spaces into a montage to simultaneously create parallelism, synchronism, and anti-theses, which are types of editing treatment seen in works by Soviet filmmakers Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolid Pudovkin (Beauvais 1990, Casebier 1976, MacCann 1966). The melancholic tone of the hero&rsquo;s narration and the naivet&eacute; of a young woman running innocently in the sun-drenched virgin forest are marred and negated by inserted sequences of the massacre of revolting men and women peasants in the dead of night and that of a young woman, the same woman in the opening shots, now in pain, molested, running aimlessly in the dark, desecrated forest, until she reaches the edge of the earth and plunges herself into the deep void. Implicit time-space ellipses are extended to shots of bodies of the massacred peasants that are abruptly cut to the young woman&rsquo;s body on a boulder, in another place and time, now dead, lying face down, her eyes staring at the camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some programs use expressive editing, labeled by some scholars as Eisenstein&rsquo;s intellectual montage editing to create a collision of ideas (Beauvais 1990, Casebier 1976, MacCann 1966). Expressive editing juxtaposes nonrelated images, dialogue, and sounds to establish meanings or create feelings that would not have been evoked had these elements not been linked together. The meanings or feelings arise not in the individual shot or sound, but in the fusing together of these elements. Some radio dramas of <b><i>UP <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/621\"><strong>Nating</strong></a> Mahal </i></b>(University of the Philippines, Our Beloved), 2015, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4826\"><strong>DZUP</strong></a> 1602, employed this approach. An example is the episode &ldquo;Sinapupunan&rdquo; (Womb), about a fetus deciding to abort herself or continue the bloody birthing process to face the uncertainties of life in the Third World. Each stage of the process is punctuated by lines from the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Victor Jara, Pablo Neruda, Lu Xun, Otto Rene Castillo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5094\"><strong>Joi Barrios</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5611\"><strong>Lilia Quindoza-Santiago</strong></a>, Fidel Rillo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5428\"><strong>Emmanuel Lacaba</strong></a>, with each excerpt sneaking in and out of the sequences. The final sequence is a montage of multiple tracks of simultaneous sounds of shivering human flesh, splintering bones, bubbling blood of capillaries, the rising vapor of body heat, and the simmering fluid of slimy internal organs, while the uneven soft thuds of a baby&rsquo;s movement is heard, slowly creeping out of her mother&rsquo;s womb.

It involves tying sounds and images together to provide shifts and transitions in a specific order of sequences to create continuity, rhythm, and narrative. Editing helps listeners or viewers follow the meaning intended by the program producer and keep them glued to the radio or television."

				"value": "Two types of editing emerged in terms of changes in broadcast technology in the Philippines: linear analog editing, from the late 1940s until the early 2000s, and nonlinear digital editing, which began in the late 1980s. Before World War II, recordings were basically mechanical and electrical in character, and amplified or sent to stations via electric signals. Elsewhere in the world, the magnetic era in audio recording began in 1945. Advances in technology led to a wide range of developments until the digital era crept into the picture sometime in the mid-1970s, and gained traction in the Philippines in the late 1980s."

News reports in the Philippines during the period were feeds from international broadcasts; a few were live coverage of local events. <strong><a href=\"/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong> soaps, variety programs, and commercials, in both radio and television, were also aired live."

				"value": "In radio, there was no editing done in the beginning as everything was aired live. If there were any mistakes, there was no way to edit them out. This was why a 15-minute program was carefully scripted and typically rehearsed for three hours. In the USA and Europe, there were early recording instruments that used wires or discs, which looked like giant long-playing records, but there was no editing involved. The discs were called <b>transcriptions</b>. Programs were recorded live and then sent out to other stations for re-broadcast. Some of these recordings were aired on Philippine radio before World War II, but especially towards the end of the war when MacArthur&#x2019;s signal corps brought with them transcriptions of American radio programs to flood the Philippines with, to make it clear they had returned to re-take the country from the Japanese."

				"value": "In the late 1940s, the technology of what were called open-reel tape recorders and the magnetic tape was developed. Analog audio editing became possible, but it was manual and involved a slow and tedious process. The editor basically trims unwanted sound by finding the two points between which the sound to be eliminated is found, physically splicing the tape at said points on an editing block, then taping the remaining tape together with a splicing adhesive tape. The angle of the spliced ends of the tape determines the kind of sound transition possible, such as a crossfade or a cut. To add sound involved layering of sounds with a multi-track tape recorder and magnetic tape, which was laborious and time-consuming."

				"value": "In the Philippines, such editing was reserved only for commercials to avoid the lengthy and labor-intensive process that would increase production cost. When the practice of pre-recording soaps was adopted, everything was rehearsed, including music scoring and sound effects that were physically produced using an SFX box or sound effects box, then taped as though the program was live. If there was an error, a re-take was done. Minimal editing was involved."

For example, Fr James Reuter&#x2019;s production of <b><i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i></b> was broadcast live from a studio of ABS Channel 3 on 16 Nov 1953, making it the first drama aired on Philippine TV. Like newscasts and entertainment programs of the period, &#x201C;cameras would get entangled in wires and not be able to track; actors who had been murdered got up and walked off in full view of the TV audience. Many actors went blank in the middle of scenes&#x201D; (Rodrigo 2006, 40). Newscasters and performers committed mistakes, and they &#x201C;burned in white&#x201D; when cameras were kept on too long (Rodrigo 2006)."

				"value": "In April 1956, a company called AMPEX unveiled a recording device called the Quadruplex during the assembly of the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters in Chicago. It was a huge machine that looked like a refrigerator. All three television networks in the USA owned video recorders by 1957 and began experimenting with ways to edit videotape. Unlike the film material which could be held up against the light to see the image on it, the two-inch tape on an Ampex recorder was viewed on a machine, which had to be stopped at the edit points, marked with a Pentel pen, then cut physically. On television, the first beneficiary of this machine in the Philippines was the music program <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1437\"><strong>An Evening with Pilita</strong></a></i></b>, 1964-71, ABS Channel 3. The network bought two units of this equipment in 1964. Each machine costs US $80,000, and each tape costs about Php1,000; indeed, a very expensive investment (Rodrigo 2006)."

				"value": "In the USA, television engineers played around with pulse tones to mark the video tapes to achieve accuracy in the editing frame. In the Philippines, pioneer editors had to rely on their physical pulse to feel the rhythm on which to mark the cutting points. In the mid-1960s, Dick Hill, a CBS technician, stumbled on a piece of Defense Department technology that allowed electronic recording of a time clock on magnetic tape. The technology was used by the military to record missile launch data. This led to the application of timecodes to video tape. The timecode made modern video editing possible and eventually led to the creation of nonlinear editing systems. Director <a href=\"/8/69/4986\"><strong>Mitos Villareal</strong></a>, using the Ampex recorder, explored the many possibilities of editing for taped episodes of <b><i>An Evening with Pilita</i></b>, such as the split-screen effect in which &#x201C;three Pilitas,&#x201D; a Visayan Pilita, an English Pilita, and a Spanish Pilita, spoke to one another. It was an editing technique first seen on local television at a time of analog broadcast production. A one-hour show then required 24 hours of editing (Rodrigo 2006)."

Various approximations of nonlinear editing systems were built in the 1980s using computers, multiple laser discs or video cassette recorders using different formats. The most common tape was the Umatic. In under a century, a lot of technological advancements were made in the editing of video. With linear editing, editors had to deal with loss of video quality and challenging ways to produce graphics. The popularity of the nonlinear editing system made editors produce work faster; cutting and inserting footage has become easier, and compositing is less of a challenge with filters and software plug-ins. Ordinary people can buy a nonlinear editing software, install it in their computers, then learn to use it at home. &#x201C;Self-taught&#x201D; has evolved from tinkering with an editing machine to watching instructional videos on YouTube and reading postproduction forums. Just several decades ago, one needed to be apprenticed before learning how to edit."

Paras, head of the video editing section of GMA, says it succinctly: &#x201C;Ever since the shift from analog tape-based formats to tapeless file-based formats, I noticed a decline in the efficiency of production units when it comes to the acquisition of materials. When tapes (Umatic/Betacam/DVC) were used for acquisition, production teams tended to limit the number of takes, shooting days, etc., with the goal of using up only the allotted or less-than-the-allotted tape stock since these were very expensive. Nowadays, with the lower cost of drives, production units can shoot multiple takes and cure shots since these only translate to files and drive space. Clients also have this &#x201C;fix it in postproduction&#x201D; attitude, thinking that anything can be achieved by the &#x201C;high-tech&#x201D; machines used by the editors. With this attitude, they sometimes forego proper lighting and other production values&#x201D; (Paras 2015)."

				"value": "Different broadcast programs employ varied editing principles, all derived from film theory. These principles depend on the nature of the subject, the intended impact of the production, and the treatment of the work. Terms for editing principles vary or overlap, depending on the classification formulated by different schools of thought and scholars. The most common principles in broadcast are <b>narrative editing</b>, which can be <b>linear</b>, <b>inverted</b>, or <b>parallel</b>; the <b>ellipses</b>, which can create <b>parallelism</b>, <b>synchronism</b>, and <b>anti-thesis</b>; <b>rhythmic editing</b>, which is the creation of cadence; and <b>expressive editing</b>, which involves the fusion of nonrelated images and sound to create meanings or evocations not identified with the same images or sounds if taken individually (Beauvais 1990, Casebier 1976, MacCann 1966, Wollen 1969)."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Rhythmic editing is derived but has deviated from Eisenstein&#x2019;s principle of metric editing, which is the cutting of sequences based on an absolute measurement of shots, counted in frames, to create a mathematical formulation that characterizes the film&#x2019;s formal aesthetics (Beauvais 1990, Casebier 1976, MacCann 1966). Metric editing is similar to the creation of the cadence or rhyme of a poem, which is dependent on its number of syllables and lines; the measured rhythm is its formal character. Current usage of rhythmic editing in broadcast is not dictated by a fixed number of frames or shots, but by multiple factors, such as the beat of the music, the movement of the images, the composition of shots, and the interest raised and held by these audio and visual elements. <a href=\"/8/69/4993\"><strong>Fritz Ynfante</strong></a>&#x2019;s editing style in the dance show <b><i>Penthouse 7</i></b>, 1974-81, GMA, and that of <a href=\"/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>&#x2019;s in the music variety program <b><i>ASAP</i></b>, which has been running on <a href=\"/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> since 1995, can be considered rhythmic, dependent mainly on the tempo of the music. The combination of rhythm and a clearly articulated ideological position is best exemplified in the music video <b><i>HLMX Trilogy</i></b>, 2015, three videos-in-one that present the decades-long struggles of peasants to achieve genuine agrarian reform in the country. Combining the videos together is a little girl traversing the sugarcane field, interspersed with real documentary footage of the struggle for land, and concluding with raised red flags in Hacienda Luisita as a way of paying tribute to the martyrs of the peasantry. An abuse of rhythmic editing is that employed in the coverage of ABS-CBN News Channel, and later ABS-CBN Sports and Action Channel, of the annual <a href=\"/6/46/48\"><strong>Cheerdance</strong></a> Competition of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. Viewers have rightly commented that the cutting of video shots for performances in this kind of a show is less about the rhythm of the music than the tempo of the movements and geometry of lines created by the performers, the level of difficulty of the stunts, and the execution of the transitions, which a simple, long, steady full shot of the performances, with minimal cuts to medium or close shots, could provide."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Narrative editing is simply putting together different shots to tell a story. Linear editing is the simplest and most common. It involves the composition of shots or sounds that forward a story in chronological order to achieve temporal and spatial continuity. All genres and formats of local broadcast programs generally follow a chronological sequence of events or activities that are divided into segments. Inverted editing begins at a particular point in the present, leaves this point to flashback a past or jumps to the future through the device of flash forwards, then returns to the present. Inverted editing is generally employed in drama programs and children&#x2019;s fantasy stories. Parallel editing shows two or more separate actions taking place, generally but not necessarily, in different places or times. The actions either converge at a particular sequence or continue their separate movements until a certain pattern of the narrative is produced. The fast-paced parallel cuts in the Mexican telenovela <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, 1996, RPN 9, has greatly influenced the extensive use of this editing technique in local telenovelas like <b><i>Pangako sa &#x2018;Yo</i></b> (<b><i>The Promise</i></b>), 2000, and <b><i>Tayong Dalawa</i></b> (The Two of Us), 2009, both on ABS-CBN."

				"value": "Editing involves the compression or expansion of time and space using the principle of ellipses. An <b>ellipse</b> can be explicit, such as the use of dissolves of the same object, place or image in a different time or setting. An ellipse can be implicit, which is a parallel cut of the same object, place or image in a different time or setting but with other audio-visual elements altered to imply the change. The opening sequence of <b><i>Katipunan</i></b>, a drama series about the life of national hero <a href=\"/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>, 2013, GMA, written by <a href=\"/8/69/4984\"><strong>Ian Victoriano</strong></a> and directed by King Marc Baco, is an excellent example of the use of implicit ellipses, such as light and darkness, innocence and violence, and body movements of sprightliness and fear, which are assembled from scenes of various times and spaces into a montage to simultaneously create parallelism, synchronism, and anti-theses, which are types of editing treatment seen in works by Soviet filmmakers Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolid Pudovkin (Beauvais 1990, Casebier 1976, MacCann 1966). The melancholic tone of the hero&#x2019;s narration and the naivet&#xE9; of a young woman running innocently in the sun-drenched virgin forest are marred and negated by inserted sequences of the massacre of revolting men and women peasants in the dead of night and that of a young woman, the same woman in the opening shots, now in pain, molested, running aimlessly in the dark, desecrated forest, until she reaches the edge of the earth and plunges herself into the deep void. Implicit time-space ellipses are extended to shots of bodies of the massacred peasants that are abruptly cut to the young woman&#x2019;s body on a boulder, in another place and time, now dead, lying face down, her eyes staring at the camera."

				"value": "Some programs use expressive editing, labeled by some scholars as Eisenstein&#x2019;s intellectual montage editing to create a collision of ideas (Beauvais 1990, Casebier 1976, MacCann 1966). Expressive editing juxtaposes nonrelated images, dialogue, and sounds to establish meanings or create feelings that would not have been evoked had these elements not been linked together. The meanings or feelings arise not in the individual shot or sound, but in the fusing together of these elements. Some radio dramas of <b><i>UP <a href=\"/7/58/621\"><strong>Nating</strong></a> Mahal </i></b>(University of the Philippines, Our Beloved), 2015, <a href=\"/8/69/4826\"><strong>DZUP</strong></a> 1602, employed this approach. An example is the episode &#x201C;Sinapupunan&#x201D; (Womb), about a fetus deciding to abort herself or continue the bloody birthing process to face the uncertainties of life in the Third World. Each stage of the process is punctuated by lines from the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Victor Jara, Pablo Neruda, Lu Xun, Otto Rene Castillo, <a href=\"/9/80/5094\"><strong>Joi Barrios</strong></a>, <a href=\"/9/80/5611\"><strong>Lilia Quindoza-Santiago</strong></a>, Fidel Rillo, and <a href=\"/9/80/5428\"><strong>Emmanuel Lacaba</strong></a>, with each excerpt sneaking in and out of the sequences. The final sequence is a montage of multiple tracks of simultaneous sounds of shivering human flesh, splintering bones, bubbling blood of capillaries, the rising vapor of body heat, and the simmering fluid of slimy internal organs, while the uneven soft thuds of a baby&#x2019;s movement is heard, slowly creeping out of her mother&#x2019;s womb. Embedded in this multi-layered mix is the guitar music of &#x201C;Jocelynang Baliuag,&#x201D; the theme song of the Philippine revolution of 1896. The cacophony of sounds ends in a burst of contracting muscles, a deep sigh, and a triumphant cry of a baby.

Though some major broadcast organizations do not maintain KBP membership, they nonetheless have their own professional codes that, to an extent, echo the Broadcast Code of the Philippines. As such, a practitioner in any broadcast organization will always have a basis for what constitutes an ideal broadcast professional in the field. The Broadcast Code of the Philippines, as well as the respective codes of other broadcast organizations, contain provisions that attempt to address different situations that a practitioner may face. Ranging from provisions tackling on-air decorum, news and public affairs, individual rights, and children&rsquo;s programming and welfare, professional codes for broadcast exhaustively prescribe the expected traits and courses of action to practice the profession in a responsible, moral, honest, and fair manner (KBP 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Normally, broadcast practitioners need only take the provisions of these codes to heart for guidance on how to rightfully practice their profession and guide them in producing content. However, there have been instances not covered by these codes, or situations that may be called grey areas, where thoughtful ethical behavior should have taken over. Classic examples from news programs include the attribution of criminal suspects&rsquo; minority religions (i.e., Muslim terrorists but never Christian ones), inclusion of personal opinions in news reports, and robbing interviewees&rsquo; of dignity by focusing on their plight of misery. These practices have led to the &ldquo;standardization&rdquo; of unethical practices that do not contribute relevant information for the public interest or general welfare. In entertainment, a well-known incident decried by the public as child abuse on-air involved the prolonged ridicule of a minor contestant by a variety show&rsquo;s host in spite of the obvious distress of the child. In a competing variety program, hosts frequently exchanged offensive barbs by using homophobic language and slurs that shamed game contestants for their physical appearances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Critics contend that the above examples, widely used in broadcast media, have led to these practices being accepted as normal behavior, evidenced by the rather common use of offensive slurs and the loss of basic courtesy and respect in everyday life.

Before the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UN CRC) in 1990, the child&rsquo;s privacy was not considered an issue. Radio and television coverage did not hide faces and identities of children who had been victims of sexual molestation, rape, incest, physical abuse, criminalization, and other forms of exploitation. Showing the young victims was not perceived to be a violation of the children&rsquo;s right to privacy. Child rights groups were instrumental in pointing out to broadcasters that mass media is so invasive and widespread that a single news coverage can impair the present situation of the child as well as his/her future. Interviews by broadcasters and the subsequent portrayal of the child may traumatize the child victim even more. Up to the early 1990s, it was unthinkable for TV coverage to show faceless children. Generally, it was perceived that a faceless or concealed character on TV will not hold audience attention and thus be inimical to audience ratings. By late 1990s, child rights groups in the Philippines stepped up its campaign to popularize the ethical standards in the media coverage of children. These groups held dialogues and educational campaigns to build a child-friendly broadcast media. In 1999, the Department of Justice issued its own guidelines on child reporting. Unfortunately, the early years of the campaign resulted in the avoidance of broadcast media to cover children&rsquo;s issues because of the complicated process of covering children. Finally, 17 years after the UN CRC, the KBP also released a clear-cut guideline in Article 3 &ldquo;Coverage Involving Children&rdquo; of the Broadcast Code of the Philippines.

Actors, musicians, announcers, and other performers are often hired on a per-project or even per-episode basis. They are called talents, whose employment in effect is contractual. Others, including regular production staff and crew whose services are required on a regular, daily basis, are hired as permanent employees after six months of probation, in compliance with labor laws in the Philippines. However, beginning in the 1990s, broadcast companies have resorted to rampant contractualization not only of those traditionally called talents but also of many middle- to low-ranked employees whose services are necessary on a daily or regular basis.

An example is Presidential Decree No 1986, which created the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4910\"><strong>Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)</strong></a>. It provides the guidelines for the classification of programs fit for particular age groups, such as General Patronage (&ldquo;G&rdquo;), Parental Guidance (&ldquo;PG&rdquo;), Strong Parental Guidance (&ldquo;SPG&rdquo;), and Disapproved for Airing on Television (&ldquo;X&rdquo;). The idea is to ensure that children are not unnecessarily exposed to material that is deemed incompatible to them psychologically and emotionally. These ratings likewise allow parents to monitor the content of what broadcasts their children are exposed to, and guide them accordingly. PD 1986, combined with Republic Act No 8370 or The Children&rsquo;s Television Act of 1997, protects children&rsquo;s minds, which are viewed as vulnerable and impressionable, by classifying and formulating programs that are regarded as child-friendly and beneficial to their continued growth and development. Consequently, in producing content, broadcasters are wary of material or subject matter that can affect the rating of their programs. Those who produce programs exclusively for very young children take care that the programs do not contain anything unsuitable to a G rating. On the other hand, those gearing for teenage viewing should keep in mind the criteria relevant to theme, language, nudity, sex, violence, horror, and drugs, considered by the MTRCB for classifying programs under PG or SPG. Nonconsideration of the criteria may lead to the disapproval of a program&rsquo;s airing under the X classification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the protection and care for children, laws are also put in place to preserve the rights of individuals. Since everyone has the right to a good reputation, libel and slander laws were put in place under Articles 353 to 364 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. These provisions define what constitutes defamatory material, and the manner by which they are made in order to constitute the crime of either libel or slander. Needless to say, in the exercise of a free press, the broadcast practitioner should remember the forms of speech and expression that fall outside the protection of the Constitutional Guarantee. To illustrate this, broadcasters and program hosts who make spiteful or hateful accusations and assertions against other persons on air may expect a criminal case filed against them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another right that needs protection by law is the right of an individual to be credited or to profit from the products of one&rsquo;s intellect and industry. Hence, the existence of Republic Act No 8293 or the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines. This law defines what intellectual property rights are accorded to authors, entrepreneurs, and inventors, creating certain kinds of works. In addition, the law provides for the acts which constitute violation of intellectual property rights, and which acts do not. It also provides for the legal remedies available in the event that intellectual property rights are violated. Those behind a station&rsquo;s programming should make sure to secure the rights of an original work from its author in case they wish to adapt the same into a program, or use the same in any way, shape, or form, during any of their shows. Also, broadcasters, especially those in commentaries and editorials, should always be wary of paraphrasing or quoting the works of others lest they violate intellectual property rights in instances of misattribution or making none at all. The broadcast practitioner should always bear in mind that as far as intellectual property is concerned, when in doubt, permission from the original author should be secured, and the proper attribution be made. The Doctrine of Fair Use as found in RA 8293 gives leeway to use works and materials for comment, criticism or news reporting, without violating the owner&rsquo;s intellectual property rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from laws and regulations that directly affect the production of broadcasts, there are also those that can indirectly affect the same. Among the practices of broadcast organizations today is one that attempts to go around the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, or the Labor Code of the Philippines. This practice involves the constant renewal of broadcast practitioners as contractual workers, denying them the financial and social benefits accorded regular employees who are essential and necessary for the broadcast organizations. This practice reduces expenses and increases profit for the broadcast organization, but at the expense of the practitioner who is put into a position where one&rsquo;s skills and talents cannot be maximized. Such a work environment leads to demoralization due to the fact that years, and in some instances decades, worth of service is not recognized because of the denial of employment status that these practitioners are qualified for and deserve. In effect, broadcast practitioners might be tempted to commit unethical acts for increased financial gain; to give minimal effort to the programs they produce, thus denying their employers, and by extension the audience, the products of their full potential; or to be disillusioned with their profession, thereafter leaving their dreams and visions on the table, again to the detriment of the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another legal development that can affect production is the move to amend the provision in the constitution limiting ownership and operation of media to Filipinos.

				"value": "Laws and regulations of the Philippine government can significantly affect the kind and quality of programs that may be broadcast. An example is Presidential Decree No 1986, which created the <a href=\"/8/69/4910\"><strong>Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)</strong></a>. It provides the guidelines for the classification of programs fit for particular age groups, such as General Patronage (&#x201C;G&#x201D;), Parental Guidance (&#x201C;PG&#x201D;), Strong Parental Guidance (&#x201C;SPG&#x201D;), and Disapproved for Airing on Television (&#x201C;X&#x201D;). The idea is to ensure that children are not unnecessarily exposed to material that is deemed incompatible to them psychologically and emotionally. These ratings likewise allow parents to monitor the content of what broadcasts their children are exposed to, and guide them accordingly. PD 1986, combined with Republic Act No 8370 or The Children&#x2019;s Television Act of 1997, protects children&#x2019;s minds, which are viewed as vulnerable and impressionable, by classifying and formulating programs that are regarded as child-friendly and beneficial to their continued growth and development. Consequently, in producing content, broadcasters are wary of material or subject matter that can affect the rating of their programs. Those who produce programs exclusively for very young children take care that the programs do not contain anything unsuitable to a G rating. On the other hand, those gearing for teenage viewing should keep in mind the criteria relevant to theme, language, nudity, sex, violence, horror, and drugs, considered by the MTRCB for classifying programs under PG or SPG. Nonconsideration of the criteria may lead to the disapproval of a program&#x2019;s airing under the X classification."

Since everyone has the right to a good reputation, libel and slander laws were put in place under Articles 353 to 364 of the Revised Penal Code of the Philippines. These provisions define what constitutes defamatory material, and the manner by which they are made in order to constitute the crime of either libel or slander. Needless to say, in the exercise of a free press, the broadcast practitioner should remember the forms of speech and expression that fall outside the protection of the Constitutional Guarantee. To illustrate this, broadcasters and program hosts who make spiteful or hateful accusations and assertions against other persons on air may expect a criminal case filed against them."

Hence, the existence of Republic Act No 8293 or the Intellectual Property Code of the Philippines. This law defines what intellectual property rights are accorded to authors, entrepreneurs, and inventors, creating certain kinds of works. In addition, the law provides for the acts which constitute violation of intellectual property rights, and which acts do not. It also provides for the legal remedies available in the event that intellectual property rights are violated. Those behind a station&#x2019;s programming should make sure to secure the rights of an original work from its author in case they wish to adapt the same into a program, or use the same in any way, shape, or form, during any of their shows. Also, broadcasters, especially those in commentaries and editorials, should always be wary of paraphrasing or quoting the works of others lest they violate intellectual property rights in instances of misattribution or making none at all. The broadcast practitioner should always bear in mind that as far as intellectual property is concerned, when in doubt, permission from the original author should be secured, and the proper attribution be made. The Doctrine of Fair Use as found in RA 8293 gives leeway to use works and materials for comment, criticism or news reporting, without violating the owner&#x2019;s intellectual property rights."

				"value": "Aside from laws and regulations that directly affect the production of broadcasts, there are also those that can indirectly affect the same. Among the practices of broadcast organizations today is one that attempts to go around the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, or the Labor Code of the Philippines. This practice involves the constant renewal of broadcast practitioners as contractual workers, denying them the financial and social benefits accorded regular employees who are essential and necessary for the broadcast organizations. This practice reduces expenses and increases profit for the broadcast organization, but at the expense of the practitioner who is put into a position where one&#x2019;s skills and talents cannot be maximized. Such a work environment leads to demoralization due to the fact that years, and in some instances decades, worth of service is not recognized because of the denial of employment status that these practitioners are qualified for and deserve. In effect, broadcast practitioners might be tempted to commit unethical acts for increased financial gain; to give minimal effort to the programs they produce, thus denying their employers, and by extension the audience, the products of their full potential; or to be disillusioned with their profession, thereafter leaving their dreams and visions on the table, again to the detriment of the audience."

Moving from one medium to another has been evident even during the early days of radio and television. Among those who performed on several platforms in the first decades of radio and television were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3991\"><strong>Jovita Fuentes</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a> dela Rama, Katy dela Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\"><strong>Chichay</strong></a>, Dely Atay-Atayan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a>, Eddie San Jose, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a>, and Sylvia La Torre. Performers from the stage brought their performance techniques and styles into radio and television. For instance, the traditions and conventions of <i>bodabil</i> were found in blocktime radio programs during the American colonial period and up to the first several years of television. An example of this type of program is <b><i>Oras ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> </i></b>(Happy Hour), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>, 1965-71, where bodabil<i> </i>slapstick humor was a staple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:distribute-all-lines\">In the last few decades of the 20th century, some of the notable performers on several platforms and genres were Nora Aunor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4969\"><strong>Tessie Tomas</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4974\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4975\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4976\"><strong>Noel Trinidad</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3235\"><strong>Lea Salonga</strong></a></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\"><strong>Charo Santos</strong></a>, Joey de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4673\"><strong>Judy Ann Santos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4264\"><strong>Boots Anson</strong></a>-Roa, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4979\"><strong>Ariel Ureta</strong></a>. The movement from one medium to another continues in the industry, bringing with it the changing styles in performance. In early radio drama, the over-stylized external form of dramatic acting was brought over from theater, particularly the <i>komedya</i> and bodabil. (See &ldquo;Theater&rdquo; in <b>Sources and Influences in Philippine Radio and Television</b>.) In the 1970s, the more organic internalized style of acting that became popular in Philippine movies directed by the likes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\"><strong>Ishmael Bernal</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a> found its way into radio and television drama. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Performance styles are also influenced by other factors. Global trends in radio performance were adopted by local announcers. Having been strongly influenced by American broadcast, the early days of radio announcing followed the American mid-western accent that was the norm in the United States. Filipino disc jockeys tried to sound like their American counterparts. More recently, the roots of the <i>masa</i> programming on FM radio, so called due to its appeal to the masses, as exemplified in the program <b><i>Tambalang Balasubas at Balahura </i></b>(A Swindler and a Filthy Tandem) hosted by Nicole Hyala and Cris Tsuper on DZMB 90.7, can be traced to the free-wheeling, risqu&eacute;, and adult radio programming in the US. Local comedy bar humor and performance style is also evident on <i>masa </i>radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Performers change their styles according to the conventions of the medium into which they move. For example, Mike Enriquez used a well-modulated and mellow baritone voice with an Americanized speech pattern while he was a DJ from 1969 on various radio stations, where English was the announcing language. Upon becoming a newscaster for GMA Channel 7 in 1995, Enriquez adopted the frenetic and strident style of live broadcast news by sounding agitated and hurried, foregoing his smooth and relaxed style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Performance styles are also affected by the training the performer undergoes. Training can come from learning on the job, instructions of directors, and formal schooling. Formal training for broadcast performance, specifically for radio announcing, first appeared in Speech and Drama programs, and later in Mass Communication courses, in universities. (See <b>Education and Training</b>.) Workshops and seminars on performance are also given by organizations like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4861\"><strong>Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas (KBP)</strong></a> and broadcast networks like ABS-CBN and GMA. Performers like Eloisa Cruz Canlas, popularly known as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Sela Bungagera</i></b> (Loudmouth Grandma Sela), took in young apprentices to hone their talent in voice acting for radio. Performers must also acquire technical skills like using various types of microphones, applying makeup, and camera blocking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even with training and talent, breaking into the mainstream broadcast industry is difficult. The star system prefers the established bankable stars, even if they are not well-trained, over new and untested performers with talent and the training in broadcast performance. Such preferences affect the quality of the programs produced in mainstream radio and television. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Fernando A.

In early radio drama, the over-stylized external form of dramatic acting was brought over from theater, particularly the <i>komedya</i> and bodabil. (See &#x201C;Theater&#x201D; in <b>Sources and Influences in Philippine Radio and Television</b>.) In the 1970s, the more organic internalized style of acting that became popular in Philippine movies directed by the likes of <a href=\"/4/26/4295\"><strong>Ishmael Bernal</strong></a> and <a href=\"/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a> found its way into radio and television drama. </span>"

Having been strongly influenced by American broadcast, the early days of radio announcing followed the American mid-western accent that was the norm in the United States. Filipino disc jockeys tried to sound like their American counterparts. More recently, the roots of the <i>masa</i> programming on FM radio, so called due to its appeal to the masses, as exemplified in the program <b><i>Tambalang Balasubas at Balahura </i></b>(A Swindler and a Filthy Tandem) hosted by Nicole Hyala and Cris Tsuper on DZMB 90.7, can be traced to the free-wheeling, risqu&#xE9;, and adult radio programming in the US. Local comedy bar humor and performance style is also evident on <i>masa </i>radio."

It assembles and choreographs visual elements to highlight the emotion and feel of a show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As applied art, in production design the visible elements of line, shape, color, texture, value, and space are employed to produce a unity or variety through the principles of balance, proportion, rhythm, harmony, and emphasis. These elements are imbedded in the materials of production design which come in the form of dress, adornment, functional and decorative objects, spaces, and places that are placed according to the context of period, geography, time frame, and duration of the material.The basic principle in combining these elements is to enrich, not to steal, the scene away from the actors or narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The relationship of the production designer with key people of a TV production, like the producer and the director, is essentially one of collaboration and mutual dependence.The designer addresses the intents of the director and concretizes them accordingly. He gives the director the material world of the program or story as closely as it is envisioned. The production designer collaborates with the director of photography or videographer, to ensure that the world is recorded appropriately. The production designer relates and communicates the design as accurately and as quantifiably as possible to the producer so that the designgets all the financial and logistical support for it to be realized at the time it is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bulk of design work happens in preproduction, during which research, discussions, brainstorming, drawing, ocular inspections, location hunting, planning, fittings, scheduling, cost estimates, bidding, purchasing, and sourcing of materials happen. This is the phase in which the designer conjures the material and photographable world of the story and operationalizes it according to visual elements and principles as applied to objects, places, spaces, and periods or time. In the production stage, the conceived world is transformed to its material existence and recorded by the camera, subjecting design to the language of the lens and the camera. At this phase, the exigencies that come with the coverage of the designer&rsquo;s work affect the amount of detail and/or broad view of this world. For this reason, it is important that the director of photography, the director and production designer are on the same page all the time. In postproduction, the role of design mostly comes in the form of consultation and verification because all these concerns must have already been taken up during the preproduction and production phases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The elements and principles for nondramatic and dramatic TV productions are the same. The difference lies in the basis of design. In nondramatic material, the basis of the design is the TV program profile or brief, which outlines its aims and objectives, mood and tone, the profile or persona of the broadcast personality, program format, and the target audience. In a dramatic or fiction material, the basis of design is the narrative. This difference creates a shift in the responsibility of the designer towards the material. In nondramatic material, the designer&rsquo;s sense towards existing tastes, trends, and sensibilities in industry practice and audiences is more direct. In dramatic material, this sense is more related towards the story or narrative as envisioned by the director, writers, and members of the creative team.In television nowadays, however, the boundary between dramatic and nondramatic materials in production design has been taken down. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong>tic materials may take the elements of nondramatic materials and vice versa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The visual look of the structures and decorations may either be realistic or imaginary, or may adhere to a specific art movement, or a combination of any of these depending on what is required by the concept of a show.

The set was constructed to fit the TV studio, like in Fr James Reuter&rsquo;s production of Edmond Rostand&rsquo;s <b><i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i></b>, considered the first TV drama production, aired live in 1953 on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>. Similar designs that were theatrical in orientation in terms of production design and aired live from the studio premises were Fr Reuter&rsquo;s <b><i>Family Theater</i></b>, early 1960s; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1479\"><strong>Obra Maestra</strong></a></i></b>, late 1960s, both on ABS-CBN (Rodrigo 2006). The anthology <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>in ng Buhay</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2232\"><strong>Mirror</strong></a> of Life), 1960s, ABS-CBN, was one of the first drama shows that recorded episodes outside the studio to enhance the realism of the narrative (Francisco 2005). The design for the contemporary drama series <b><i>My Husband&rsquo;s Lover</i></b>, 2013, GMA, is realistic as it depicted the look of the everyday lives of its middle-class characters. <b><i>Mulawin</i></b>, 2004-05, GMA, a fantasy drama showed the imaginary world of winged humans. <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko</i></b> (You Are Okay, My Fairy), which premiered in 1987, IBC 13, combined both the realistic and the imaginary and moved from the real-life settings to the fantasy kingdom of Enkantasya Magenta, the lead character&rsquo;s mother-in-law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most types of programs require production design except for documentaries in which the real look and conditions of the subject or topic have to be documented. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1412\"><strong>Batas Militar</strong></a></i></b> (Martial Law), a documentary produced by the Foundation of Worldwide People Power in 1997, used footage showing actual scenes from the martial law era. But in historical documentaries and similar genres where re-enactments are needed, the services of a designer are warranted. Scenes depicting the life of <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong> were designed by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2973\"><strong>Gino Gonzales</strong></a></strong> for the documentary <b><i>Ang Buhay ni Jose Rizal </i></b>(The Life of Jose Rizal), 1996, produced by the Bookmark Inc and the History Department of the Ateneo de Manila University. Some documentary, public affairs, and talk programs combine realism and expressionism in the style of the studio set, such as those employed by <b><i>Review Night</i></b>, 2001,<b><i> </i></b>Cinema <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>, and <b><i>Storyline</i></b>, 2011, ABS-CBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Computer-generated effects have helped a lot in terms of managing the scope of the production designer&rsquo;s work especially in set construction, getting the most ideal locations, make-up issues such as aging and prosthetics, and risky and dangerous live effects.These effects should complement, not steal, the artistic and philosophical basis upon which the design is based. The drama serials from ABS-CBN, like the supernatural-adventure series <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1461\"><strong>Lobo</strong></a> </i></b>(Werewolf), 2008, and <b><i>Juan de la Cruz</i></b>, 2013; from GMA, such as the fantasy serial <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1436\"><strong>Encantadia</strong></a></i></b>, 2005, and the epic drama <b><i>Amaya</i></b>, 2011-12; and from GMA News TV, the historical drama <b><i>Ilustrado </i></b>(The Enlightened), 2014, employed computer-generated effects to recreate make-believe worlds and the Philippines during its pre-colonial and Spanish colonization periods which include elements of architecture, weaponry, jewelry, fashion, and customary practices. In <b><i>Amaya</i></b>, an existing hull of a modern boat was redesigned to reconstruct the <i>karakoa</i>, an ancient Filipino warship. Many scenes from these drama series were shot in a so-called sound stage, a studio that houses a green or blue chroma, permanent lighting, and a virtual set system that produces computer-generated moving or still graphics of environments over which moving actors and objects are placed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New technologies have made possible various alternatives to design the look of a show. A virtual set system fits a computer-generated colossal set into a small studio. People, cameras, lighting, and computer graphics of places, events, and other visual elements move together in real time of three-dimensional spaces. In this setup, set designs are no longer built physically, but in software. Designs for background environments, particularly those that are complex, huge, and expensive, are built in a software, transformed digitally, and embedded onto the actual studio images of actors and other visual elements. The virtual set technology has been used in the creation of the new opening billboards for TV5&rsquo;s news programs and for creative storytelling segments in some children&rsquo;s shows on various broadcast networks (Unitel 2011).&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4239\"><strong>Leo Abaya</strong></a>, Fernando A.

The schedule is usually organized into daily and weekly grids, in some cases for a longer period of time, such as a month or a quarter, with positions of programs like newscasts presumed to be more or less stable over an indefinite period of time. The basic principle is to schedule programs so that they reach the maximum number of target audiences. A common programming strategy is to match the schedule with listener and viewer habits. For example, after World War II, audience research suggested that housewives, the target of the early soap operas, comprised the bulk of radio listeners during the day. Thus, dramas were aired accordingly, with advertising spots of mostly household and consumer goods also placed at these hours. The early evening hours, on the other, hand, were believed to have the largest audience size, with all the members of the family presumed to be home. These hours came to be known as primetime, at which programs with the broadest appeal are scheduled. While audience habits and the demands of living in the late 20th and early 21st centuries have shifted, with programming adjusting to the shifts, and while audience segmentation has become finer, with audiences using multiple media platforms, the principle of programming remains the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the beginning of broadcasting in the Philippines, which was in the 1920s during the American colonial period, programming on radio has followed the American radio programming structure, which was 15-minute programs of music, variety, and the less common news and talk shows. After World War II, both radio and television programming continued to be influenced by the American model. On radio, dramas and news remained at 15 minutes but variety shows and musicals expanded to one hour. In television, the importation of many canned shows from the United States to fill in broadcast time determined local programming structure. Sitcoms (situational comedies) and news programs ran for thirty minutes while drama series and documentaries ran for an hour. Locally-produced programs then conformed to this configuration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, popular canned US programs filled the local television airwaves, but local producers began experimenting with the live variety shows <b><i>Pista ng Caltex</i></b> (Caltex Fiesta) and, migrated from radio,<b><i> Darigold Jamboree</i></b>, <b><i>United American Tiki-Tiki Show</i></b>, <b><i>Ang Inyong Lingkod,</i></b> <b><i>Tia Dely</i></b> (At Your Service, Aunt Dely), and the popular amateur singing contest <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b> (Call of the Stage). While the 1960s continued the trend of mixed canned and local programming, local television began to produce more shows that gained popularity among Filipino audiences. Among these were live musical-variety programs such as the sponsored <b><i>Lucky Strike Show</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1437\"><strong>An Evening with Pilita</strong></a></i></b> featuring singer and actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, <b><i>Buhay Artista</i></b> (Actor&rsquo;s Life) with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a> and Panchito, and the <b><i>Nida-Nestor Show</i></b> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a> and Nestor de Villa. The latter part of the decade saw the emergence of the drama anthology <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1970s were again dominated by American canned programming as some local television producers dropped out, shifted to another medium, or reconfigured programs to conform to the media restrictions imposed by martial law. However, this was also the period of the phenomenally successful sitcom <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a></i></b> (John and Marsha) and musical variety show <b><i>Superstar</i></b>. Also popular were the soap operas <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b> and <b><i>Anna Liza</i> </b>airing on pre-primetime. Notable of the period were the noontime variety programs <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-Boo!). This noontime variety programming trend remains in effect as formats of the same program prevail in current programming. <b><i>Eat Bulaga</i></b>, on the air since 1979,<b> </b>is the longest running television program in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1980s, stations continued to be tentative about creating new programs. However, this careful stance led to the production of cultural programs that were considered also a safe bet, such as the classical music programs <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1482\"><strong>Paco Park Presents</strong></a></i></b>, and the Filipino music show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1400\"><strong>Aawitan Kita</strong></a></i></b> (I Will Sing for You). With more contemporary musical formats were <b><i>Martin and Pops Twogether</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1502\"><strong>Ryan Ryan Musikahan</strong></a></i></b> (Music with Ryan). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a> programs also flourished with notable television counterparts of the soap operas <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fate) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1448\"><strong>Ilaw ng Tahanan</strong></a></i></b> (Light of the Home) and the drama anthologies <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i> </b>hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4854\"><strong>Eddie Ilarde</strong></a>&rsquo;s<b> <i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday). The 1980s also saw more children&rsquo;s programming with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>bot</i></b><i> </i>(Small but Strong) setting the model for educational children&rsquo;s shows and similar programs like <b><i>Pen Pen de Sarapen</i></b> (children&rsquo;s rhyme) and <b><i>Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Lucky Seven Club</i></b>. Comedy programs were also popular with the gag programs <b><i>TODAS</i></b> (acronym for Television&rsquo;s Outrageously Delightful All-Star Show) and <b><i>Champoy</i></b> (name of a sweet-and-salty dried fruit) starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4974\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4975\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4976\"><strong>Noel Trinidad</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4849\"><strong>Subas Herrero</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Programming developments immediately after the EDSA revolt in 1986 led to a drastic change in programming, particularly in news and current affairs. News programs stretched to one hour while primetime programs like drama series, anthologies and sitcoms extended to an hour and a half. Euphoria following the ouster of Marcos produced vibrant news and public affairs talk programs while post-EDSA sentiments were sharply evident in all other programs. Among the public affairs programs that emerged during the period were <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Probe Team</i></b> hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4879\"><strong>Cheche Lazaro</strong></a> and <b><i>Public Forum</i></b> hosted by UP professor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4800\"><strong>Randy David</strong></a>. Also notable were the parodies and satires <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1401\"><strong>Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata</strong></a></i></b> (Watch Out for the Next Episode), <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue</i></b>, and <b><i>Sic O&rsquo;Clock News</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For a decade this programming held up, until 1996 when the unknown telenovela <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, a canned soap from Mexico, captivated audiences. It aired on RPN Channel 9, then considered a small player. In four months after the initial airing of the program, <b><i>Marimar</i></b> was number one in ratings. This led to the adjustments of then industry number one <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> of its primetime programming, shortening the newscast <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b> from an hour to thirty minutes, and moving its top-rating soap opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1466\"><strong>Mara Clara</strong></a></i></b> to pre-primetime. This development completely shifted Philippine primetime programming. Soap operas, which used to occupy nonprimetime slots, are now in primetime. Stripping, the primetime strategy of putting programs on a daily basis instead of only once a week became the primary programming strategy. The change brought back importation of canned programs, this time from sources other than the US. Later programming shifts similar to the <b><i>Marimar</i></b> phenomenon included the anime wave in the late 1990s to early 2000s with the return of the Japanese cartoons, now dubbed in Filipino, <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> and <b><i>Daimos</i></b>. The game show battles in the early 2000s with programs <b><i>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</i></b> and <b><i>The Weakest Link</i></b> led to the steady influx of franchised programs, beginning in turn the trend of local franchises including <b><i>Pinoy Big Brother</i></b>, <b><i>Survivor Philippines</i></b>, <b><i>Pilipinas Got Talent</i></b>, and <b><i>The Voice</i></b>. Asian imports followed suit in the new millennium when ABS-CBN aired the cult hit <b><i>Meteor Garden</i></b>, ushering in the importation of more canned programs from Korea and Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These trends show that local programming continues to be shaped by foreign programming trends, Filipino reactions and accommodations of such trends, as well as homegrown Filipino productions.</p><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Jane O.

This noontime variety programming trend remains in effect as formats of the same program prevail in current programming. <b><i>Eat Bulaga</i></b>, on the air since 1979,<b> </b>is the longest running television program in the country."

It aired on RPN Channel 9, then considered a small player. In four months after the initial airing of the program, <b><i>Marimar</i></b> was number one in ratings. This led to the adjustments of then industry number one <a href=\"/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> of its primetime programming, shortening the newscast <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b> from an hour to thirty minutes, and moving its top-rating soap opera <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1466\"><strong>Mara Clara</strong></a></i></b> to pre-primetime. This development completely shifted Philippine primetime programming. Soap operas, which used to occupy nonprimetime slots, are now in primetime. Stripping, the primetime strategy of putting programs on a daily basis instead of only once a week became the primary programming strategy. The change brought back importation of canned programs, this time from sources other than the US. Later programming shifts similar to the <b><i>Marimar</i></b> phenomenon included the anime wave in the late 1990s to early 2000s with the return of the Japanese cartoons, now dubbed in Filipino, <b><i>Voltes V</i></b> and <b><i>Daimos</i></b>. The game show battles in the early 2000s with programs <b><i>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire</i></b> and <b><i>The Weakest Link</i></b> led to the steady influx of franchised programs, beginning in turn the trend of local franchises including <b><i>Pinoy Big Brother</i></b>, <b><i>Survivor Philippines</i></b>, <b><i>Pilipinas Got Talent</i></b>, and <b><i>The Voice</i></b>. Asian imports followed suit in the new millennium when ABS-CBN aired the cult hit <b><i>Meteor Garden</i></b>, ushering in the importation of more canned programs from Korea and Taiwan."

The person who writes this text is the <b>scriptwriter</b>. Other people who may be involved in the scriptwriting process are the producer, director, script supervisor, and brainstormer. The latter is a person who discusses and throws ideas into a discussion group tasked to develop a program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Radio scriptwriting.</b> The main elements of radio scriptwriting are voice and dialogue, sound effects, and music. The radio scriptwriter is always conscious of the microphone and indicates the speaker&rsquo;s proximity to the equipment. There are specific writing guidelines for every program type&mdash;whether variety, quiz, talk, counseling, or drama. The latter has several genres such as comedy, satire, melodrama, action, adventure, fantasy, and horror, each with particular conventions and techniques (De Leon 1983, 1-24).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The discipline to meticulously write radio scripts was well established before World War II. Program producers and directors were often also the scriptwriters. Among the more memorable programs for which scripting was key were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1506\"><strong>Si Aling Juanang Mapag-impok</strong></a></i></b> (The Thrifty Madam Juana), an early model of the drama and advice program, produced, written, and hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4833\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong></a> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a></i></b> (Tall Tales), a precursor of the situation comedy that satirized Filipino manners, customs, politics, and government, produced by Horacio de la Costa and written by Narciso Pimentel and Jesus Paredes. Both aired beginning in 1938 but were interrupted by war (Enriquez 2008). After World War II, theater artists pioneered in radio scriptwriting for mass-oriented programs using the local language. In 1947, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5503\"><strong>Epifanio Gar. Matute</strong></a> collaborated with director Narciso Pimentel to reprise the pre-war KZRM program and produce the satirical scripts of the long-running radio show <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b>, which then first aired over DZPI produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2908\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a>tic Philippines</strong></a>. The stories revolved around the idiosyncrasies and entanglements of a <i>kalesa</i> (horse-drawn rig) driver named Teban and the members of his family. <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero&rsquo;s</i></b> scripts contributed much to the success of the program with its timely tirades on corrupt politicians and funny comments on social issues. The show articulated the sentiments of the masses through folk and pop humor. Owing to its mass appeal, <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> was translated into theater, television, and film. Another theater artist, Conde Ubaldo, wrote and directed the comedy-drama <b><i>Kuwentong Kapitbahay </i></b>(Neighborhood <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a>) also in 1947 over DZRH. It was made into a movie with the same title in 1952 using the storyline of a barrio lass who is admired and chased by an American soldier, a common experience after World War II. There are other radio scriptwriters who succeeded in romantic comedy, like Virgilio &ldquo;Beer&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> who wrote <b><i>Edong Mapangarap</i></b> (Edong the Dreamer) for DZFM and <b><i>Sebya Mahal Kita</i></b> (I Love You, Sebya) for DZXL. Both series were made into films (Matute 1997, vii-ix; Dolor 2010; Soriano 1981, 32).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first 30-minute drama is the educational program entitled <b><i>Counsel for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency</i></b> from a concept by Manila Mayor Manuel de la Fuente and Olympia Ubaldo. It was hosted and directed by Rosalino Flores over KZRH. Literary writers ventured successfully into radio scriptwriting. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> Arceo broke into the world of broadcast with her 15-minute serial melodrama <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1448\"><strong>Ilaw ng Tahanan</strong></a></i></b> (Light of Home). It became a big hit when it first aired over DZMB in Aug 1949 and continued until 1958. Soon, other drama programs were produced. Carolina Flores-Trinidad aka Lina Flor wrote<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fate) and <b><i>Dr. Ramon Selga. </i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5272\"><strong>Genoveva Edroza-Matute</strong></a><b><i> </i></b>created<b><i> Aklat ng Pag-ibig </i></b>(Book of Love). Other literary writers from print media who became radio scriptwriters for drama were Fausto Galauran and Susana de Guzman. These top-rating drama shows were supported by big advertisers like the Philippine Manufacturing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, later known as Procter &amp; Gamble PMC. With the success of daytime drama programs, other companies like Colgate Palmolive also sponsored these programs with high listenership. To capture nighttime listeners, producers ventured into action, horror, and adventure. Scriptwriters were Clodualdo del Mundo for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1489\"><strong>Prinsipe Amante</strong></a> </i></b>(Prince Amante), Mabini Centeno for <b><i>Tatlong Limbas</i></b> (Three Crime Busters), Froilan Villegas for <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim </i></b>(Night of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\"><strong>Horror</strong></a>), and Abraham Cruz and Ric Aquino for <b><i>Konsiyerto ng Kamatayan </i></b>(Concert of Death)<b><i> </i></b>(Soriano 1981, 32).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1953, the long-running advice program hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a>, <b><i>Kasaysayan sa mga Liham kay Tiya Dely </i></b>(Stories in the Letters to Tiya Dely), over DZRH hit the airwaves. The counseling program required collaborative effort between its host and writer. Dely Magpayo would read a heap of letters every day and choose the ones to be written for dramatization by scriptwriter Lydia Collantes-Villegas. Magpayo reviewed the drama script before she gave her on-air advice (Lo 2008).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio scriptwriting became a lucrative career during the &ldquo;golden age of radio drama&rdquo; in the 1950s up to the 1960s. Successful radio scriptwriters at the time were Milo Castelo, Paterno Cosme, Loida Flores-Viri&ntilde;a, Johnny Legarda, Eddie Naval, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ng Bagabaldo, Jose Miranda Cruz, Joe &ldquo;Jingle&rdquo; Reyes, Max Roman Garcia, Ramona Pablo, Marina Feleo-Gonzales, Jimmy Navarro, and Madia-as Digdigan Buenaflor. Radio writers gravitated to film writing when many of the best-loved drama series were bought by film producers. Some radio programs that became films were <b><i>Kapitan Kidlat</i></b> (Captain Lightning), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Oras ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a></i></b> (Happy Hour), <b><i>Lagalag</i></b> (Wanderer), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Basyang</i></b> (Grandma Basyang), and <b><i>Gulong ng Palad</i></b>. A testament to the drawing power of radio was the tendency of famous movie stars to host their own radio shows. For example, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> Pictures commissioned Genoveva Edroza-Matute to write the radio scripts for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\"><strong>Gloria Romero</strong></a>&rsquo;s drama program, <b><i>Ang Inyong Lingkod, Gloria Romero</i></b> (At Your Service, Gloria Romero), 1959-60, DZRH, sponsored by Coca-Cola. Romero was already the &ldquo;queen&rdquo; of Philippine movies, yet Sampaguita Pictures saw the opportunity to strengthen her position through radio. Edroza-Matute wrote each episode based on a Filipino proverb. Its lead female character, played by Romero, is the epitome of goodness, humility, and decency. Male voice actors opposite Romero were famous movie stars like Jose Mari, Romeo Vazquez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4461\"><strong>Luis Gonzales</strong></a>, Juancho Gutierrez, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The dominance of the radio drama in the airwaves during this time may be partially attributed to effective scriptwriting. Most radio scriptwriters then were either degree holders in art and literature or were already known for their creative writing ability. These were the writers who conducted research, studied their characters in relation to plot and theme, and knew the difference between the conventions of a short story or short drama from that of a serialized novel or drama series. They were disciplined, making sequence treatments before proceeding to actual writing. Another reason for the success of radio dramas in the 1950s and the 1960s was the fact that radio scriptwriters were also producers and directors who knew the other aspects of the medium. For example, Fundador Soriano was producer, director, and writer of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4854\"><strong>Eddie Ilarde</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kahapon Lamang </i></b>(Only Yesterday) over DZXL, which was a big hit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the succeeding decades, many scriptwriters continued to make their mark in the radio broadcast industry. The next generation of radio writers included Noel de Leon, Julie Fe-Navarro, Reynaldo Duque, Virgilio Vitug, Salvador Royales, Zenaida Soriano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4966\"><strong>Gina Marissa Tagasa</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4934\"><strong>Lucy Quinto</strong></a>, Gil Soriano, and Cris Dalus. Mario O&rsquo;Hara honed his skills as a radio drama writer before he became a film and television writer, director, and actor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1960s to the 1970s, music programs on radio had a wide and loyal following. The scripts for the music programs gave the song titles, their composers and lyricists, and often also their theme and content; anecdotes about the compositions and their inspiration; and poetry about love and emotions that matched the sentiments in the songs and the listeners&rsquo; penchant for romance (Enriquez, 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The popularity of radio began to decline in the early 1980s with the dominance of television. Veteran radio writers reckon that its downhill turn was also due to the deterioration of radio scriptwriting and the unimproved quality of radio productions. Producers hired amateur writers to cut production cost. Radio stations demanded that writers produce stories at a faster rate. In 1981, with an exchange rate of seven pesos to a dollar, anecdotal evidence has it that DZRH and DZXL paid 25 pesos for a script that ran for 30 minutes while DWWW paid 30 pesos. To increase their earnings, writers produced eight to nine scripts a day, resulting in the proliferation of predictable, rehashed, and unresearched stories lacking in depth and devoid of absorbing plots, well-developed characterization, and engaging dialogues (Carballo 2009; Soriano 1981, 34-35).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Television scriptwriting. </b>The kinds of television writing vary according to the types of TV programs, such as melodrama, fantasy, horror, reality, documentary, magazine, situation-comedy, gag, talk, musical variety, and quiz show. The scriptwriter is in charge of making the copy which serves as the blueprint to guide production planning, director&rsquo;s treatment, lighting design, and production design. An ideal scriptwriter is both innovative and mindful of the commercial demands of the TV medium. S/he must write a script that is doable according to budget yet able to sustain audience interest and earn good audience ratings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitcom writing was developed with the pervasive influence and popularity of the Dolphy and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a> tandem in the family sitcom <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), 1973-90, RPN-9. Touted as one of the most highly-rated sitcoms in Philippine TV history, the concept and script of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4831\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a> Fernando</strong></a> may be credited for its huge success. Fernando used the comic talent and charisma of Dolphy as John Puruntong, the &ldquo;Filipino Everyman&rdquo; who is the husband of Marsha, the daughter of a filthy-rich woman named Delilah Jones, played by Fernando&rsquo;s real-life sister Dely Atay-atayan. Fernando was the most prolific comedy writer-director at the time who also created <b><i>Duplex </i></b>on RPN 9, <b><i>Chicks to Chicks</i></b> on IBC 13, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong>Apartment</strong></a> 153-A</i></b> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> (Ramos 2012; IMDb <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b> 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1970s to the 1990s, sitcom writing prospered with shows that experimented with all sorts of characters and settings. <b><i>Iskul Bukol </i></b>(School Bumps), 1977-90, IBC 13, was about the delinquent students of Wanbol University, led by the comic trio Tito, Vic, and Joey, and scripted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4917\"><strong>Bibeth Orteza</strong></a>. <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko! </i></b>(You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy!)<i>,</i> 1987-97, first broadcast over GMA 7, was also written by Orteza who developed the characters of a repair man named Enteng Kabisote and his fairy wife, Faye. <b><i>Home along da <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1272\"><strong>Riles</strong></a></i></b> (Home along the Railroad), 1994-2003, ABS-CBN was about the adventures of a poor family living along the railroad tracks written by Loida Viri&ntilde;a, Jose Bartolome, Divino Reyes, and Herman Salvador from the story concept of Roy Vera Cruz. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1401\"><strong>Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata</strong></a> </i></b>(Wait for the Next Chapter), 1991-97, ABS-CBN, scripted by writer-director Joey Reyes, parodied Philippine politics. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another type of comedy writing is the gag show. Joey de Leon, a talented gag writer, found himself on camera with <b><i>T.O.D.A.S.</i></b> (Television&rsquo;s Outrageously Delightful All-Star Show), 1977-89, a gag show with a motley cast that included Val Sotto, Richie D&rsquo; Horsie, Maribeth Bichara, Frieda Fonda, Spanky Rigor, and Jimmy Santos. An effective gag script allows improvisation and ensemble acting among its performers. This is exhibited in trendsetting gag shows like <b><i>Tropang Trumpo</i></b> (Troop of Tops), 1994-99, ABC 5, with Dan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>ante and Al Tantay as writers. The script template of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1419\"><strong>Bubble Gang</strong></a></i></b>, premiered in 1995 on GMA Network, was patterned after <b><i>Tropang Trumpo </i></b>(IMDb <b><i>Tropang Trumpo</i></b> 2015; <b><i>TODAS</i></b> IMDb 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Writing for the TV drama is one of the most developed fields in TV scriptwriting. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><strong>Komiks</strong></a>, theater, and literature are the main sources and influences in TV drama scriptwriting. This is best exemplified by the drama anthology <b><i>Balintataw </i></b>(The Mind&rsquo;s Eye), 1967-72, ABC 5. The show&rsquo;s writers and creative consultants are competent artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4596\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4597\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4598\"><strong>Elwood Perez</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, Mauro Avena, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\"><strong>Tony Perez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4462\"><strong>Joey Gosiengfiao</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5663\"><strong>Ninotchka Rosca</strong></a>, Sr Maria Angela Barrios, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a>. Brocka was later named National Artist (Matignas 2012, 21-44). Unfortunately, the growing influence of <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> in local television was aborted by the declaration of martial law. At the height of martial rule in the 1970s, government-controlled TV networks produced well-written drama series by Jose Mari Lee. These were <b><i>Alindog </i></b>(Allure), 1976-89, a drama anthology featuring Alma Moreno essaying various lives of women in Filipino society; <b><i>Ulila</i></b> (Forsaken) top billed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4651\"><strong>Rosa Rosal</strong></a>, 1976-80; and <b><i>Peping Ang Munting Anghel </i></b>(Peping the Little Angel)<i>,<b> </b></i>1976-79, featuring child actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4958\"><strong>Romnick Sarmenta</strong></a> as Peping, a favorite character in the durable radio and TV soap opera, <b><i>Gulong ng Palad </i></b>(Video 48 2009).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After Marcos&rsquo;s ouster in 1986, which signaled a new era in media production, television writing became a good source of income for writers until the 1990s even though TV writing still could not provide a secure living since TV shows come and go. Writers then were mostly freelancers. Nevertheless, it has been the goal of many aspiring writers to enter television because of the handsome pay it gives relative to writing for print or radio. But entering television also means that the writer is willing to compromise individual aesthetic preferences in favor of the commercial interests of the producer or the network. Mainstream TV is a free medium supported by advertising and big business. The broadcast outputs in such a setup serve the demands of the business. TV is a fleeting medium and writers are less recognized in this setup, given the daily grind of TV production and the fast turnover of shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Theater writers easily switch to the TV medium given their skill in building dramatic conflict with the use of colorful characters and dialogue. Television gained from the creative inputs of playwrights like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3070\"><strong>Liza Magtoto</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\"><strong>Rody Vera</strong></a>, Rene Villanueva, Ronnie Tumbokon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3193\"><strong>Floy Quintos</strong></a>, and Jun Lana. <i>Komiks</i> has always been a source of both stories and writers for television, as exemplified by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4458\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5339\"><strong>Pablo S. Gomez</strong></a></strong></a>, Carlo Caparas, Vincent Kua, RJ Nuevas, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5540\"><strong>Gilda Olvidado</strong></a>. Meanwhile, fictionists and prose writers like Fanny Garcia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5104\"><strong>Lualhati Bautista</strong></a>, and Suzette Doctolero also ventured into television. Amado Lacuesta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4705\"><strong>Jake Tordesillas</strong></a>, Roy Iglesias, Racquel Villavicencio, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4510\"><strong>Ricardo Lee</strong></a> were mainly film screenwriters who also switched to broadcast arts, especially when mainstream cinema declined in the 1990s. From radio broadcasting, Loida Viri&ntilde;a and Gina Marissa Tagasa succeeded in television writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For many decades since the advent of TV broadcasting, most scriptwriters were self-taught. There was a dearth in scriptwriting courses that trained writers in the art and practice of TV writing. Ricardo Lee started his writing workshop in 1982. Among the participants of Lee&rsquo;s workshops were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4500\"><strong>Armando Lao</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4485\"><strong>Jeffrey Jeturian</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4239\"><strong>Leo Abaya</strong></a>, Vincent Kua, and Peping Almojuela. Lee developed workshop modules for writing the teleplay as well as for writing the television magazine show. Some of the participants were Ned Trespeces, Dado Lumibao, Jerry Sineneng, Lynda Casimiro, and Richard Reynante. After the EDSA revolt, the weekly drama anthology featuring new stories every week was still the dominant type of drama program (Lee 2015). Armando Lao subsequently developed his teleplay writing workshop in the 1990s based on the traditional three-act format and the three-act restorative format, with focus on effective devices in milieu, plot, and characterization. His workshops eventually developed into modules on the concepts and mechanics of the found story, which is highly influenced by the documentary genre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The aforementioned workshops helped aspiring TV writers to learn and to master the basics of teleplay writing in the Philippine setting. These learning sessions honed the craft of writers and provided them the venue to raise the level of TV writing by education, training, and sharing of skills and knowledge. Meanwhile, teleplay writing contests, such as the first and only ABS-CBN Scriptwriting Contest in 1990, and the Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards teleplay category sought to promote TV writing through competition. In 2012, Cine Filipino launched its annual competition with a TV series category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Writing for the documentary and magazine show became popular after the 1986 EDSA revolt with the proliferation of shows that feature socio-political issues, tackle nationalistic themes, and promote Philippine culture. Before and shortly after the EDSA revolt, magazine and public affairs shows were mostly in English, produced by news teams with journalistic background. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4882\"><strong>Loren Legarda</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>PEP Talk</i></b> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4879\"><strong>Cheche Lazaro</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Probe </i></b>were considered glossy because they were written in English. The shows that changed the old paradigms were those that were written in Filipino: <b><i>Sic O&rsquo;Clock News</i></b>, 1987-89, and <b><i>Truth Forum</i></b>, 1986, both over IBC-13; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1451\"><strong>Isip Pinoy</strong></a> </i></b>(Filipino Psyche), 1987, over RPN 9.<b><i> </i></b>The latter shows tackled controversial issues such as prostitution, live sex shows aka <i>toro</i>, censorship, violations of human rights, the abolition of the US Bases, and urban poor demolition. Soon, television public affairs shows written in Filipino became the norm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 2000s, economic and technological developments fundamentally affected TV scriptwriting. The new situation pushed the weekly drama anthology to near extinction. The challenging condition was brought about by the intense rivalry among TV networks, the battle for high ratings, the drive for increased profits to cover mounting production expenses, and the rise of new media competing with television. The medium needed new programming that would deliver faithful viewership. The new situation favored shows like reality TV, game show, and the daily soap opera aka <b>teleserye</b><i>/</i>telenovela.<b> </b>Soap operas in the previous decades were shown in the afternoon, usually after the noontime variety show. By the 2000s, the daily 30-minute melodrama based on the paradigm of the Mexican telenovela dominated not only daytime programming but also evening primetime slots. A telenovela, to be cost-effective, must run for six months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The dominance of the daily soap opera in TV commercial programming ended the role of the scriptwriter as the sole author of the drama script. To secure creative control over soap opera programs, commercial TV networks contracted dedicated writers tasked to write the daily series which would run for a minimum of three months. With high ratings, a telenovela can run for over a year. Within the airing period, writers dedicate their time to the telenovela on a 24/7 schedule. The writer, who always writes with a group, submits to a hierarchical organization that directs the story, characters, and plot based on TV ratings and feedback from social media. The hierarchy has several levels: on top is the business unit head who acts as the overall producer representing the interests of the network. Under the top business manager is the creative manager or the creative consultant who directs the work of the writers. Assisting the creative manager is the head writer who is responsible for the performance of the senior and junior writers, who are the episode writers. Then under the episode writers are the brainstormers whose role is to throw in ideas or to act as devil&rsquo;s advocate during scriptwriting and story conferences. At any point in the writing process, the director may also intervene. The complicated setup allows little room for the individuality and personal vision of the scriptwriter. Every episode of the soap opera bears the imprint of all the levels of the business and creative organization. The writer solves problems on a daily basis and may be required to do actual writing and revision on the set. Telenovela writing under such conditions can drive writers, head writers, and creative managers to the point of burnout. On the other hand, those who survive the system emerge as disciplined writers who can write scripts under the most stressful conditions. Despite the untold travails of the telenovela writer, the fact remains that it is a lucrative profession that also provides job security when one is contracted for many years by the TV network (Lee 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The variety show is a TV program that has survived the test of time and ratings. Long-running noontime shows like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a> </i></b>(Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!) that premiered in 1979 require a different kind of scriptwriting. Composed of different portions and segments, the noontime variety show employs a host of writers under a head writer. Writers are assigned to specific portions ranging from comedy skit, game portions, quiz segment, beauty pageant, talent contest, canned videos, to musical portions. Writing for the variety show entails a complex process that includes research, creating new games and gimmicks, writing spiels for the hosts, and writing the guide in the conduct of games and quizzes. Scriptwriting is an important factor in the longevity of variety shows. The role of writers in <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>, which celebrated 35 years in 2014, helps to keep the show afloat amid the challenges of network competition, new trends, intrigues, censorship, fluctuations in ratings, and changing audience preferences (Eat Bulaga 2004).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Regional scriptwriters.</b> <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>Sarsuwela</strong></a></i> and <i>komedya</i> writers in the Visayas and Mindanao easily turned to radio scriptwriting with the advent of the broadcast industry. This is exemplified by the career of Leyte-born playwright Herculano Borneo Sr. In 1939, the playwright migrated to resettlement areas in Cotabato and in 1951, he moved to Davao City. Borneo became the president of the Mindanao Dramatic Club in Davao City and worked as a part-time radio commentator, which opened doors for his full-length play <b><i>Luyo sa Dag-um</i></b> (Behind the Clouds), 1953, serialized in DXAW. He also produced skits for Davao City&rsquo;s government hour program in 1956 (Dalagan 2001, 31-33).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A Cebuano radio scriptwriter who produced drama shows that became hits on TV is Marcos Navarro Sacol. He created <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b> in the 1970s which was turned into a soap opera by RPN 9 starring child star Janice de Belen in 1978. He was also the writer of the radio comedy, <b><i>Manok ni San Pedro </i></b>(Saint Peter&rsquo;s Rooster), which was produced by RPN 9 in 1977. In the 1990s, Sacol wrote and directed the famous Cebuano fantasy telenovela entitled <b><i>Si Goot Da Wanderpol, Ang Handumanan ni Teban ug Goliat </i></b>(Goot the Wonderful, As Remembered by Teban and Goliat). The comic telenovela carries the record of being one of the most highly rated shows in Cebu. It is about a goat that excretes coins and the misadventures of two comic characters Teban and Goliat, played by Julian Daan and Alan Nacorda. The two actors broke with convention because their ordinary looks are the antithesis of the mestizo faces typical of soap opera leading men. The huge success of the two-year telenovela turned Daan and Nacorda into celebrities with a mass following in the Visayas and Mindanao. Julian &ldquo;Teban&rdquo; Daan, who is also a writer, moved on to become a successful politician in Cebu province. He created the highly-rated radio comedy-drama and counseling program in the 2010s entitled <b><i>Kun Ako ang Pasultihon</i></b> (If I Were to Speak) over DYHP RMN network<b><i> </i></b>(Tomada 2006, Mindanao Examiner 2012). The various periods of radio and television history demonstrate the significant role of writers and the necessity of good scripts to come up with cost-effective and highly rated programs. Whether writing is done in a solitary manner or with a team, the paramount objective is to generate loyal listeners and viewers. The increasing centralization of the writing process is a trend in the commercial broadcast stations because of the corporate perception that firm control is the key to ensuring advertising and audience support. Broadcast productions that are not in this highly competitive mode, such as blocktimers, can offer more democratic space for writers. However, blocktimers are now a marginalized sector in the broadcast industry.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rosalie S.

				"value": "The discipline to meticulously write radio scripts was well established before World War II. Program producers and directors were often also the scriptwriters. Among the more memorable programs for which scripting was key were <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1506\"><strong>Si Aling Juanang Mapag-impok</strong></a></i></b> (The Thrifty Madam Juana), an early model of the drama and advice program, produced, written, and hosted by <a href=\"/8/69/4833\"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href=\"/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong> and <b><i><a href=\"/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a></i></b> (Tall Tales), a precursor of the situation comedy that satirized Filipino manners, customs, politics, and government, produced by Horacio de la Costa and written by Narciso Pimentel and Jesus Paredes. Both aired beginning in 1938 but were interrupted by war (Enriquez 2008). After World War II, theater artists pioneered in radio scriptwriting for mass-oriented programs using the local language. In 1947, <a href=\"/9/80/5503\"><strong>Epifanio Gar. Matute</strong></a> collaborated with director Narciso Pimentel to reprise the pre-war KZRM program and produce the satirical scripts of the long-running radio show <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b>, which then first aired over DZPI produced by <a href=\"/7/60/2908\"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href=\"/4/21/1063\"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href=\"/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong>tic Philippines</strong>. The stories revolved around the idiosyncrasies and entanglements of a <i>kalesa</i> (horse-drawn rig) driver named Teban and the members of his family. <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero&#x2019;s</i></b> scripts contributed much to the success of the program with its timely tirades on corrupt politicians and funny comments on social issues. The show articulated the sentiments of the masses through folk and pop humor. Owing to its mass appeal, <b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero</i></b> was translated into theater, television, and film.

With high ratings, a telenovela can run for over a year. Within the airing period, writers dedicate their time to the telenovela on a 24/7 schedule. The writer, who always writes with a group, submits to a hierarchical organization that directs the story, characters, and plot based on TV ratings and feedback from social media. The hierarchy has several levels: on top is the business unit head who acts as the overall producer representing the interests of the network. Under the top business manager is the creative manager or the creative consultant who directs the work of the writers. Assisting the creative manager is the head writer who is responsible for the performance of the senior and junior writers, who are the episode writers. Then under the episode writers are the brainstormers whose role is to throw in ideas or to act as devil&#x2019;s advocate during scriptwriting and story conferences. At any point in the writing process, the director may also intervene. The complicated setup allows little room for the individuality and personal vision of the scriptwriter. Every episode of the soap opera bears the imprint of all the levels of the business and creative organization. The writer solves problems on a daily basis and may be required to do actual writing and revision on the set. Telenovela writing under such conditions can drive writers, head writers, and creative managers to the point of burnout. On the other hand, those who survive the system emerge as disciplined writers who can write scripts under the most stressful conditions. Despite the untold travails of the telenovela writer, the fact remains that it is a lucrative profession that also provides job security when one is contracted for many years by the TV network (Lee 2015)."

The increasing centralization of the writing process is a trend in the commercial broadcast stations because of the corporate perception that firm control is the key to ensuring advertising and audience support. Broadcast productions that are not in this highly competitive mode, such as blocktimers, can offer more democratic space for writers. However, blocktimers are now a marginalized sector in the broadcast industry.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rosalie S. Matilac</strong> </em>"

The concept of self-regulation in the Philippine broadcast industry is closely identified with the declaration of martial law in 1972 and the establishment on 27 Apr 1973 of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas (KBP). Recognized by the government, the KBP, in effect, has the authority and power to regulate almost all the broadcast media networks nationwide, especially radio. Broadcast media owners rationalized that having one voice and one common identity would send the message to government that they were capable of regulating their ranks. In reality, and media owners were aware of this, self-regulation equates to &ldquo;deflecting full government control over the industry&rdquo; (Feliciano 2007). Under martial law, however, the independence of the KBP was suspect, especially because Teodoro Valencia, its president beginning in Jun 1974, was also the head of the Broadcast Media Council (BMC), a government regulation body created through Presidential Decree 576 on 9 Nov 1974. Valencia was a well-known newspaper columnist, whom critics would label a Marcos apologist. Media owners during martial law, however, were very cautious of government intrusion into the media, especially so when almost all radio and television stations were closed by then Pres Marcos. Freedom of expression and the survival of the broadcast industry as a business enterprise were major concerns. Media owners are business persons, and they have self-interests to protect. The less government interference, the better it is for the public, the practitioners, and the owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The KBP during the martial law period saw to it that the BMC regulation of a limit of 13 minutes of advertising per clock-hour of commercial load on radio was strictly observed. Another important self-regulation policy required playing Original Pilipino Music every broadcast hour. Beginning with one song per program hour in 1975, the requirement was brought up to four in 1982. In 1977, the KBP established the announcers&rsquo; accreditation program that required all persons who went on air regularly to know basic professional and ethical standards. Beginning in 1981, broadcasters had to pass an accreditation examination to qualify them to go on-air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Self-regulation has its own complicated, and at times awkward, twists and turns. In what is now known as the Bartolome Case, the Supreme Court in 1987 affirmed the authority of the KBP to enforce its code of conduct among its members. It upheld the KBP decision to ban from the air for life KBP member Rolando Bartolome, a blocktimer in several KBP member stations, due to numerous and repeated violations of the KBP rule prohibiting personal attacks, profanity, and attacks on KBP itself on air. The regulatory functions of the broadcast industry were transferred to the KBP when the BMC was abolished when martial law was officially lifted in Jan 1981. The KBP formed its own body, the KBP Standards Authority, which formulated program and advertising<u style=\"text-underline:black thick\"> </u>standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a private organization, membership in the KBP is voluntary. Not all broadcast networks are members; some come and go depending on the network&rsquo;s management.

Violations committed by members put KBP and its self-disciplining function on the spot. Several high-profile cases have compelled KBP to respond to public outcry, which subsequently necessitated revisions on the KBP Broadcast Code. One notable case is the Rizal Park hostage-taking incident on 23 Aug 2010, which involved a suspended police officer and several Chinese tourists, eight of whom were killed. The hostage taker himself was gunned down by police authorities. The event brought to the fore the role and capability of broadcast to handle and cover crises like hostage-taking.

This became the headline news for several weeks. The passionate and intense reaction from the public forced TV5 to suspend Revillame and reformat the program. The amendments to the KBP Broadcast Code on the media coverage of children also came from the practitioners themselves, media owners, and stakeholders, especially child advocates. Major revisions in the Broadcast Code were made on Article 6 (Crime and Crisis Situations), Article 3 (Coverage Involving Children), Article 11 (Children&rsquo;s Program and Welfare), and Article 17 (Quiz Shows, Contests, Public Participation Programs, and Promotion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In advertising, KBP is able to suspend accounts that have liabilities to member stations.

To do this, the scorer uses existing or prerecorded instrumental music or songs from various sources. On pre-taped programs requiring postproduction work, a musical scorer must also record or dub the audio output to the final master tape. At its most basic, musical scoring is used to signal the start and end of a program, as well as to signal the start and end of segments within the body of a program. A short piece of music or sound effect, called a stinger, is used in the opening and end credits. As the show progresses, other pieces of music and sound effects are played to engage the audience. Other popular conventions include the use of canned laughter and applause, popular music, theme songs, and background music to heighten the emotional impact of scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A musical scorer that works on live radio and TV programs like variety shows and newscasts is called a &ldquo;spinner.&rdquo; The term appears to be a local and a literal one, derived from the turntable and open-reel machines that the spinner literally spins forward or backward to operate. The spinner sits in the control booth, along with the audioperson, technical director, and, in the case of television, TV director. During the early years of TV, the spinner of a variety show typically operated two tapecaster machines that played eight-track tapes; two turntables and two open-reel machines patched to a mixing desk operated by the audioperson, who controlled the volume level for the microphones used by the hosts, and also had an eye out for the channel track assigned to the spinner. Except for the playback machines, which have been replaced by computers, and new functionalities that allow the hardware to connect wirelessly to each other, the design of the signal path has remained the same to this day. The spinner would cue one tapecaster machine to play laughter; the other tapecaster to play applause; and the turntables and open-reel machines to play music and other sound effects. A variety show would have many musical numbers, and it was the spinner&rsquo;s job to cue the tape that would play the minus-one musical accompaniment. For easier recall, sections of the reel would be marked with paper so the spinner only had to pause the &ldquo;forward&rdquo; button of the machine to that section of the reel. Scoring for a live TV program not only demanded tremendous technical expertise but also an impeccable sense of timing. It required one to be a technician with a well-developed musical ear. There is only one other field of endeavor in which both qualities are highly valued: radio broadcasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most, if not all, of the pioneering scorers in the Philippines started out in radio as soundmen, voice talents, foley artists or live sound effects producers for radio dramas, or simply assistants who delivered the vinyl LPs and tapes for the program. The equipment on board was the same and therefore familiar: playback machines and mixing desks patched to amplifiers, which in turn are connected to transmitters carrying the sound far and away to every listener tuned in. The workflow was similar as well: watching the action from a control booth, selecting and cueing the music and sound effects to be used throughout the program, operating the playback machines, and ensuring that the volume of the music or effects did not overpower the dialog. Further attesting to the similarity of radio and TV as work environments is the fact that some popular radio shows even had a TV equivalent, as in the case of <b><i>Ang Inyong Lingkod, Tiya Dely</i></b> (At Your Service, Aunt Dely), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>, from 1959 until the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ruben Cadsawan and Angel Cruz, who later adopted the name Argel Joseph when he became a TV director, scored the first local TV drama, <b><i>Hiwaga sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>Bahay na Bato</strong></a></i></b> (Mystery at the Stone House), ABS-CBN in 1963, based on the radio drama by Jose Miranda Cruz. In the early years of radio and TV, scoring was done live. At the end of a drama segment going to commercial break, the scorer played bridge music, a piece of suspense music to accompany the cliffhanger. Mainly foreign movie soundtracks were used at this time. The advent of videotape in the early 1960s allowed production teams to record programs and then edit them afterwards for greater quality control. TV networks started building soundstages and postproduction facilities. In 1968, ABS-CBN built the first media facility in the Philippines, the Broadcast Center on Bohol Avenue, Quezon City. It was here that the longest-running TV sitcom in Philippine history, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), was first produced in the early 1970s, also scored by Cruz.

Therefore, a music kit for a drama would differ greatly from that of a comedy or a documentary. Theme music is selected for the opening and closing credits, as well as for special edits like montages within the body of the program.

In the days of hardware-based linear editing, music and sound effects could only be dubbed to tape. Mistakes could be edited out but only after much time and effort.

To do this, the scorer uses existing or prerecorded instrumental music or songs from various sources. On pre-taped programs requiring postproduction work, a musical scorer must also record or dub the audio output to the final master tape. At its most basic, musical scoring is used to signal the start and end of a program, as well as to signal the start and end of segments within the body of a program. A short piece of music or sound effect, called a stinger, is used in the opening and end credits. As the show progresses, other pieces of music and sound effects are played to engage the audience. Other popular conventions include the use of canned laughter and applause, popular music, theme songs, and background music to heighten the emotional impact of scenes."

				"value": "A musical scorer that works on live radio and TV programs like variety shows and newscasts is called a &#x201C;spinner.&#x201D; The term appears to be a local and a literal one, derived from the turntable and open-reel machines that the spinner literally spins forward or backward to operate. The spinner sits in the control booth, along with the audioperson, technical director, and, in the case of television, TV director. During the early years of TV, the spinner of a variety show typically operated two tapecaster machines that played eight-track tapes; two turntables and two open-reel machines patched to a mixing desk operated by the audioperson, who controlled the volume level for the microphones used by the hosts, and also had an eye out for the channel track assigned to the spinner. Except for the playback machines, which have been replaced by computers, and new functionalities that allow the hardware to connect wirelessly to each other, the design of the signal path has remained the same to this day. The spinner would cue one tapecaster machine to play laughter; the other tapecaster to play applause; and the turntables and open-reel machines to play music and other sound effects. A variety show would have many musical numbers, and it was the spinner&#x2019;s job to cue the tape that would play the minus-one musical accompaniment. For easier recall, sections of the reel would be marked with paper so the spinner only had to pause the &#x201C;forward&#x201D; button of the machine to that section of the reel. Scoring for a live TV program not only demanded tremendous technical expertise but also an impeccable sense of timing. It required one to be a technician with a well-developed musical ear. There is only one other field of endeavor in which both qualities are highly valued: radio broadcasting."

Defined as broadcasting beyond national borders, transnational broadcasting of Philippine origin began in the 1930s when radio stations aired both on longwave and shortwave bands. In the first, radio signals covered a limited area, with Manila-based stations reaching only the nearby provinces. The second allowed stations to relay signals not only to the Visayas and Mindanao but also to much of Asia, the United States, and ships at sea. Today a combination of technologies, including satellites and digital technology, has expanded transnational broadcasting of Philippine programming. Moreover, new broadcasting business models as well as the spread of diasporic Filipino audiences around the world have driven the creation of Filipino programming in many countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first model involves the overseas expansion of operation of local networks for the purpose of transmitting signals to target audiences abroad. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> and GMA, the two largest networks in the country, extended their operations by establishing The Filipino Channel (TFC) and GMA Pinoy TV, respectively. TFC, based in Redwood City, California, USA, delivers programming by broadcast, cable, pay-per-view, and online. It claims to have three million subscribers worldwide, located mostly in the United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East, Australia, and Japan. Launched in 1994, TFC airs mostly programs from ABS CBN as well as news and public affairs programs produced in the United States for Filipino-American audiences. Using the same model of program delivery is GMA Pinoy TV, launched in 2005, which broadcasts to the United States, Canada, Europe, Middle East, North Africa, Japan, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and the Pacific. TFC and GMA Pinoy TV both bring to worldwide audiences dramas, comedies, variety shows, musicals, talk shows and other programs made in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another mode of exporting Filipino programs is by selling franchises and specific shows to stations in other countries. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Lunchtime Peek-a-boo!), which airs locally on GMA Channel 7, is the most significant franchise to date, airing in Indonesia with Indonesian hosts. (See <b>Franchising</b>.) Dubbed in English or in the languages of the countries to which they are exported, <i>teleseryes</i>, on the other hand, are showing in international markets including countries in Asia and Africa. ABS-CBN teleseryes that gained a following abroad include <b><i>Pangako Sa &lsquo;Yo</i></b>, titled internationally as <b><i>The Promise,</i></b> which aired in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, and Africa in 2002. Another ABS CBN favorite, <b><i>Tayong Dalawa</i></b> (The Two of Us), aired in Singapore and Malaysia in 2010 and later in Brunei and Kenya. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1278\"><strong>Sana Maulit Muli</strong></a></i></b> (Can We Start Over Again) was later dubbed in Mandarin and aired in Taiwan in 2008 with the title <b><i>Chances</i></b>. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1461\"><strong>Lobo</strong></a> </i></b>(Werewolf) in 2008 was a fantasy-horror teleserye, aired in Brunei, in Vietnam, and other countries in Asia, Europe and Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The move towards digital broadcasting, backed by law, has significantly increased the use of live streaming of both radio and television signals, tremendously increasing the availability of Philippine programs online, which makes them accessible globally. With simpler technologies and requiring less bandwidth than television, radio stations have been aggressively simulcasting terrestrially and online, effectively transnationalizing most Philippine radio since the beginning of the 21st century. Nevertheless, the presence of growing Filipino populations in several countries has encouraged the establishment of land-based as well as online radio stations in the United States, Europe, and parts of Asia, especially where there are significant numbers of Filipino migrants and contract workers, ensuring the commercial viability of the broadcast operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> such station is TAG-FM, broadcasting on 91.1 MHz, the first Filipino format radio station in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Launched on 25 Mar 2013, TAG-FM is one of two stations owned by the Arabian Radio Network, the largest radio owner in Dubai with nine stations broadcasting in six languages (<b><i>The National</i></b> 2013; ARN 2013; <b><i>Khaleej Times</i></b> 2013). It broadcasts in Tagalog, hence the name. With an output power of between 12 and 15 kilowatts from its antenna located on the 68-storey Al Mas (Arabic for &ldquo;the Diamond&rdquo;) skyscraper, the centerpiece building of 79 towers in the larger Jumeirah Lake Towers development, TAG-FM&rsquo;s signal reaches the entire UAE landmass and the approximately 650,000 to 900,000 members of the Filipino community in the UAE (Commission on Filipinos Overseas 2012) as well as overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in neighboring countries near the borders who listen via a traditional radio receiver and throughout the Middle East who tune in via the station&rsquo;s web stream on the Internet and mobile applications. The on-air staff is recruited from the major broadcasting groups in Manila, including MBC (Manila Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>) and ABS CBN. In its first year of operation, TAG-FM won <b><i>Ahlan</i> <i>Magazine</i></b>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Best Radio Station&rdquo; award, with an overwhelming vote of over 50,000 from readers, a first in the magazine&rsquo;s history. The station airs mainly Original Pilipino Music (OPM) and news from the Gulf and from the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Australia, two radio groups air programs for Filipinos: the Filipino Broadcasting Group (FBG), which is part of 92.3 3ZZZ Ethnic Community Radio Station, and the Filipino Language Program under Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). Supported by the Australian government, they are part of Australia&rsquo;s program to strengthen its multicultural and multilingual society. FBG airs five programs every week, which include community and entertainment news and music. Filipino musical artists based in Australia are featured. Heard via broadcast and online, the FBG launched the first Cebuano-Tagalog-English show in Australia. The Filipino Language Program in SBS, on the other hand, broadcasting in Filipino, is part of an Australian government-funded public broadcasting in 78 languages.

Defined as broadcasting beyond national borders, transnational broadcasting of Philippine origin began in the 1930s when radio stations aired both on longwave and shortwave bands. In the first, radio signals covered a limited area, with Manila-based stations reaching only the nearby provinces. The second allowed stations to relay signals not only to the Visayas and Mindanao but also to much of Asia, the United States, and ships at sea. Today a combination of technologies, including satellites and digital technology, has expanded transnational broadcasting of Philippine programming. Moreover, new broadcasting business models as well as the spread of diasporic Filipino audiences around the world have driven the creation of Filipino programming in many countries."

The artistic component of videography consists of visual composition, camera movement, and the manipulation of light, both artificial and natural, to achieve a specific creative objective. The scientific component includes camera handling, lighting exposure, the use of recording devices, and the operation of other technical equipment used in capturing images such as a camera and lens, a camera control unit (CCU), lighting instruments, reflectors, gobos, and lens filters. These components are divided into the following functions: lighting direction or the design of the illumination of the set and the performers; technical direction or the control of the settings of the several cameras used in the production in order to balance their color temperature (white balance) for accurate color reproduction, match camera filter settings, and aperture openings for exposure; and, camera operation or the manipulation of the camera to compose the images and carry out camera movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The personnel in charge of videography for video and television productions vary according to program genre, production budget, and production needs. Usually, in productions with multi-camera setups, whether it airs live with real-time switching from one camera to another or pre-recorded and edited after the shoot, videography is usually divided among the following: the lighting director with the help of a gaffer and other lighting personnel for lighting direction; the technical director for the technical aspects of lighting; and the camera operators for camera handling. In productions with a single camera setup, the videographer sometimes takes on the role of the lighting director, technical director, and camera operator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In public affairs programs like the morning show <b><i>Unang Hirit</i></b> (First Strike), 1999, GMA, which has a multiple camera setup and airs live, the program director acts as the lighting director, giving instructions to lighting personnel and gaffers to execute the lighting effects he or she needs for the program. The program director also provides the camera operators with the coverage and camera angling he needs during the duration of the show. This kind of lighting is usually formulaic with the main objective of illuminating the set and the presenters and performers. In this kind of set up, a technical director assists the program director with the other elements of videography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For programs that have repetitive segments, like the game show <b><i>Kapamilya:</i> <i>Deal or No Deal</i> </b>(Of the Family: Deal or No Deal), 2006, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>, which is pre-recorded and has a multiple camera setup, a lighting director is hired for the initial shooting. The lighting crew simply replicates the original design in the taping of the succeeding episodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a pre-recorded program with a multiple camera setup like drama productions, a more creative kind of lighting is the convention. In these types of programs, a lighting director, usually a cinematographer from the film industry, with his lighting crew, is hired to design and execute the lighting requirements of the production. Malu L. Sevilla&rsquo;s fantasy drama <b><i>Juan de la Cruz</i></b>, 2013, ABS-CBN, was lit by George Tutanes and his crew. Tutanes&rsquo;s film credits include Carlos Siguion Reyna&rsquo;s <b><i>Kahapon May Dalawang Bata</i></b> (Yesterday Children), 2000, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4332\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\"><strong>Mel Chionglo</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Burlesk King</i></b>, 1999. Noted film cinematographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4734\"><strong>Romy Vitug</strong></a> handled the camera for some episodes of the music program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1400\"><strong>Aawitan Kita</strong></a></i></b> (I Will Sing for You), 1970-2006, aired on different channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News and public affairs programs, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1428\"><strong>The Correspondents</strong></a></i></b>, 1998, ABS-CBN, <b><i>Brigada Siete</i></b>, 1993, GMA, and <b><i>Probe Team Documentaries</i></b>, 2004, TV5, are examples of pre-recorded programs that usually use a single camera for image gathering. The coverage team in these kinds of programs is composed of a camera operator, audio person, production management team, and the producer/director/on-camera performer. In this setup, the camera person acts as the videographer, responsible for both the creative and technical aspect of the coverage. In some instances, the producer/director/on-camera talent would suggest a camera angle for the coverage. In low budget independent and alternative productions, usually for online broadcast, the videography is done by the producer/director: it usually is a one-person team. Recent documentaries, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1497\"><strong>Reel Time</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i>Front Row</i></b>, which both premiered in 2011 on GMA News TV Channel 11, have adopted some aspects of the cin&eacute;ma verit&eacute; tradition in capturing and framing images for the video camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the emergence and accessibility of new video technology with higher resolutions and the ability to capture images in low light conditions, techniques used in both the cinema and theater have been adopted by videographers allowing for more creativity in visual imaging as compared to the flatter/no-shadow lighting formula prior to these advancements in technology. The flatter lighting used in <b><i>Oras ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> </i></b>(Happy Hour), 1962, ABS-CBN, is very different from the depths of images seen in <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b>, 2009, ABS-CBN, where lighting for live concerts that use moving lighting instruments has become a standard for variety shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These technologies, like mobile phones with built-in cameras, have also enabled those outside the broadcast industries to create their own video works which are exhibited in online portals like YouTube and in mainstream broadcasts&rsquo; participatory segments, similar to &ldquo;Bayan Mo, Ipatrol Mo&rdquo; (Monitor Your Country), a segment of the news program <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, which premiered in 1987 over ABS-CBN. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byFernando A.

				"value": "<b>Videography</b> is the art and science of capturing moving images on television and similar electronic digital media, as opposed to<b> cinematography</b> where the images are imprinted on celluloid film. The artistic component of videography consists of visual composition, camera movement, and the manipulation of light, both artificial and natural, to achieve a specific creative objective. The scientific component includes camera handling, lighting exposure, the use of recording devices, and the operation of other technical equipment used in capturing images such as a camera and lens, a camera control unit (CCU), lighting instruments, reflectors, gobos, and lens filters. These components are divided into the following functions: lighting direction or the design of the illumination of the set and the performers; technical direction or the control of the settings of the several cameras used in the production in order to balance their color temperature (white balance) for accurate color reproduction, match camera filter settings, and aperture openings for exposure; and, camera operation or the manipulation of the camera to compose the images and carry out camera movements."

Usually, in productions with multi-camera setups, whether it airs live with real-time switching from one camera to another or pre-recorded and edited after the shoot, videography is usually divided among the following: the lighting director with the help of a gaffer and other lighting personnel for lighting direction; the technical director for the technical aspects of lighting; and the camera operators for camera handling. In productions with a single camera setup, the videographer sometimes takes on the role of the lighting director, technical director, and camera operator."

The program director also provides the camera operators with the coverage and camera angling he needs during the duration of the show. This kind of lighting is usually formulaic with the main objective of illuminating the set and the presenters and performers. In this kind of set up, a technical director assists the program director with the other elements of videography."

Malu L. Sevilla&#x2019;s fantasy drama <b><i>Juan de la Cruz</i></b>, 2013, ABS-CBN, was lit by George Tutanes and his crew.

The coverage team in these kinds of programs is composed of a camera operator, audio person, production management team, and the producer/director/on-camera performer. In this setup, the camera person acts as the videographer, responsible for both the creative and technical aspect of the coverage. In some instances, the producer/director/on-camera talent would suggest a camera angle for the coverage. In low budget independent and alternative productions, usually for online broadcast, the videography is done by the producer/director: it usually is a one-person team. Recent documentaries, such as <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1497\"><strong>Reel Time</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i>Front Row</i></b>, which both premiered in 2011 on GMA News TV Channel 11, have adopted some aspects of the cin&#xE9;ma verit&#xE9; tradition in capturing and framing images for the video camera."
