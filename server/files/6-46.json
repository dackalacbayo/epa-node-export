		"text": "<p>An <strong>aerobic dance</strong> is a complete physical workout that demands increasing oxygen consumption over an extended period of time. The continuous dance routine, like jogging, swimming, hiking, and other aerobic activities, improves and maintains the physiological functioning of the heart, lungs, and muscles. Dancing to popular music, participants walk, run, jump, skip, and stretch all throughout the workout which has three phases: 5 to 10 minutes warm-up exercises, 15 to 30 minutes aerobic dance routine, and 5 to 10 minutes cool down or limbering exercises.

		"text": "<p><strong>Atang-atang</strong> (offering) is an elaborate ceremony to heal the sick. The ceremony is performed by women healers or&nbsp;<em>mang-atang&nbsp;</em>with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chanting</a> and dancing. This custom is practiced in Cagayan Valley, particularly by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a>. A similar, and perhaps primordial, form of the atang-atang is the Ibanag&rsquo;s <strong>mawwari</strong>, performed by a&nbsp;<em>mangilu&nbsp;</em>(healer) at times when a family member&rsquo;s sickness is caused by a malevolent spirit. The mangilu traces the place where the&nbsp;<em>argamasingan&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>agirigira&nbsp;</em>(malevolent spirit) comes from. Cigars, candies, eggs, biscuits, and other red-colored offerings are placed on the selected spot. The ritual is accompanied by the beating of a&nbsp;<em>maganllag&nbsp;</em>or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>, which is tied around the waist of the healer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like the mawwari, the atang-atang is done when the illness is caused by angered spirits. But instead of a gong, Catholic prayers are chanted during the atang-atang. The elaborate ritual starts with the construction of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2095\">bamboo raft</a>. A white altar is built upon the raft and embellished with red and yellow paper cut-outs. The healers prepare offerings to appease the spirits: a white chicken, native eggs, coconut oil, rice, betel nut, rice cake, a white candle, and a three-day old chick whose leg is tied to the raft. The chick&rsquo;s crying symbolizes the sick person&rsquo;s voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mang-atang rubs oil on the sick person&rsquo;s face, neck, torso, and limbs. The blood from the neck of the sacrificial chicken is applied on the patient&rsquo;s face and body. The women healers dedicate the offerings with chanted prayers and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dancing</a>. As the mang-atang chants the Catholic prayers, ritualists freely move and sway arms in a fast and free manner that is contrapuntal to the slow rendition of the chanted prayer. Footwork is likewise unhampered by any counting, allowing the ritualist to turn or to move from place to place while dancing. The faces of the dancing mang-atang are expressionless and glassy-eyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The raft is carried to the river bank, where the sacrificial chicken is beheaded and thrown into the river. Its soul is expected to swim to the&nbsp;<em>encanto&nbsp;</em>or nature spirit that inflicted the illness. Thereafter, another sacrificial animal, such as a pig, is slaughtered. The mang-atang believes that its screams will get the attention of the supernatural beings and elicit their compassion. The pig&rsquo;s blood is collected in a container with oil and placed under the balete or ficus tree, which is believed to be the spirits&rsquo; dwelling place. Then the raft is released on the river, in the hope that it will reach the abode of the angry spirits.&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3090\">Rosalie S.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>balitaw</strong> is an extemporaneous exchange of love verses between a man and a woman. Danced and mimed, it is accompanied by a song, or the dancers themselves sing, improvising the steps and verses. It may last for hours, ending with the woman accepting or rejecting the man&rsquo;s suit. The balitaw is found mainly in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> and Visayan regions. The dancers may be costumed in&nbsp;<em>balintawak&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>patadyong&nbsp;</em>(tubular skirt) or in contemporary everyday clothes. Its accompaniment could be provided by a&nbsp;<em>subing&nbsp;</em>(bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/806\">castanets</a>, coconut <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/812\">harp</a>, five-stringed guitar, or a combination of the three. The Visayan balitaw is usually in the minor key, while the Tagalog is in the major. Both are related to the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\">kumintang</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">kundiman</a>&nbsp;</em>in their styles of accenting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As sung in quatrain or ballad stanza in the Visayas, it is extensive and sensual with accompaniment similar to the bolero, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/98\">Spanish dance</a> also in triple time, accompanied by the dancers&rsquo; singing and castanet playing. In words which may be humorous and full of energy, the typical Visayan balitaw speaks of all domestic phases of life, from love and courtship, marriage and separation, gambling and employment, child rearing, envious neighbors, to the dignity of labor. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> couple Pedro Alfarara and Nicolasa Caniban were acclaimed as the &ldquo;king and queen&rdquo; of the balitaw at the turn of the century.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> recorded three balitaw dances, all <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship dances</a>, with or without the singing.

		"text": "<p>A dance performed by the Applais tribe in Western Mountain Province, the <strong>ballangbang</strong> or <strong>tallibeng</strong> is a reenactment of a tribal war. The dancers mimic the movement of spies, bending forward as if to snoop on or hide from their enemies, then straightening their bodies and moving backward as if to protect themselves. The snooping and hiding is clearly seen in the entrance steps; for example, where dancers hop forward with upper bodies bending in the same direction, then quickly step back, with upper bodies returning to an erect position. There are also movements that seem to signify &ldquo;attack&rdquo;&mdash;dancers lunging to the right then alternating with the left, followed by three sliding steps made by the same foot. The whole time, male dancers beat on their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a> while female dancers either have their arms akimbo or stretched sideways, with elbows bent, hands in a fist, and thumbs pointing up.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballangbang is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dance</a> performed during weddings and before planting and harvesting seasons.

Ballet refers to a technique and style of dancing strictly based on a well-codified theatrical school of dance or&nbsp;<em>danse d&rsquo;ecole</em>. The word ballet comes from Latin&nbsp;<em>ballare&nbsp;</em>(to dance) and Italian&nbsp;<em>balletto</em>, the diminutive of&nbsp;<em>ballo&nbsp;</em>(dance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet evolved from the European court spectacles that combined verse and story, music and designs, mime and dance, to create an operatic or dramatic form. One of these spectacles arranged by the Italian Catherine de Medici, then Queen Mother of France, was the <em><strong>Ballet Comique de la Reine</strong></em>, 1581, which was considered the first ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The formation of the ballet&rsquo;s enduring academic base was achieved by the Academie Royale de la Danse in 1661 under the reign of Louis XIV, himself a dancer. The Academie codified the ballet technique and style to compose the danse d&rsquo;ecole. In the 1700s, the ballet was strengthened as a dramatic expression with the efforts of Franz Anton Christoph Hilverding and Gaspero Angiolini in Vienna, Jean Georges Noverre in Stuttgart and Vienna, Salvatore Vigano in Milan, Charles Didelot in St Petersburg, and Vincenzo Galeotti and Antoine Bournonville in Denmark. Their ballets stressed plot and character portrayal in the structures called <strong>ballet d&rsquo;action</strong>, choreodrama, and other realistic productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first half of the 1800s, a greater degree of stylization developed, with the introduction of dancing on pointe or the tips of the toes. The influence of the Romantic Movement produced acclaimed prima ballerinas like Marie Taglioni, Fanny Elssler, Carlotta Grisi, and Fanny Cerrito, and created fantastic roles in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operas</a> like <em><strong>Robert le Diable</strong></em>, 1831, or in ballets like <em><strong>La Sylphide</strong></em>, 1832, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><em><strong>Giselle</strong></em></a>, 1841.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet declined as an art form in Europe in the latter half of the 19th century. In Tsarist Russia, however, the Frenchman Marius Petipa and his collaborator Lev Ivanov staged numerous full-evening ballets that were to define ballet classicism as it is known today. Ballet masterpieces were choreographed to the music of Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, such as <em><strong>The Sleeping Beauty</strong></em>, 1890, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/199\"><em><strong>The Nutcracker</strong></em></a>, 1892, and <em><strong>Swan Lak</strong></em><em><strong>e</strong></em>, 1895, and other three- to four-act ballets to the music of court composers like Ludwig Minkus, Ricardo Drigo, and later, Alexander Glazounov.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 20th century, Michel Fokine, Vaslav Nijinsky, Leonide Massine, Bronislava Nijinska, and George Balanchine modified the ballet into the predominant one-act form produced by Serge Diaghilev for his Ballets Russes. They revivified the ballet in Europe with their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreographies</a> and their dancing, together with ballerinas like Mathilde Kchessinska, Anna Pavlova, and Tamara Karsavina. This influence was also felt with the contributions of Alexander Benois, Leon Bakst, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Giorgio di Chirico, in design; and Igor Stravinsky, Serge Prokofiev, Maurice Ravel, Manuel de Falla, and the French Les Six, in music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ballet in England and America gained greater following after the tours of Anna Pavlova, the Ballets Russes of Diaghilev, and later, of Colonel de Basil, and Rene Blum. After the 1917 revolution in Russia and the dispersal of the Ballets Russes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">companies</a>, many dancers and teachers spread throughout Europe, America, and Asia. Other than the first known English teacher Kay Williams, early ballet teachers in the Philippines in the 1920s and 1930s included Russians like Katrina Makarova who taught <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2503\">Anita Kane</a> in Manila, Mara Selheim who taught <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2584\">Fe Sala-Villarica</a> in Cebu, and briefly, Olga Dontsov, and Vladimir Bolsky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most influential was the Polish-Russian emigre <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2384\">Lubov &ldquo;Luva&rdquo; Adameit</a>. In her <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2430\">Cosmopolitan Ballet and Dancing School</a> established in 1927, Adameit taught, among others, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2449\">Remedios de Oteyza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2535\">Rosalia Merino-Santos</a>, who became the Philippines&rsquo; first homegrown dancers, teachers, and choreographers of note.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the earliest known visiting performers were the Australian Lilliputians with their little &ldquo;ballet girls,&rdquo; 1901, the Infantile company from Japan, and the dancers of the Baroufski Imperial Russian Circus, 1902. In 1915 and 1916, the mysterious Paul Nijinsky, who claimed descent from the imperial school in St Petersburg, performed in Manila. In 1922, Anna Pavlova and her company danced at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a> during one of two Asian tours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the prominent dancers, teachers, and choreographers descended from Kane, de Oteyza, Orosa-Goquingco, and Merino-Santos. Hungarian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2602\">Paul Szilard</a> and American <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2424\">Ricardo Cassell</a> were also very influential. Their small companies, such as the De Oteyza Ballet (later the Manila Ballet Company), the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2600\">Studio Dance Group</a>, the Anita Kane Ballet Company (later the Pamana Ballet),&nbsp;Ballet Theatre Philippines, and the folkloric <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2468\">Filipinescas Dance Company</a> produced dancers who would set up the first professional companies&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2486\">Hariraya Dance (later&nbsp;Ballet) Company</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2444\">Dance Theater Philippines</a>, both founded in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further reconstitution of these groups gradually led to the organization of the two major companies today, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Ballet Philippines</a> (not to be confused with the similarly named Ballet Philippines in the early 1960s) in 1970, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2554\">Philippine Ballet Theatre</a>&nbsp;in 1986, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2405\">Ballet Manila</a> in 1995. These three professional companies stage the most significant productions from the ballet classics to the contemporary works of foreign and Filipino choreographers in the Philippines and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable companies are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2440\">Dance Concert Company</a> founded in 1970, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2528\">Manila Metropolis Ballet</a> in 1978, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2484\">Quezon City Ballet</a> in 1988. Most groups and companies have studio-type schools, some internationally accredited. Two universities offer dance degree programs. Annual seasons and festivals sustain the professional life and the public following of this theatrical art. Some outstanding Filipino dancers, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2566\">Benjamin Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2568\">Josefa Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2590\">Tina Santos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2410\">Maniya Barredo</a>, have made their mark in companies, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musical</a> comedies, competitions, and festivals worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"modernballet\" name=\"modernballet\"></a>Modern Ballet</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modern ballet</strong> is a dance production of contemporary content but utilizing classical ballet technique and style. The movements may accommodate some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\">modern dance</a> devices and techniques, like contraction and release, fall and recovery, bound and rebound; they may also include natural rather than classical mime and reflect a contemporary tempo. It may, for instance, use pointe technique in an earthy and sharp manner rather than in the ethereal and fluent ideal of romantic ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern ballet dates from the Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev period (1909-29) and its influence in Europe. Isadora Duncan influenced Michel Fokine, and Kasyan Goleizovsky in Russia influenced George Balanchine and other choreographers. Vaslav Nijinsky (<em><strong>Afternoon of a Faune</strong></em>, 1912, <em><strong>Rite of Spring</strong></em> and <em><strong>Jeux</strong></em>, both 1913, and <em><strong>Til Eulenspiegel</strong></em>, 1916) and his sister Bronislava Nijinska (<em><strong>Les Noces</strong></em>, 1923, <em><strong>Les Biches</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Le Train Bleu</strong></em>, both 1924) also broke new ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also works that depicted the machine age, its automation and dehumanization. An example is Adolph Bolm&rsquo;s <em><strong>Iron Foundry</strong></em>, 1932, also known as <em><strong>Ballet Mechanique</strong></em>, set to Alexander Mossolov&rsquo;s percussive music. In 1939, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2453\">Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</a> also choreographed <em><strong>Iron Foundry</strong></em> in the Philippines. Her company, 1939-41, was called Manila Ballet Moderne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern ballet also deals with subjects relating to social conflicts, urban issues, and psychological anxieties. Examples of these are the various versions of Bela Bartok&rsquo;s <em><strong>The Miraculous Mandarin</strong></em> since 1926; the several versions of Soviet realism in <em><strong>The Red Poppy</strong></em>, 1927, and <em><strong>Golden Age</strong></em>, 1930; Kurt Jooss&rsquo;s <em><strong>The Green Table</strong></em>, 1932; Lew Christensen&rsquo;s <em><strong>Filling Station</strong></em>, 1938; Eugene Loring&rsquo;s <em><strong>Billy the Kid</strong></em>, 1938; Antony Tudor&rsquo;s <em><strong>Pillar of Fire</strong></em>, 1942; Agnes de Mille&rsquo;s <em><strong>Rodeo</strong></em>, 1942; Jerome Robbins&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>Fancy Free</strong></em>, 1944; Beijing&rsquo;s <em><strong>Red Detachment of Women</strong></em>, 1964; and Rudy van Dantzig&rsquo;s <em><strong>Monument for a Dead Boy</strong></em>, 1965. These ballets convey contemporary meanings, but should be distinguished from Martha Graham&rsquo;s style, with its Greek and American themes, or Twyla Tharp&rsquo;s way of tracing a story or commenting on styles in her elliptical, crisp, and quick method. Although the works of Graham and Tharp are also called ballets, they are properly modern dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other Philippine examples of modern ballet include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2432\">Eric Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2455\">Eddie Elejar</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>&rsquo;s respective treatments of the <em><strong>Carmen</strong></em> story in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/127\">1976</a>, 1980, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/128\">1984</a>; and the various interpretations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a>, in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2511\">Felicitas Layag-Radaic</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/167\"><em><strong>May Day Eve</strong></em></a>, 1971, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2524\">Lydia Madarang-Gaston</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/113\"><em><strong>Anak-Bulan</strong></em></a> (Moon Child), 1976, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio</a>&rsquo;s <em><strong>Agueda</strong></em>, 1991.

They not only deal with themes relevant to contemporary life but also employ modern theatrical staging devices. These ballets use Filipino or foreign contemporary music.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong><a id=\"operaballet\" name=\"operaballet\"></a>Opera Ballet</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Opera ballet</strong> is a dance within the context of an opera which may elucidate an idea or symbol, advance a plot, set a place in a vision or a festivity, or present a straightforward divertissement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ballet in operas became obligatory in France in the 1800s, so that even Richard Wagner had to add a bacchanal ballet in <em><strong>Tannhauser</strong></em> and Giuseppe Verdi in <em><strong>Il Trovatore</strong></em> and <em><strong>Othello</strong></em> when these were presented in France. When there is dancing in George Bizet&rsquo;s <em><strong>Carmen</strong></em>, the music is interpolated from his other works. Opera ballet may also mean the dancing ensemble permanently attached to most European opera houses, performing most of the dances in opera productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New York Metropolitan Opera choreographer Boris Romanoff says that contemporary productions stress dancing as part of the whole opera ensemble and in harmony with the overall style of the presentation. He explains the value of this fusion: &ldquo;The dance in opera must be expressive to the highest degree and in many instances it must be able to contain within itself the meaning and development of the action of the entire scene or act.&rdquo; Even when stylized, it must &ldquo;reflect the iconographic and architectural art of a given period&rdquo; (Romanoff 1949, 337-9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine opera productions have utilized the choreographies of Trudl Dubsky-Zipper, Remedios de Oteyza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2408\">Veda Ba&ntilde;ez</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2617\">Edna Vida</a>. As a special genre, the opera ballet spanned the late 1600s to the early 1700s, particularly in France. This genre ties singing and dancing together in a &ldquo;lyric theatre, more spectacular than dramatic&rdquo; (Harris 1977, 260-2). It is largely &ldquo;a combination of the Italian opera and the French court ballet&rdquo; (Wilson 1974, 368). A modern descendant of the opera ballet is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a> opera ballet which brought singing and dancing in equal balance to create a new musical theater in the 1970s. In the Philippines, a ballet company example was <em><strong>Tommy</strong></em> with music by The Who, choreographed in Canada by Fernand Nault in 1970, and in the Philippines by Alice Reyes in 1972. Another was <em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em>, with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice, which enjoyed several Philippine productions in 1972, choreographed by Amelia Apolinario, Alice Reyes, and many others after.

The Academie codified the ballet technique and style to compose the danse d&#x2019;ecole. In the 1700s, the ballet was strengthened as a dramatic expression with the efforts of Franz Anton Christoph Hilverding and Gaspero Angiolini in Vienna, Jean Georges Noverre in Stuttgart and Vienna, Salvatore Vigano in Milan, Charles Didelot in St Petersburg, and Vincenzo Galeotti and Antoine Bournonville in Denmark.

They revivified the ballet in Europe with their <a href=\"/6/47/26\">choreographies</a> and their dancing, together with ballerinas like Mathilde Kchessinska, Anna Pavlova, and Tamara Karsavina. This influence was also felt with the contributions of Alexander Benois, Leon Bakst, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Giorgio di Chirico, in design; and Igor Stravinsky, Serge Prokofiev, Maurice Ravel, Manuel de Falla, and the French Les Six, in music."

As a special genre, the opera ballet spanned the late 1600s to the early 1700s, particularly in France. This genre ties singing and dancing together in a &#x201C;lyric theatre, more spectacular than dramatic&#x201D; (Harris 1977, 260-2). It is largely &#x201C;a combination of the Italian opera and the French court ballet&#x201D; (Wilson 1974, 368). A modern descendant of the opera ballet is the <a href=\"/5/35/793\">rock</a> opera ballet which brought singing and dancing in equal balance to create a new musical theater in the 1970s. In the Philippines, a ballet company example was <em><strong>Tommy</strong></em> with music by The Who, choreographed in Canada by Fernand Nault in 1970, and in the Philippines by Alice Reyes in 1972. Another was <em><strong>Jesus Christ Superstar</strong></em>, with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice, which enjoyed several Philippine productions in 1972, choreographed by Amelia Apolinario, Alice Reyes, and many others after.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>balse</strong>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>valse&nbsp;</em>and the Viennese waltz (meaning &ldquo;to turn&rdquo;), is characterized by a series of continuous turning steps in closed ballroom-dance position to a musical accompaniment in fast 3/4 time. It was introduced and assimilated in the Philippines during the Spanish period. In Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a>, the balse is called the waltz step or turn performed as a step, close, step, in distinction to the folk waltz of the West which is a step, step, close. The waltz balance is a step, close, and a rise on the ball of the second foot, and a step in place of the first foot. The cross-waltz is a step across in front, a close, and step. Two folk dance steps&mdash;the <strong>sway-balance</strong> and the <strong>enga&ntilde;o</strong>&mdash;may end with a waltz as part of the combination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no precise information on the exact origin of the waltz. Castel-Blaze contends that the waltz is a direct descendant of the <strong>galliard</strong>. In <em><strong>Orchesographie</strong></em>, 1588, Thoinot Arbeau described the <strong>volta</strong>, a turning dance of Provence, which some believe is the mother of the waltz. Most dance authorities agree that the German <strong>deutcher</strong> (also called <strong>tedesco</strong>)&nbsp;and the Austrian <strong>landler</strong> are the more direct forerunners of the waltz.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After its ascent from its folk base, and despite strong prohibitions from moralists, the waltz conquered the dance floor. Prudes objected mainly to the close ballroom hold which was called an indecent embrace, the joyous exuberance which was considered wild, and the holding of the tail of the skirt close to the breast. All these were interpreted as scandalous behavior. The appeal of the waltz was such that the different countries evolved their own variations, with the Viennese waltz remaining supreme in style and execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When danced in ballroom style, the Philippine balse comes closest to a combination of the fast Viennese and the slower Boston waltzes. It has no set steps, sequences, or definite style, but is danced according to individual preference and skill. The waltz is included in at least 224 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documented</a> Philippine European-style dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few balse have been documented. The <strong>balse tagalog</strong> from Marikina is performed after a religious procession, the <strong>lutrina</strong>, which involves continuous praying with candles while walking with the image of a patron saint or crucifix. It is meant to alleviate pestilence or drought, and ends at the home of the&nbsp;<em>hermana mayor&nbsp;</em>or sponsor where the balse is performed amidst feasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>balse vieja</strong> or waltz of antiquity is from Pangasinan and is usually performed on important social occasions. The <strong>garambal</strong> is coined from &ldquo;gran&rdquo; (grand) and &ldquo;bal&rdquo; (balse), and is performed by two girls and one boy. Strangely enough, the dance does not include a waltz in its figures. The <strong>jotabal</strong> is a festival dance from Gumaca, Quezon, combining the rhythm of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota</strong></a> which is in 2/4 time and the balse in 3/4 time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>mazurka valse</strong>, also from Gumaca, features unique figures where the girl steps on the feet of the boy. They then proceed to do mincing step turns, walking steps, and lift the feet sideways right and left. Another mazurka valse is that from Kabankalan, Negros Occidental, danced in a closed ballroom position. Still another mazurka valse was previously danced in a long open formation. Today, it is danced in a circle, with waltzing in most of its figures.&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2480\">Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/3\">Hispanic Traditions and Transformations in Philippine Dance (1565 Onward)</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Fajardo, Libertad V. 1961, 1964, 1975. <em>Visayan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a>s </em>Vols I-III.

		"text": "<p><strong>Bati</strong>/<strong>sayaw na bati</strong> (dance of greeting) is a flag dance performed in Angono, Rizal as part of the religious <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> before and during the <em>salubong</em> which is the dramatized meeting of the Virgin Mary and the resurrected Christ on Easter Sunday. This annual dance has two main performers: the <em>tenyenta</em> (female lieutenant) and the <em>kapitana</em> (female captain). The dancing is deceptively simple but quite backbreaking if done without proper physical preparation. Bati dancers have a year to prepare for the religious event since the succeeding tenyenta and kapitana are chosen by lottery on the incumbent Easter Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kapitana and the tenyenta are not just trained to dance the bati and to recite the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poem</a> that goes with the ritual. They participate in the town&rsquo;s religious practices and initiate activities to uplift the morale of the community. They adhere to a code of conduct and are not allowed to marry or get pregnant during their official duty. Violations could mean being relieved of their valued positions. Moreover, the kapitana and the tenyenta must understand the sacredness of the flag. They must securely hold it throughout the procession and the performance. There is a folk belief that if the flag of the kapitana or the tenyenta falls on the ground, it may bring bad luck to the community in the form of fire, drought, floods, and other calamities.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The kapitana and the tenyenta are usually non-dancers who gain mastery of the dance during the intensive daily practice starting in Jan until before Holy Week. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> is said to have been created by Tandang Apang Gil, the teacher of the first known kapitana named Dominga &ldquo;Ingga&rdquo; Reyes in 1870. Other teachers who transmitted the dance were Candida Ner, aka &ldquo;Ti Canding,&rdquo; and the siblings, Primitivo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2622\">Marta Vitor</a>. The choreography consists of seven figures with distinct footwork, body movement, and gestures. Because the dance is regarded as sacred, the choreography is forbidden to be taught to anyone but the chosen kapitana and tenyenta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tenyenta and kapitana dance the bati during the <em>panaog</em>, a ritual performed on the evenings of Palm Sunday, Holy Wednesday, and Good Friday. But the most elaborate activities happen in early Easter Sunday during the salubong. Two processions come from separate locations. The first one originates from the church and carries the image of the Risen Christ, accompanied by the parish priest, kapitana, tenyenta, and council women. The second procession starts in a place called Poblacion Itaas and parades the images of Mary Mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Mary Salome, Saint Veronica, and Saint John. The two processions meet and converge at the <em>galilea</em>, a huge four-post structure made of bamboo with a wooden stage under it. The galilea is decorated with ornaments like flags, flowers, and coconut palm leaves. Above the stage hangs a curious construction shaped like a banana heart that represents heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The flag amplifies the graceful movements of the kapitana and the tenyenta. This prop is about 1 x 1.5 ft, inscribed with the word &ldquo;Alleluia.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">Band</a> music is used as accompaniment, such as those composed by Juan Petiza and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4162\">Lucio San Pedro</a>. As the band plays for the tenyenta, usually San Pedro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gavotte,&rdquo; the dancer starts the slow bending of the torso sideways from the waist. The bent torso leads the turning of the dancer either to the left or to the right, as if the whole body itself is a waving flag. When the tenyenta&rsquo;s dance ends, the kapitana recites a 20-minute <em>dicho</em> or poem of 31 stanzas.

The heart opens and reveals an angel, who now slowly descends with the joyful singing of &ldquo;Regina Coeli.&rdquo; The angel, played by a child, takes off the black veil that covers the image of the Virgin Mary to signify the end to her sorrow because Christ has risen. The kapitana then concludes her dicho with a joyful and energetic &ldquo;Alleluia, Viva!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Viva Resurreccion!&rdquo; The people applaud and caged doves are released with a burst of confetti. The kapitana then performs her flag dance with lively band music chosen by the kapitana&rsquo;s clan, such as the &ldquo;Balse&rdquo; composed by San Pedro. The kapitana&rsquo;s accompaniment is lively in contrast to the melancholy rhythm of the tenyenta&rsquo;s music. While the kapitana sways, the birds above also move in rhythm. Meanwhile, men who carry the religious images move the statues to the beat of the kapitana&rsquo;s dancing. People show appreciation for the kapitana&rsquo;s performance by throwing coins on the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tenyenta&rsquo;s and the kapitana&rsquo;s dances are similar in movements and postures. The marked difference is in arm and hand gestures, mood, and pacing since the tenyenta&rsquo;s performance mourns Jesus&rsquo;s death while the kapitana&rsquo;s dance celebrates Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. The two bati versions are characterized by the <strong>bali</strong> or <strong>kiling</strong>&mdash;the steep and sinuous bending of the torso from the waist on either side towards the back, rotating the whole body in an engaging swirl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both dances have seven figures according to seven combinations of footwork, each part ending with a turn. In the tenyenta&rsquo;s variant, the dancer holds the flag&rsquo;s base with the right hand at waist level and positions the flag&rsquo;s staff obliquely to the right across the chest and right arm, which allows the banner&rsquo;s fly to drape over the arm. The left hand rests either at the side or back of the waist, palms outward. These hand positions are maintained all throughout the dancing, except during the final bow. In the first figure, the dancer bends the torso sideward perpendicular from the upright position, continuing the movement by slowly turning clockwise in half or full pivot. The same is repeated in counter-clockwise direction. In the second figure, the dancer bends sideward left and maintains this body posture as she steps sideward left. Then she bends almost 180 degrees to the right and rotates clockwise. The whole sequence is then done in reverse, after which the dancer repeats the first figure in accordance with the melody of the band music. Since the hand and arm positions are set, the dancer may decide whether she wants to do a half, a full, or a double full turn. As the music ends with a flourish, the tenyenta waves the flag across to the left side of the body and in front with outstretched arms. Then she executes a full double turn clockwise, circling the flag in a spiral movement from chest level to overhead position and back to chest level. In another clockwise turn, the dancer sways the flag at the back and transfers it to the left hand, signaling her turn to the left in counter-clockwise motion. While doing this rotation, she transfers the flag to the opposite hand and turns to face the audience with a low curtsy in kneeling position, arms stretched out at shoulder level, and flag extending from the right hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kapitana&rsquo;s version of the flag dance uses hand and arm motions coordinated with the flag&rsquo;s swaying as she turns to either right or left direction. The signature posture is maintained in which the dancer is perpetually doing the bali or kiling. When the band music begins, the dancer bends sideward right to the lowest level, turns clockwise with outstretched arms, and presents the flag with the right hand. After this elaborate full turn, which may well be a double turn depending on the skill of the dancer, she may wave the flag behind and in front, while the left hand either sways or rests on the waist. Another combination consists of waving both arms in a figure of eight, in which limbs intersect in a cross-arm position in front of the body. The flag may be transferred from left to right while arms are crossed. Then this movement may be followed by a spiraling action of the banner over the dancer&rsquo;s head while turning in a bowed posture. Next, she holds the flag&rsquo;s staff parallel to the floor at chest level, turning in this position with left hand on the waist. Or, she may also hold the flag&rsquo;s staff on both ends parallel to floor at chest level while swaying the torso sinuously from side to side. She proceeds to circle the banner once or twice overhead, its fly barely touching her hair. The kapitana ends with a curtsy similar to the tenyenta&rsquo;s dance. The beauty of the kapitana&rsquo;s dancing is when the flag becomes an extension of the dancer&rsquo;s hand, which allows effortless swaying and transference of the flag from one hand to the other. It is important to look at the flag as it moves so that the head and neck are coordinated in the swirl. This technique adds fluidity and helps the dancer to gracefully sway and bend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The test of a good bati dancer is in her ability to bend lower and slower, seamlessly turning and never staying in a straight vertical posture. The exaggerated bending of the torso in a wavelike motion makes this dance unique. This is made possible with simple footwork that deftly transfers weight on to either the right or left foot, whichever is needed to allow the smooth pivot. At some point, the dancer may also use waltzing steps, depending on the music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, the dancers wore the traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\">baro&rsquo;t saya</a>. In the 2000s, the bati has become a spectacle with elaborate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume and stage design</a>. The kapitana and tenyenta don ornate ball gowns with butterfly sleeves to approximate the look of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\"><em>terno</em></a>. The terno&rsquo;s articulated skirt layered with petticoats underneath is meant to exaggerate the swirling movements. The color of the flag is the same as the color of the gown. However, the ball gown&rsquo;s enormous skirt may encumber the dancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bati is a thriving dance tradition in the first class-municipality of Angono, known as the Art Capital of the Philippines. To maintain this distinction, the preservation and sustainable innovation of traditional rituals such as the bati is important. A factor in sustainability is the awareness of local citizens about the importance and relevance of their cultural heritage. The tenyenta, kapitana, and their entourage are all young women who strive to learn the traditions and rituals for self-development and for community service. Objectionable revisions in the tradition are avoided with the drafting of the document titled &ldquo;Panuntunan ng Samahan ng Kapitana at Tenyenta&rdquo; (Guidelines of the Organization of the Kapitana and Tenyenta) in 2015. Moreover, the fact that Angono&rsquo;s band music is alive helps to ensure that the dance will be preserved for posterity.&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

They participate in the town&#x2019;s religious practices and initiate activities to uplift the morale of the community. They adhere to a code of conduct and are not allowed to marry or get pregnant during their official duty. Violations could mean being relieved of their valued positions. Moreover, the kapitana and the tenyenta must understand the sacredness of the flag. They must securely hold it throughout the procession and the performance. There is a folk belief that if the flag of the kapitana or the tenyenta falls on the ground, it may bring bad luck to the community in the form of fire, drought, floods, and other calamities."

The <a href=\"/6/47/26\">choreography</a> is said to have been created by Tandang Apang Gil, the teacher of the first known kapitana named Dominga &#x201C;Ingga&#x201D; Reyes in 1870. Other teachers who transmitted the dance were Candida Ner, aka &#x201C;Ti Canding,&#x201D; and the siblings, Primitivo and <a href=\"/6/6/2622\">Marta Vitor</a>. The choreography consists of seven figures with distinct footwork, body movement, and gestures. Because the dance is regarded as sacred, the choreography is forbidden to be taught to anyone but the chosen kapitana and tenyenta."

				"value": "The tenyenta and kapitana dance the bati during the <em>panaog</em>, a ritual performed on the evenings of Palm Sunday, Holy Wednesday, and Good Friday. But the most elaborate activities happen in early Easter Sunday during the salubong. Two processions come from separate locations. The first one originates from the church and carries the image of the Risen Christ, accompanied by the parish priest, kapitana, tenyenta, and council women. The second procession starts in a place called Poblacion Itaas and parades the images of Mary Mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene, Mary Salome, Saint Veronica, and Saint John. The two processions meet and converge at the <em>galilea</em>, a huge four-post structure made of bamboo with a wooden stage under it. The galilea is decorated with ornaments like flags, flowers, and coconut palm leaves. Above the stage hangs a curious construction shaped like a banana heart that represents heaven."

As the band plays for the tenyenta, usually San Pedro&#x2019;s &#x201C;Gavotte,&#x201D; the dancer starts the slow bending of the torso sideways from the waist. The bent torso leads the turning of the dancer either to the left or to the right, as if the whole body itself is a waving flag. When the tenyenta&#x2019;s dance ends, the kapitana recites a 20-minute <em>dicho</em> or poem of 31 stanzas. The dicho&#x2019;s rendition is accompanied with hand and arm gestures along with standing and kneeling stances, narrating the travails and triumphs of Mary in connection with her son&#x2019;s death and resurrection."

Traditionally, the bendiyan, which originated in Kabayan, Benguet, was a victory dance celebrating a successful headhunt or the tribe&rsquo;s triumph over their enemies. Nowadays, this dance is performed to celebrate a bountiful harvest or to honor Kabunian, the supreme being of the Ibaloy. It is also showcased during cultural shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The arm movements of the dance remind one of war-like stances. The <strong>salawasao</strong>, for instance, has &ldquo;both arms raised above the head like curved carabao horns, palms facing each other&hellip;arms [swaying], fingers [flipping]&hellip;every count&rdquo; (Taguba and Andin 1994, 25) and becomes a kind of posturing that declares how brave the warriors of the tribe are. The <strong>kinkiyan</strong> is a movement that is supposed to challenge the enemy as the &ldquo;right hand [is] tucked to chest level, left hand [is] extended forward, fingers [are] stretched, palms [are] facing [up].&rdquo; The <strong>inushongan</strong>, on the other hand, has &ldquo;both arms raised above the head level, a little forward, fingers pointing downward&hellip;fingers [flipping]&hellip;in every count&rdquo; to signify protection from the enemy, while the <strong>pinadjosan</strong> has &ldquo;both arms at the back closed to sides like wings, fingers stretched, palms facing upward&rdquo; to mimic how warriors transport the spoils of war back to their own community (Taguba and Andin 1994, 25).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bendiyan is a mass dance&mdash;everyone present could participate. But it is the <em>mambunong</em> or native priestess who leads it. At the start of the dance, the mambunong invokes all the spirits of the earth, sky, and underworld to provide her with the names of courageous headhunters, after which the <em>oro-ols</em> (young men with crowns of woven bamboo embellished with rooster feathers) dance the <strong>tchunga</strong>, another name for bendiyan, around the pig being sacrificed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A line of dancers, both male and female, enters and forms an inner and an outer circle moving counter to each other. At any moment during the dance, amidst the beating of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>, these dancers triumphantly cry out &ldquo;Oowa-ay&hellip;Oowa-ay,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Long Live&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mabuhay.&rdquo; A leadman calls out each step to be performed, much like a line dance leader would.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dancers wear traditional Benguet costumes when dancing the bendiyan.

To cover their bodies, wealthy men wear a <em>kulibao</em> (also <em>kulebaw</em>) or white blanket with dark blue border lines over each shoulder, and wrap an <em>akuval</em> or cloth around two-and-a-half meters long around their waist to cover their loins.

		"text": "<p><strong>Binabayani</strong> is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">war dance</a> performed only by male dancers among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> of Zambales. In the past, the dance was performed by an Aeta group when there were imminent threats from enemies. Binabayani was an ingenious way to select the best fighters among them in case the group needed to go into battle. Those who won over opponents in this war dance were considered to be competent combatants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The male dancers are clad in a <em>lubay</em>, or red loin cloth, tied around the waist or hip. The ends of the cloth hang loosely from one side. An instrumentalist deftly plays the local <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a> called <em>givaran bakil</em>, carved from local wood, with rhythmic beat of one and two to a measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The footwork has four variations. The first movement consists of small step hops: step right or step left and hop on the same foot while raising the other foot behind. This footwork is done in any direction with two-step hops to one measure. The second movement requires the dancer to hop with the right foot as the left foot taps forward. He may use only the heel or ball of the foot to hop, walk, or run. The third movement simply requires the dancer to execute small steps toward any direction. The fourth movement consists of two chasing steps to one measure: step left foot forward, sideward, or backward; then step the right foot behind close to left foot. The movement is then done in reverse order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In one version, this <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">martial dance</a> pits two contending male groups armed with a bolo and a circular shield. The dance ends when the two groups, at the height of intense fighting, exchange their bolos for the spear.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The binabayani may also be performed by two opponents armed with bows and arrows. The dueling warriors enter the space as soon as the guitarist starts strumming. Opponents sometimes beat their bow with an arrow like a percussive instrument as they appraise each other while moving to their fighting positions. Inside the combat arena, they rhythmically move in circular or oval formations through the step-and-hop footwork. They may advance and retreat but the circular formation is maintained as they continue to circle in clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. At one instance, a fighter may try to shoot and then change his mind, perhaps because he lost the precise position to execute a shot. The martial dance requires stamina and skill in order to sustain nonstop and frenetic footwork for the duration of the dance, which may be from 5 to 15 minutes. The best dancers step and hop continuously with lightness and agility, but at the point of perfect timing and position, they release the arrow to vanquish the opponent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Binabayani is one of the Aeta dances showcased in the tourism packages of the Subic Bay Freeport Zone. The show is a dance demonstration of less than three minutes, featuring two Aeta <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic dances</a> and the binabayani as the climax. Performers are young male dancers, a guitarist, and a tour guide who annotates the dances. The binabayani versions presented in these shows are terse and bland compared to the traditional style.&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

It mimics the <em>banog</em> or hawk, also thought of as eagle, and called &ldquo;bird of birds.&rdquo; It is one of several and similar <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/45\">hawk dances</a> in the country, which include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> <strong>banog-banog</strong>, the Higaonon <strong>binaylan</strong>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a> <strong>kinabua</strong>. The performance of Panay&rsquo;s binanog closely involves dancers and musicians as they jive together in <em>sunu</em> (or fitting in) or <em>hampang</em> (playing together). The audience uses <em>hiyaw</em> or <em>tata</em> to express approval, saying &ldquo;<em>Herli, herli, herlikita</em>&rdquo; (i.e., us). Both dancers and musicians must achieve <strong>sibod</strong> (matching sound and steps together).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic instruments that provide musical accompaniment are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\"><em>agung</em></a> (brass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>), <em>tambur</em> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a>), and <em>kahuy</em> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/821\">sticks</a>). They compose a <em>barasalun</em> ensemble. Other occasions may have the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\"><em>subing</em></a> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>), <em>litgit</em> (chordophone), <em>suganggang</em> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/805\">bamboo buzzer</a>) and <em>tikumbu</em> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/832\">zither</a>). A complete performance includes the playing of a bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a> and the <em>kubing</em> (native <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">lute</a>), said to be the favorite of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> heroes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\">Labaw Donggon</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1878\">Humadapnon</a>. The <em>boses</em> (music and movement) are cued by mnemonics or patterns of sound, or by a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chant</a>. <em>Sangkap</em> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costuming</a> requires embroidered (<em>panubok</em>) shirt, pants, and head-kerchief for men, and a blouse, <em>patadyong</em> (skirt), and <em>tapis</em> (overskirt) for women. Women also wear a <em>takurong</em> (veil) topped by a <em>pudong</em> or forehead band with coins, which is matched by her <em>binigkit</em> or necklace with coins and a round bell or silver <em>bao-bao</em> (turtle-like) pendant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roles are defined in <strong>dahunga</strong> where a man and a woman dance together, and <strong>tinagbak</strong> where only a woman dances. The dance figures progress from walking the <strong>bayhunan</strong> or <strong>lisyun-lisyun</strong>, to <strong>repasu</strong> that improvises with <strong>kaykay</strong> and <strong>isduyung</strong> steps, <strong>sadsad</strong> in a variety of accented steps, <strong>simbalud</strong> with dramatic arm movements, and the <strong>pinanyo</strong>. The last is like a game, with the woman trying to hook a man within her shawl or <em>panyo</em>. Prominent movements are the arm movements in simbalud and the use of a shawl to catch a man in pinanyo, both suggesting the flying hawk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The binanog is danced on a <em>tambi</em> or balcony of a house with bamboo floor.

They are usually performed during various tribal gatherings, such as celebrating a wedding, a new tribal pact, or thanksgiving for a good harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the highlands of the Cordillera Range, the dances of different ethnic groups typify the iconography of birds. Even as they dance with their feet close to the ground, the Cordillera dancers spread out their arms, move their feathered heads, and flourish blankets to imitate swirling or soaring birds. Most of the bird dances of the Cordillera depict courtship. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, the <strong>talip</strong> portrays both the swooping of a high-flying bird and a man pursuing an evasive woman. The same is seen in the <strong>uya-oy</strong>, with a couple&rsquo;s hands flapping up and down like wings. In Benguet, the <strong>tarektek</strong> imitates the movement of woodpeckers. A man shows off his agility by flaunting a prized blanket or by gong-playing (the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\"><em>gangsa</em></a>) to attract a woman. Again with wing-like blankets, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>&rsquo;s <strong>ballatan</strong> has a rooster swooping toward a hen that eludes him with her <strong>kalahig</strong> or scratching steps&mdash;until she gives in. A blanket is also a ready <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">prop</a> in Apayao&rsquo;s <strong>pingpingan</strong>, depicting a swallow in pursuit of his pair. For the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, the <strong>salip</strong> is the most noted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship dance</a> and has a rooster displaying his blanket-wings as he encircles a hen. Even in their head-hunting dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/63\"><strong>kayaw</strong></a>, the Kalinga run, hop, and leap like birds, using their spears and shields as wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cagayan, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a> imitate the small <em>klingkingan</em> birds living in caves, after which the dance <strong>klingkingan</strong> is named. To evoke the sounds that the birds make when flying, the dancers click Spanish or bamboo castanets. In Ilocos, to portray courtship, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> <strong>kalapati</strong> has two doves billing and cooing as a pair. With hands on waist, the dancers flap their elbows and peck at each other&rsquo;s faces over each other&rsquo;s shoulders. Similarly, the <strong>galyo</strong> in Pangasinan is another courtship dance, with a rooster in a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\"><em>barong</em></a> chasing a hen in a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\"><em>baro</em></a> and <em>serpentina saya</em> (skirt with train). At some point they subtly touch each other&rsquo;s elbows. Tayabas has <strong>pabo</strong> that mimics the strut of a turkey. Interestingly, it is portrayed by an odd person in a circle. The dancer tries to get a partner, and when successful, another person becomes the <em>pabo</em>. In Sorsogon, a <strong>pantomina mayor</strong> imitates the flirtation of rooster and hen as danced by a newly wedded couple. In the Visayan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/66\"><strong>kuracha</strong></a>, a couple dressed in a <em>barong</em> and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\"><em>balintawak</em></a> teasingly steps out like chickens or doves. The dance links them to nearby Samar&rsquo;s own <strong>kuracha</strong> and <strong>salampati</strong>. In the latter, a pair also portrays doves in courtship, looking back at each other while turning. Meanwhile, in Negros Occidental, the <strong>sinalampati</strong> portrays a mother dove tending to her chicks. Elbows, hands, and fingers are fluttered like wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Masbate, on the shore of Bantigue, people portray the <em>lapay</em> or seagulls by steeply leaning back as they slide-glide forward. In imitation of the hawk, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> of Panay dance the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/44\"><strong>binanog</strong></a> with the same leaning profile. Here the woman brandishes a shawl, with which she tries to hook the man. In Capiz, the <strong>tinolabong</strong> depicts the heron with its statuesque neck and legs. Like most realistic delineations in the lowlands, the dancer&rsquo;s articulated elbows depict wings, while hands represent beaks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Deemed a Visayan dance, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/60\"><strong>itik-itik</strong></a>, or duck&rsquo;s dance, was supposedly first seen by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> in Surigao. Agile singer-dancers improvised movements with &ldquo;short, choppy steps&rdquo; and pretended to &ldquo;splash water over their backs while calling to their mates&rdquo; (Reyes-Aquino 1953, 28). New <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">research</a> discovered another version in Sibunga, Cebu. Called <strong>itik-itik sibunga</strong>, it has the waddle and wiggle of the first itik-itik, but with different ways of moving arms and executing hops and foot-brushes. Leyte is famous for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a>. An early version, <strong>tinikling ha bayo</strong>, employs a pair of pestles to mark the rhythm. However, the modern tinikling has two bamboo poles struck in a <em>jota</em> rhythm. A couple imitates the rice-eating <em>tikling</em> birds, hopping in and out of the bamboo trap. Today, tinikling has become a signature Filipino dance. The tempo has accelerated while various complex formations have been devised to show off the dancers&rsquo; virtuosity and build up the dance to a rousing climax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some dances in Mindanao do not always literally imitate birds, but the surrounding aviary life that must have inspired their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costuming</a>, adornments, and movements. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> <strong>soten</strong> in Zamboanga, warriors frenetically move around while shaking ornate shields and palm leaves to make a boisterous sound. Similarly, in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dance</a> called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/92\"><strong>sagayan</strong></a>, warriors clash and leap about with wing-like scimitars and shields, wearing helmets topped by peacock-like plumes. Done before a combat, the dance is meant to bring the warriors to a trance or spiritual flight. Meanwhile, young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a> exuberantly run and leap about with their wing-like shields in the <strong>gin-um</strong>, as part of the water-cleansing <em>pamalugo</em> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> as they portray eagles flying against the wind. On the other hand, hawks are imitated in the <strong>kinabua</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, the <strong>man-manaok</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, and the <strong>banog-banog</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> and Higaonon. In the last, a <em>baylan</em> (shaman) portrays a hen protecting her chicks against a hawk that is finally killed by hunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, costuming amplifies the look of birds among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> and Blaan dances. <strong>Kadal tahaw</strong> imitates a variety of birds in the Tboli landscape. Dancers hang the <em>malong</em> (multicolored tubular skirt) from their shoulders, thrust their hands into the malong, and move these continuously in a number-eight pattern to create the illusion of flapping wings, as they execute step-and-hop movements, turns, and runs. They also create pleasing sounds with brass bells dangling from their girdles and brass <em>singkil</em> anklets. They depict the story of how a food-hunting bird injures its leg but still attempts to fly&mdash;indicated by the swooping movements of the malong, the flipping of wrists, and the dragging of one foot. Similarly requiring elaborate adornments, the Blaan <strong>kadal kafi</strong> in Lanao, Cotabato, and Saranggani imitates the crawl, strut, turn, and leap of the <em>kafi</em> bird, all executed with up-and-down movements of elbows and wrists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, there are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong></a> variants that imitate bird movements. The <strong>linggisan</strong> inscribes a woman&rsquo;s flowing postures and movements similar to a bird in flight. On the other hand, a man enacts a rooster in the <strong>pangasik</strong> with its mincing steps, shrugging shoulders, swaying arms, and cupped hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These examples of regional dances represent different modes and degrees of choreographic abstraction of bird movements, performed in response to various social functions, and even the demands of combat.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio Esteban S.

A man shows off his agility by flaunting a prized blanket or by gong-playing (the <a href=\"/5/37/810\"><em>gangsa</em></a>) to attract a woman. Again with wing-like blankets, the <a href=\"/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>&#x2019;s <strong>ballatan</strong> has a rooster swooping toward a hen that eludes him with her <strong>kalahig</strong> or scratching steps&#x2014;until she gives in. A blanket is also a ready <a href=\"/6/47/29\">prop</a> in Apayao&#x2019;s <strong>pingpingan</strong>, depicting a swallow in pursuit of his pair. For the <a href=\"/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, the <strong>salip</strong> is the most noted <a href=\"/6/46/49\">courtship dance</a> and has a rooster displaying his blanket-wings as he encircles a hen. Even in their head-hunting dance <a href=\"/6/46/63\"><strong>kayaw</strong></a>, the Kalinga run, hop, and leap like birds, using their spears and shields as wings."

To evoke the sounds that the birds make when flying, the dancers click Spanish or bamboo castanets. In Ilocos, to portray courtship, the <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> <strong>kalapati</strong> has two doves billing and cooing as a pair. With hands on waist, the dancers flap their elbows and peck at each other&#x2019;s faces over each other&#x2019;s shoulders. Similarly, the <strong>galyo</strong> in Pangasinan is another courtship dance, with a rooster in a <a href=\"/3/15/2098\"><em>barong</em></a> chasing a hen in a <a href=\"/3/15/2098\"><em>baro</em></a> and <em>serpentina saya</em> (skirt with train). At some point they subtly touch each other&#x2019;s elbows. Tayabas has <strong>pabo</strong> that mimics the strut of a turkey. Interestingly, it is portrayed by an odd person in a circle. The dancer tries to get a partner, and when successful, another person becomes the <em>pabo</em>. In Sorsogon, a <strong>pantomina mayor</strong> imitates the flirtation of rooster and hen as danced by a newly wedded couple. In the Visayan <a href=\"/6/46/66\"><strong>kuracha</strong></a>, a couple dressed in a <em>barong</em> and a <a href=\"/3/15/2098\"><em>balintawak</em></a> teasingly steps out like chickens or doves. The dance links them to nearby Samar&#x2019;s own <strong>kuracha</strong> and <strong>salampati</strong>. In the latter, a pair also portrays doves in courtship, looking back at each other while turning. Meanwhile, in Negros Occidental, the <strong>sinalampati</strong> portrays a mother dove tending to her chicks. Elbows, hands, and fingers are fluttered like wings."

Here the woman brandishes a shawl, with which she tries to hook the man. In Capiz, the <strong>tinolabong</strong> depicts the heron with its statuesque neck and legs.

Agile singer-dancers improvised movements with &#x201C;short, choppy steps&#x201D; and pretended to &#x201C;splash water over their backs while calling to their mates&#x201D; (Reyes-Aquino 1953, 28). New <a href=\"/6/47/32\">research</a> discovered another version in Sibunga, Cebu. Called <strong>itik-itik sibunga</strong>, it has the waddle and wiggle of the first itik-itik, but with different ways of moving arms and executing hops and foot-brushes. Leyte is famous for <a href=\"/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a>. An early version, <strong>tinikling ha bayo</strong>, employs a pair of pestles to mark the rhythm. However, the modern tinikling has two bamboo poles struck in a <em>jota</em> rhythm. A couple imitates the rice-eating <em>tikling</em> birds, hopping in and out of the bamboo trap. Today, tinikling has become a signature Filipino dance. The tempo has accelerated while various complex formations have been devised to show off the dancers&#x2019; virtuosity and build up the dance to a rousing climax."

Done before a combat, the dance is meant to bring the warriors to a trance or spiritual flight. Meanwhile, young <a href=\"/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a> exuberantly run and leap about with their wing-like shields in the <strong>gin-um</strong>, as part of the water-cleansing <em>pamalugo</em> <a href=\"/7/55/469\">ritual</a> as they portray eagles flying against the wind.

Dancers hang the <em>malong</em> (multicolored tubular skirt) from their shoulders, thrust their hands into the malong, and move these continuously in a number-eight pattern to create the illusion of flapping wings, as they execute step-and-hop movements, turns, and runs. They also create pleasing sounds with brass bells dangling from their girdles and brass <em>singkil</em> anklets. They depict the story of how a food-hunting bird injures its leg but still attempts to fly&#x2014;indicated by the swooping movements of the malong, the flipping of wrists, and the dragging of one foot. Similarly requiring elaborate adornments, the Blaan <strong>kadal kafi</strong> in Lanao, Cotabato, and Saranggani imitates the crawl, strut, turn, and leap of the <em>kafi</em> bird, all executed with up-and-down movements of elbows and wrists."

		"text": "<p><strong>Bodabil dance</strong> is the type of dancing in the variety show called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">bodabil</a>, consisting mainly of popular and theatrical dances from the United States, but later including Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a> and choreographies among its production numbers. Bodabil comes from the French <em>voix de ville&nbsp;</em>(street songs), or <em>chansons de vaux de vire&nbsp;</em>(topical or satirical drinking songs from Normandy), the latter supposedly created by a 15th-century literary society led by Oliver Bosselin. In the late 17th century, Nicolas Boileau (aka Despreaux) applied the term to some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballads</a>. In the 18th century, it became a theatrical term for performers of mime, song, and dance. It has also been called &ldquo;variety entertainment&rdquo; in the United States. In the Philippines, the show called <em>vod-a-vil</em> later became bodabil. During the Japanese occupation, bodabil with a melodrama was called stage show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vaudeville act is part of &ldquo;low comedy&rdquo; that requires &ldquo;precision, polish, timing, and many techniques, such as juggling, mime, ballad singing, dancing and acrobatics,&rdquo; and offers &ldquo;a satirical view of the life of the times in popular language, gesture and movement&rdquo; (Palmer 1978, 12). During the American colonial period from 1901 to 1946, vaudeville invaded the Philippines, and ultimately ousted the local musical or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><em>sarsuwela</em></a>. In the United States, it became current mainly through the Pastor family, especially through Tony Pastor, the &ldquo;father of American vaudeville.&rdquo; In the Philippines, John C. Cowper, who came with Harry Brown, was considered the &ldquo;dean of Philippine vaudeville.&rdquo; The new form was first seen in sarsuwela <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a> such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a> and Teatro Paz, and novelty houses such as the Savoy Nifties (later Clover), the Rivoli (later Tivoli), and Sirena (later Lux). Then, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">cinema</a> theaters housed the bodabil with its full extravaganza alongside the regular feature films. During the Japanese occupation, bodabil became the venue for the expression of Filipino sentiments, even as the Japanese banned American songs and dances. Incorporating the melodrama as its main attraction, bodabil became known as the stage show. Among the first dancers to perform in Manila bodabil at the turn of the century were Spanish dancers like Anita, Emilia, Teresa, Planella, Malfrosa Juan Panadei, Francisca Nabao (famous for her &ldquo;flea dance&rdquo;), the Agita Sisters (&ldquo;a clever Spanish trio&rdquo;), and the Frezagonda Sisters. They performed alongside American minstrels and clog, buck-and-wing, and skirt dancers. Billed as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s greatest dancer&rdquo; was Ada Delroy who played She in <em><strong>The Fire of Life</strong></em>, and was one of hundreds who were influenced by the pyrotechnical lights-and-skirt dancing of the legendary Louie Fuller, a contemporary of Isadora Duncan. Emily Lucifer, a popular child dancer, staged several benefits before she finally left the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of groups in the international vaudeville circuit performed in the Philippines: the Lilliputians in 1901 with their &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> girls;&rdquo; the Japanese Infantile <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">company</a> with its &ldquo;Japanese ballet;&rdquo; the Baroufski Imperial Russian Circus in 1902; the Denishawn Company of Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn in 1926; Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin and Far Eastern Entertainment with its &ldquo;Fil-American Variety Show&rdquo; in 1948; Katherine Dunham&rsquo;s company in 1957; and the Spanish maestro Luisillo in 1962.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1930s and 1940s, the most notable of visiting artists were Richard and Raymond Reynolds who were billed as Brothers and who taught their Filipino counterparts the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/104\">tap dance</a> and charleston; Helen and Lucy Martin; Anita Fiori from Budapest; and Jose Zarah, who stayed on after his troupe left. A Portuguese, Zarah spent World War II as a member of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a>&rsquo;s Merrymakers at the Dalisay, Strand, and Palace. After the war, he performed at the Clover which, with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Opera House</a>, was the foremost bodabil theater. His local partner for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/98\">Spanish dance</a> was the famous Bebe Marcaida. Charito &ldquo;Chuchi&rdquo; Hernandez became a noted choreographer at the Clover, especially between 1953 and 1963. She had risen from chorus girl to performer of character and national dances, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a>, and tap. Filipino bodabil artists soon came into their own, especially after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">jazz</a> pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3911\">Lou Borromeo</a> returned from the United States. In the early years of this century, Sunday Reantaso founded the first Philippine Vaudeville Company. In the shows, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a> became the &ldquo;queen of jazz&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Carmen Miranda of the Philippines,&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a> the &ldquo;queen of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><em>kundiman</em></a>.&rdquo; Early bodabil stars include the Garcia sisters, Flo and Modesta, who were trained by tap and jazz dancer Buster Dunson. As a trio, they were &ldquo;the three-cornered combination [that was] the best dancing act Manila ever had.&rdquo; There were also Pacita and Esthering, and Vitang Escobar. Carmen &ldquo;Miami&rdquo; Salvador was famous for her &ldquo;hula wiggle&rdquo; and for being a member of the Salvador family, his brother Lou Sr being the &ldquo;master showman&rdquo; of the day. An early observer wrote: &ldquo;There is a dainty nymph-like grace and beauty about those tiny Malay figures possessed by no other race in the world. They are quick to learn their routine, and are natural dancers&rdquo; (Maynard 1929, 306-7). Noted choreographers who started in bodabil were Bobby Salvador, Jake Jacinto, Nieves Manuel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2391\">Jamin Alcoriza</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2563\">Al Quinn</a>. Dancers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2588\">Lucio Sandoval</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2591\">Shirley Santos</a> staged their own dances in the 1950s when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4151\">Conching Rosal</a> sang with Bert Alpuerto at the Opera House. Other noted dancers were Paquito Bolero and Angelita &ldquo;Rhumba&rdquo; Rey; the Rusca Brothers called &ldquo;tap dancing wizards;&rdquo; Dandy, the &ldquo;tap dancing expert&rdquo; who became the comedian Casmot; Millie Sparks, later called Lopita; Rosa Aguirre and Metring David. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4784\">Chichay</a> and Patsy both started as chorus girls. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4333\">Chiquito</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4414\">Dolphy</a> were remarkable dancers, too. Casimiro and Nieves Manuel had a famous partnership and were billed the &ldquo;Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of the Philippines.&rdquo; Casimiro&rsquo;s comedy team with Jose Cris Soto made them the &ldquo;Laurel and Hardy of the Philippines.&rdquo; Later dance stars were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4744\">Ramon Zamora</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4275\">Jun Aristorenas</a> who later became action stars, Shirley Santos, Marie Cui, Arturo Zamora, and Dinky de la Cruz, who were mostly members of Alcoriza and Quinn&rsquo;s Modernaires. Bodabil was at its height at the time of the cakewalk, one-step, fox-trot, tango, charleston, and big apple, as well as the Latin rhumba, samba, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/66\">curracha</a> of the 1940s, the conga, pachanga, apalachicola, calypso, and charranga, and the post-World War II mambo, bossa nova, and cha-cha. Philippine folk dances were also performed by Lucio Sandoval and Patria Panajon or Aida Gonzales, or arranged by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2413\">Paz Cielo Angeles-Belmonte</a>. The era also witnessed the popularity of tap, soft-shoe, can-can, apache, and adagio dancing. Bodabil or stage show began to decline in the 1950s, when theaters like the Inday and Art featured burlesque dancing in <em>haba-haba</em> shows, an unsavory term for bodabil. Among the burlesque dancers were Virgie Night, Betty Co, Nina White, Jenny Moh, and Carlotta. In the 1970s, burlesque dancing drew male audiences to the Dragon and Playboy theaters. From the 1960s on, television threatened the stage show and even the movie theaters. Attempts in the 1960s to revive legitimate bodabil on stage came to naught despite the efforts of choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a>. Her father, Jose Generoso, was a noted producer-director for the bodabil. The stage show continued to be popular as entertainment in provincial fiestas and was resurrected in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1372\">variety shows</a> on television or radio, which absorbed many of the old bodabil artists.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio Esteban S.

				"value": "The vaudeville act is part of &#x201C;low comedy&#x201D; that requires &#x201C;precision, polish, timing, and many techniques, such as juggling, mime, ballad singing, dancing and acrobatics,&#x201D; and offers &#x201C;a satirical view of the life of the times in popular language, gesture and movement&#x201D; (Palmer 1978, 12). During the American colonial period from 1901 to 1946, vaudeville invaded the Philippines, and ultimately ousted the local musical or <a href=\"/7/55/472\"><em>sarsuwela</em></a>. In the United States, it became current mainly through the Pastor family, especially through Tony Pastor, the &#x201C;father of American vaudeville.&#x201D; In the Philippines, John C. Cowper, who came with Harry Brown, was considered the &#x201C;dean of Philippine vaudeville.&#x201D; The new form was first seen in sarsuwela <a href=\"/2/5/247\">theaters</a> such as the <a href=\"/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a> and Teatro Paz, and novelty houses such as the Savoy Nifties (later Clover), the Rivoli (later Tivoli), and Sirena (later Lux). Then, <a href=\"/2/5/245\">cinema</a> theaters housed the bodabil with its full extravaganza alongside the regular feature films. During the Japanese occupation, bodabil became the venue for the expression of Filipino sentiments, even as the Japanese banned American songs and dances. Incorporating the melodrama as its main attraction, bodabil became known as the stage show. Among the first dancers to perform in Manila bodabil at the turn of the century were Spanish dancers like Anita, Emilia, Teresa, Planella, Malfrosa Juan Panadei, Francisca Nabao (famous for her &#x201C;flea dance&#x201D;), the Agita Sisters (&#x201C;a clever Spanish trio&#x201D;), and the Frezagonda Sisters. They performed alongside American minstrels and clog, buck-and-wing, and skirt dancers. Billed as &#x201C;the world&#x2019;s greatest dancer&#x201D; was Ada Delroy who played She in <em><strong>The Fire of Life</strong></em>, and was one of hundreds who were influenced by the pyrotechnical lights-and-skirt dancing of the legendary Louie Fuller, a contemporary of Isadora Duncan. Emily Lucifer, a popular child dancer, staged several benefits before she finally left the country."

A Portuguese, Zarah spent World War II as a member of <a href=\"/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a>&#x2019;s Merrymakers at the Dalisay, Strand, and Palace. After the war, he performed at the Clover which, with the <a href=\"/7/60/3076\">Opera House</a>, was the foremost bodabil theater. His local partner for <a href=\"/6/46/98\">Spanish dance</a> was the famous Bebe Marcaida. Charito &#x201C;Chuchi&#x201D; Hernandez became a noted choreographer at the Clover, especially between 1953 and 1963. She had risen from chorus girl to performer of character and national dances, <a href=\"/6/46/61\">jazz</a>, and tap. Filipino bodabil artists soon came into their own, especially after <a href=\"/5/35/779\">jazz</a> pianist <a href=\"/5/5/3911\">Lou Borromeo</a> returned from the United States. In the early years of this century, Sunday Reantaso founded the first Philippine Vaudeville Company. In the shows, <a href=\"/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a> became the &#x201C;queen of jazz&#x201D; and the &#x201C;Carmen Miranda of the Philippines,&#x201D; and <a href=\"/7/7/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a> the &#x201C;queen of the <a href=\"/5/35/782\"><em>kundiman</em></a>.&#x201D; Early bodabil stars include the Garcia sisters, Flo and Modesta, who were trained by tap and jazz dancer Buster Dunson. As a trio, they were &#x201C;the three-cornered combination [that was] the best dancing act Manila ever had.&#x201D; There were also Pacita and Esthering, and Vitang Escobar. Carmen &#x201C;Miami&#x201D; Salvador was famous for her &#x201C;hula wiggle&#x201D; and for being a member of the Salvador family, his brother Lou Sr being the &#x201C;master showman&#x201D; of the day. An early observer wrote: &#x201C;There is a dainty nymph-like grace and beauty about those tiny Malay figures possessed by no other race in the world. They are quick to learn their routine, and are natural dancers&#x201D; (Maynard 1929, 306-7). Noted choreographers who started in bodabil were Bobby Salvador, Jake Jacinto, Nieves Manuel, <a href=\"/6/6/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a>, <a href=\"/6/6/2391\">Jamin Alcoriza</a>, and <a href=\"/6/6/2563\">Al Quinn</a>. Dancers <a href=\"/6/6/2588\">Lucio Sandoval</a> and <a href=\"/6/6/2591\">Shirley Santos</a> staged their own dances in the 1950s when <a href=\"/5/5/4151\">Conching Rosal</a> sang with Bert Alpuerto at the Opera House. Other noted dancers were Paquito Bolero and Angelita &#x201C;Rhumba&#x201D; Rey; the Rusca Brothers called &#x201C;tap dancing wizards;&#x201D; Dandy, the &#x201C;tap dancing expert&#x201D; who became the comedian Casmot; Millie Sparks, later called Lopita; Rosa Aguirre and Metring David. <a href=\"/8/8/4784\">Chichay</a> and Patsy both started as chorus girls. <a href=\"/4/4/4333\">Chiquito</a> and <a href=\"/4/4/4414\">Dolphy</a> were remarkable dancers, too. Casimiro and Nieves Manuel had a famous partnership and were billed the &#x201C;Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers of the Philippines.&#x201D; Casimiro&#x2019;s comedy team with Jose Cris Soto made them the &#x201C;Laurel and Hardy of the Philippines.&#x201D; Later dance stars were <a href=\"/4/4/4744\">Ramon Zamora</a> and <a href=\"/4/4/4275\">Jun Aristorenas</a> who later became action stars, Shirley Santos, Marie Cui, Arturo Zamora, and Dinky de la Cruz, who were mostly members of Alcoriza and Quinn&#x2019;s Modernaires. Bodabil was at its height at the time of the cakewalk, one-step, fox-trot, tango, charleston, and big apple, as well as the Latin rhumba, samba, and <a href=\"/6/46/66\">curracha</a> of the 1940s, the conga, pachanga, apalachicola, calypso, and charranga, and the post-World War II mambo, bossa nova, and cha-cha. Philippine folk dances were also performed by Lucio Sandoval and Patria Panajon or Aida Gonzales, or arranged by <a href=\"/6/6/2413\">Paz Cielo Angeles-Belmonte</a>. The era also witnessed the popularity of tap, soft-shoe, can-can, apache, and adagio dancing. Bodabil or stage show began to decline in the 1950s, when theaters like the Inday and Art featured burlesque dancing in <em>haba-haba</em> shows, an unsavory term for bodabil. Among the burlesque dancers were Virgie Night, Betty Co, Nina White, Jenny Moh, and Carlotta. In the 1970s, burlesque dancing drew male audiences to the Dragon and Playboy theaters. From the 1960s on, television threatened the stage show and even the movie theaters. Attempts in the 1960s to revive legitimate bodabil on stage came to naught despite the efforts of choreographer <a href=\"/6/6/2480\">Corazon Generoso-I&#xF1;igo</a>. Her father, Jose Generoso, was a noted producer-director for the bodabil. The stage show continued to be popular as entertainment in provincial fiestas and was resurrected in the <a href=\"/8/64/1372\">variety shows</a> on television or radio, which absorbed many of the old bodabil artists.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span></strong>"

The dance addresses the <em>kanagkilawan</em> (pantheon), which include the <em>ginoo</em> (gods), <em>mitibug</em> (spirits), and <em>getautelunan</em> (demons). According to the <em>timuay</em> or spiritual leader (now called <em>datu</em>) Agdina Bacong Andus, the Subanon hold the buklog for communal and personal reasons: to heal the sick through <em>panaad</em> (vow), to be rid of <em>gangan</em> or <em>dimalas</em> (ill fortune), to ask for blessings, and to release the dead so that they may float up to <em>langit</em> (sky) to join <em>magbabaya</em> or <em>ginoo</em>. The latter is in imitation of the Subanon hero Sandayo who, in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1940\"><em><strong>Keg Sumba neg Sandayo</strong></em></a> (The Tale of Sandayo), rose to heaven with his people.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the buklog, the following <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> are performed: the <em>dulang</em> to ask for permission to cut the trees, the <em>gampang</em> to provide offerings, and the <em>gatud</em> to drive away evil spirits. The buklog <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">stage</a> is built just for this special occasion.

		"text": "<p><strong>Cheerdance</strong> is an energetic and highly athletic form of dance characterized by sharp and snappy movements combined with tumbling and aerial stunts. It is a relatively new dance form popularized in the Philippines by the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) cheerdance competition in the mid-1990s. With more than 22,000 spectators watching the event in 2014, the UAAP cheerdance competition is considered one of the most anticipated sports events in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheerdance in the country can trace its roots to the American sport of cheerleading, an aesthetic sport which includes elements of dance, gymnastics, cheer, group stunts, and pyramids. It started as an all-male sideline event with the purpose of boosting school spirit among spectators and their respective teams. It was introduced to the Philippines through the American educational institutions in the early 1940s. Similar to a cheerleading routine, each cheerdance piece is short and lasts for about 2:15 to 2:30 minutes only. Compulsory elements include double pirouettes, high kicks, front or side splits, jumps, and leaps, performed by all team members either in unison or in succession. In both jumps and leaps, all team members must show the same routine during execution. Pompoms must also be used continuously by all participants for at least one third of the routine time. In the cheerdance category, cheers, chants, stunts, tumbling, pyramids, and acrobatics are prohibited.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheerdance, as popularized by the UAAP, however, has evolved into a form of its own. While the Filipino form of cheerdance still includes all the elements of American cheerleading, it is also thematic and longer in routine. Performance can be as short as five minutes to as long as 20 minutes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">Props</a>, which are usually prohibited by international standards, may be incorporated into the routine. For example, umbrellas, toy swords, and jump ropes have been used in the UAAP competition. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">Folk dance</a> steps have also been incorporated in some routines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mid-1990s, teams started to explore the use of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">space</a>, creative <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">movements</a>, props, and themes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">Costumes</a> also moved away from the traditional skirt and jersey in order to complement the theme of the routines. School teams which had gymnastics programs or resources to hire international cheerleading coaches were able to execute standard cheer stunts and pyramids while other teams resorted to creativity in showing the required elements. Two UAAP teams with strong dance backgrounds, the University of the Philippines Varsity Pep Squad (UP Pep Squad) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2611\">University of Santo Tomas Salinggawi Dance Troupe</a> (UST Salinggawi), dominated the competition until the mid-2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Cheerleading Philippines Federation or Cheerleading Philippines, the government-recognized national organization of cheerleading in the country, was established in the early 1990s, the training of local coaches in safe and proper stunts and pyramid techniques was scarce until the National Cheerleading Championships Incorporated (NCC) was formed in 2004. The success of NCC&rsquo;s summer camps facilitated by American cheerleaders resulted in a renewed drive in the programs of Cheerleading Philippines. The organization became more aggressive in promoting cheerleading and its various categories, including cheerdance, in the country. As a result, a number of Filipino coaches received international training and now hold international coaching and judging certifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2014 UAAP competition, each five minute long routine required cheer, stunts, tosses, pyramids, tumbling, and dance. Judging is divided into two parts: cheerleading and dance (overall effect including energy and dynamism, costume, and music), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> (creativity and musicality, difficulty, format, and transitions), technique (execution of style and clarity of movement, placement, control, extension, and strength of movement), and group execution (synchronization and spacing). Traditional cheer moves characterized by sharp and powerful arm movements are essential components. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/99\">Street dance</a> techniques like locks and pops are also used. Other dance forms include folk dance such as <strong>malong dance</strong> by the University of the East (UE) in 2014 and the <strong>sakuting</strong> by UP in 2001; martial arts like capoeira by UP in 2006 and tai chi by the Far Eastern University (FEU) in 2014; sports exemplified by synchronized swimming by UP in 2001, boxing by De La Salle University (DLSU) in 2013, and aerobics by UP and FEU in early 2000. Cheerdance groups utilized various props like hoops and jump ropes by UP in 2002; flags and ribbons by UST and fans and umbrellas by UE, both in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cheerleading competitions have also become popular outside of Metro Manila. However, as many cheerleading coaches are untrained, stunts, tosses, and pyramids are usually restricted or totally eliminated from the criteria. At present, there are four major cheerleading competitions in the Philippines. These are the UAAP Cheer Dance Competition, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Cheer Dance Competition, the NCC, and the Philippine National Games (PNG). The UAAP and NCAA competitions are partially accredited by NCC, while PNG is certified by Cheerleading Philippines. The NCC judges the technical aspects of the routine, which include difficulty and execution of tumbling, jumps, stunts, pyramids, and tosses. The UAAP competition committee also invites dance experts to judge the dance and artistic quality of each routine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the NCC and PNG follow international rules and regulations for cheerleading, the UAAP and NCAA competitions have two criteria or components: dance and cheerleading. These two serve as blueprint for understanding cheerdance in the Philippines, which has evolved into something more dramatic with the adoption of themes and social advocacy. For instance, in 2014 the UP Pep Squad broke tradition by delivering the message of equality. In a typical cheerleading performance, male cheerleaders act as bases and provide solid foundation for stunts and pyramids, and they lift or toss their female teammates up in the air. This somehow reinforces public perception that men are heavier and stronger while women are lighter and more flexible. The UP Pep Squad challenged this notion and advanced its advocacy by performing stunts and pyramids with female cheerleaders acting as bases and male cheerleaders as flyers. The cheer lyrics further emphasized the message of the routine. UP&rsquo;s performance stimulated discussion on social media for weeks even if the group failed to win the championship title.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Jonathan Y.

It started as an all-male sideline event with the purpose of boosting school spirit among spectators and their respective teams. It was introduced to the Philippines through the American educational institutions in the early 1940s. Similar to a cheerleading routine, each cheerdance piece is short and lasts for about 2:15 to 2:30 minutes only. Compulsory elements include double pirouettes, high kicks, front or side splits, jumps, and leaps, performed by all team members either in unison or in succession. In both jumps and leaps, all team members must show the same routine during execution. Pompoms must also be used continuously by all participants for at least one third of the routine time. In the cheerdance category, cheers, chants, stunts, tumbling, pyramids, and acrobatics are prohibited."

Courtship dances are usually performed during special occasions. <strong>Wedding dances</strong> are performed by newlyweds to formalize before the community members the new relationships that have been forged by the couple, their families, and relatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are hundreds of courtship dances in the Philippines. The very young can begin with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/57\">game dances</a>, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>igal ha panyuh</strong></a>. European-inspired <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">social dances</a>, such as the indigenized minute <strong>alcamfor</strong> from Leyte and the <strong>habasinan</strong> in Pangasinan, can also be vehicles for courtship. The exhibitionistic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/66\"><strong>kuratsa</strong></a> in Ilocos, Bicol, and the Visayas can start with playful male-female contests and end in mutual understanding. Even a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">combat dance</a> among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> which is done at weddings, the dance rivalry over a widow among the Talaingod, and the rivalry over a man among the Matigsalug, are dances of courtship.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>apas-apas</strong> (going after) at a <em>belasyon</em> (novena at a wake) in Antique is a courtship dance, as are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> and Visayan varieties of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a> that feature a song and dance debate between males and females. The Samar <strong>ismayling</strong> (from English, smiling) and the <strong>sampaguita</strong> from Cebu are similar to the balitaw. The <strong>cari&ntilde;osa</strong> features the devious yet obvious devices of a fan and a handkerchief for a play of hide-and-seek in many of its figures. These devices are also used in the <strong>pag-aring</strong> in Samar. A pair of earrings is used in the <strong>putrillo</strong> of Leyte, a Chinese saucer in the <strong>pinggan-pinggan</strong> of Bohol, and the sampaguita in the <strong>an marol</strong> of Samar. The <strong>like</strong> (coquetry) in Negros and Antique may go beyond the man&rsquo;s pleading to the woman&rsquo;s lifting of her skirt. The man may play-act, looking dejected with an elbow on a knee and propping up his drooped head on a spurned hand as in the <strong>maramyon</strong> in Leyte, and the <strong>voluntario</strong> in Iloilo and Antique which is about guerrillas during the Spanish colonial era, or the <strong>lingawen</strong> in Samar, which is similarly about a subversive who goes off to the mountains. The man may pretend to be dying in the Abra <strong>biniganbigat</strong>. Instead of the usual pair, two girls and a boy perform the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> <strong>la berde</strong>, a courtship and wedding dance. A woman may &ldquo;resist&rdquo; by putting up her palms, shading her face, or by mimicking a clam in the <strong>gumanhap</strong> of Cebu. She may play <em>hele-hele</em> (coy), as in a dance so named or in the <strong>saguin-saguin</strong> of Albay. Another Visayan courtship dance is the <strong>miligoy</strong> performed by a couple, usually at weddings, baptisms, and fiestas. The man may brag about his strength with &ldquo;seven spears and eight bolos&rdquo; in the <strong>inday na kunday</strong> in Leyte, to which the woman replies that only God is really powerful. On the other hand, a woman may be so distraught over a man&rsquo;s relentless pursuit as to stab herself in the <strong>punyal ni Rosa</strong> (Rosa&rsquo;s dagger) in Laguna. Love can be sad, as in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> <strong>sileleddaang</strong> with its figure called <strong>patay</strong> (with one dancer despairing, the other comforting), which is also found in the <strong>ti liday</strong> and <strong>purpuri</strong> of Tarlac. In the Capiz <strong>sa-ad</strong>, the hapless Indo serves Aning and her family for a long time, only to find out that she has eloped with someone else. The objects of courtship in the <strong>lulay</strong> of Laguna, the <strong>manang biday</strong> of Ilocos (both with singing), the <strong>rogelia</strong> of La Union, and the <strong>pastora</strong> of Pangasinan are quite obvious. Less precise are the <strong>costurera</strong> (seamstress) of Iloilo, the <strong>virgoire</strong> (virgin air) of Antique, the <strong>kumakaret</strong> (wine or vinegar maker) of Pangasinan, the <strong>ilocana a nasudi</strong> (the lovely Ilocana) of Ilocos Norte, the <strong>timawa</strong> (free person) of Capiz, the <strong>libon boli</strong> (beautiful lady) of Cotabato, and the <strong>magkatipan</strong> (sweethearts) and the <strong>sayaw sa pag-ibig</strong> (dance of love) among the Tagalog. The metaphors are obvious in the <strong>ohoy</strong>, <strong>alibangbang</strong> (hey, butterfly) of Capiz, and the <strong>mariposa</strong> of Pangasinan, where boys pretend to be butterflies to the girls&rsquo; flowers, or flirtatious doves in the <strong>palomita coquitana</strong> of Capiz and the <strong>salampati</strong> of Samar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Sulu Archipelago, there are many courtship dances, like the <strong>dalling-dalling</strong>, the <strong>sua-sua</strong>, and the <strong>gandingan</strong>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong></a> varieties&nbsp;include the <strong>bula-bula</strong>, which is danced with bamboo castanets; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>igal ha agung</strong></a> where a woman teases a man as she dances on top of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>; the <strong>pangasig</strong> where a man woos a woman with a <em>tungtung</em> (small gong); and the <strong>pangilok</strong> and <strong>eringan</strong>, which are similar, except that the latter uses <em>janggay</em> or extended false fingernails (Amilbangsa 1983).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nuptial negotiations and ceremonies are such great occasions that they may, as among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a> in Cotabato and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> in Palawan, take many days and the aid of a go-between before they are concluded. Marriages must be negotiated according to the parties&rsquo; worth, compatibility, and, finally, dowry. After arrangements are concluded, the marriage ceremony and feast are held. At the feast, the newlywed couple or their relatives and friends perform distinct dances. A traditional Cebuano wedding dance performed as a tribute to the newly married couple is the <strong>alap</strong>, also referred to as <strong>alusalus</strong> or <strong>gala-gala</strong>. Here, a couple representing the groom&rsquo;s relatives dance, urge the guests to make an offering to the bride by putting coins in a basin or plate placed near the bride&rsquo;s feet. Then, a couple representing the bride&rsquo;s relatives dance, exhort all to make a similar offering for the couple by placing coins in the plate or basin at the groom&rsquo;s feet. In one variant, relatives, friends, and guests place coins in a container as an offering to the new couple. In another regional variant, the bride and groom themselves dance on a mat spread out on the floor while guests throw money onto the mat. After the dance, the mat is rolled up and the money gathered and given to the couple. In other regional versions, the newlyweds dance with each other or with relatives, as the audience pin money on the wedding costumes of bride and groom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A wife may be extremely attentive, as in the <strong>bulakenya</strong> of Camarines Norte, where the woman serves a man seated in a chair by putting his hat on his head, wiping his forehead, and combing his hair. She may also bring him lunch and help him in the field in the <strong>sainita</strong> of Nueva Vizcaya, or rebuke him for leaving her in the <strong>pinatalatto cu ta futu cao</strong> of Cagayan. The man may leave but pledge loyalty, as in the <strong>despedida</strong> of Capiz. There are wedding dances that feature not only dancing by the bride and groom, but also their respective parents in cross-tandem (bride&rsquo;s father and groom&rsquo;s mother, etc.), as well as <strong>gala</strong> or gift giving. Paper money may also be pinned to the couple&rsquo;s suit and gown as in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo ivatan</strong></a> in Batanes, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota echague&ntilde;a</strong></a> in Isabela, the <strong>sinasambali</strong> in Zambales, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/79\"><strong>pantomina</strong></a> in Bicol, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/71\"><strong>mascota</strong></a> in Cagayan, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2350\">Isinay</a> <strong>imbestida</strong> in Nueva Vizcaya, the <strong>pinundopundo</strong> in Cuyo, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>pandang-pandang</strong></a>, also known as the <strong>yano pandani&ntilde;o</strong>, in Antique. In this last dance, the groom supposedly dances and prances about as though he had a gecko in his trousers. Parents also inevitably dance in the <strong>likod-likod</strong> in Ormoc, the <strong>lauderes</strong> in Iloilo, the <strong>virgoire</strong> and the <strong>soryano</strong> in Antique and among the Tagbanua in Palawan, the <strong>escala</strong> in Misamis Occidental, and the <strong>urukay</strong> of Antique, where the man makes the woman crawl through his legs. The <em>magbalaye</em> (in-laws) also dance the more metaphorical <strong>kandang-kandang</strong> in Antique, which in a song to nature sung by a <em>manoglanton</em> makes references specifically to a planet so named that looks like a sea urchin. The <strong>anuncio</strong> in Mindoro starts with the groom looking for his bride in a crowd. He flourishes his <em>hapay</em> or kerchief or drops it before her. The onlookers sing songs of flattery and wordplay. In the <strong>hilo de iris</strong> in Antique, the bride and groom are offered a &ldquo;thread of flowers.&rdquo; The <strong>desposorio</strong> of Bulacan starts with the groom leading a procession to his bride&rsquo;s house, bearing the picture of Joseph and Mary, model husband and wife. At the bride&rsquo;s house, there is more dancing; in Panasahan, Malolos, this dance is called <strong>sayaw panasahan</strong>.

Also in Bontoc, the <strong>pallakis</strong>, danced during a <em>ca&ntilde;ao</em>,&nbsp;<em>begnas&nbsp;</em>(feast before farming), or wedding, features a man and a woman who hold up or shake colorful blankets as they turn or circle around. Among the Apayao and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a>, dancers imitate swooping birds with the same use of blankets in the <strong>pingpingaw</strong> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/102\"><strong>tadek</strong></a>.

The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Bilaan</a> imitate the flight and chirping of mating birds in the <strong>kanfu de dafeng</strong>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> imitate the birds by manipulating a <em>malong</em> (tubular skirt) or a shawl, while a man dances with a <em>haglong</em> (a boatlike <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>). In the Tiruray <strong>sinukdo</strong>, a couple circles a kerchief, which the woman picks up at the end. Instead of cloth, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> maiden holds up a shredded banana leaf and a male shakes a <em>kalasag</em> (shield) in the <strong>pangalitawo</strong>. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, a scarf placed on a partner&rsquo;s shoulder means assent in the courtship dance <strong>tagongo</strong>.

European-inspired <a href=\"/6/46/96\">social dances</a>, such as the indigenized minute <strong>alcamfor</strong> from Leyte and the <strong>habasinan</strong> in Pangasinan, can also be vehicles for courtship. The exhibitionistic <a href=\"/6/46/66\"><strong>kuratsa</strong></a> in Ilocos, Bicol, and the Visayas can start with playful male-female contests and end in mutual understanding. Even a <a href=\"/6/46/70\">combat dance</a> among the <a href=\"/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> which is done at weddings, the dance rivalry over a widow among the Talaingod, and the rivalry over a man among the Matigsalug, are dances of courtship."

				"value": "The <strong>apas-apas</strong> (going after) at a <em>belasyon</em> (novena at a wake) in Antique is a courtship dance, as are the <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> and Visayan varieties of the <a href=\"/6/46/35\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a> that feature a song and dance debate between males and females. The Samar <strong>ismayling</strong> (from English, smiling) and the <strong>sampaguita</strong> from Cebu are similar to the balitaw. The <strong>cari&#xF1;osa</strong> features the devious yet obvious devices of a fan and a handkerchief for a play of hide-and-seek in many of its figures. These devices are also used in the <strong>pag-aring</strong> in Samar. A pair of earrings is used in the <strong>putrillo</strong> of Leyte, a Chinese saucer in the <strong>pinggan-pinggan</strong> of Bohol, and the sampaguita in the <strong>an marol</strong> of Samar. The <strong>like</strong> (coquetry) in Negros and Antique may go beyond the man&#x2019;s pleading to the woman&#x2019;s lifting of her skirt. The man may play-act, looking dejected with an elbow on a knee and propping up his drooped head on a spurned hand as in the <strong>maramyon</strong> in Leyte, and the <strong>voluntario</strong> in Iloilo and Antique which is about guerrillas during the Spanish colonial era, or the <strong>lingawen</strong> in Samar, which is similarly about a subversive who goes off to the mountains. The man may pretend to be dying in the Abra <strong>biniganbigat</strong>. Instead of the usual pair, two girls and a boy perform the <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> <strong>la berde</strong>, a courtship and wedding dance. A woman may &#x201C;resist&#x201D; by putting up her palms, shading her face, or by mimicking a clam in the <strong>gumanhap</strong> of Cebu. She may play <em>hele-hele</em> (coy), as in a dance so named or in the <strong>saguin-saguin</strong> of Albay. Another Visayan courtship dance is the <strong>miligoy</strong> performed by a couple, usually at weddings, baptisms, and fiestas. The man may brag about his strength with &#x201C;seven spears and eight bolos&#x201D; in the <strong>inday na kunday</strong> in Leyte, to which the woman replies that only God is really powerful. On the other hand, a woman may be so distraught over a man&#x2019;s relentless pursuit as to stab herself in the <strong>punyal ni Rosa</strong> (Rosa&#x2019;s dagger) in Laguna. Love can be sad, as in the <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> <strong>sileleddaang</strong> with its figure called <strong>patay</strong> (with one dancer despairing, the other comforting), which is also found in the <strong>ti liday</strong> and <strong>purpuri</strong> of Tarlac. In the Capiz <strong>sa-ad</strong>, the hapless Indo serves Aning and her family for a long time, only to find out that she has eloped with someone else. The objects of courtship in the <strong>lulay</strong> of Laguna, the <strong>manang biday</strong> of Ilocos (both with singing), the <strong>rogelia</strong> of La Union, and the <strong>pastora</strong> of Pangasinan are quite obvious. Less precise are the <strong>costurera</strong> (seamstress) of Iloilo, the <strong>virgoire</strong> (virgin air) of Antique, the <strong>kumakaret</strong> (wine or vinegar maker) of Pangasinan, the <strong>ilocana a nasudi</strong> (the lovely Ilocana) of Ilocos Norte, the <strong>timawa</strong> (free person) of Capiz, the <strong>libon boli</strong> (beautiful lady) of Cotabato, and the <strong>magkatipan</strong> (sweethearts) and the <strong>sayaw sa pag-ibig</strong> (dance of love) among the Tagalog. The metaphors are obvious in the <strong>ohoy</strong>, <strong>alibangbang</strong> (hey, butterfly) of Capiz, and the <strong>mariposa</strong> of Pangasinan, where boys pretend to be butterflies to the girls&#x2019; flowers, or flirtatious doves in the <strong>palomita coquitana</strong> of Capiz and the <strong>salampati</strong> of Samar."

The <a href=\"/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong></a> varieties&#xA0;include the <strong>bula-bula</strong>, which is danced with bamboo castanets; the <a href=\"/6/46/78\"><strong>igal ha agung</strong></a> where a woman teases a man as she dances on top of a <a href=\"/5/37/810\">gong</a>; the <strong>pangasig</strong> where a man woos a woman with a <em>tungtung</em> (small gong); and the <strong>pangilok</strong> and <strong>eringan</strong>, which are similar, except that the latter uses <em>janggay</em> or extended false fingernails (Amilbangsa 1983)."

				"value": "Nuptial negotiations and ceremonies are such great occasions that they may, as among the <a href=\"/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a> in Cotabato and the <a href=\"/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> in Palawan, take many days and the aid of a go-between before they are concluded. Marriages must be negotiated according to the parties&#x2019; worth, compatibility, and, finally, dowry. After arrangements are concluded, the marriage ceremony and feast are held. At the feast, the newlywed couple or their relatives and friends perform distinct dances. A traditional Cebuano wedding dance performed as a tribute to the newly married couple is the <strong>alap</strong>, also referred to as <strong>alusalus</strong> or <strong>gala-gala</strong>. Here, a couple representing the groom&#x2019;s relatives dance, urge the guests to make an offering to the bride by putting coins in a basin or plate placed near the bride&#x2019;s feet. Then, a couple representing the bride&#x2019;s relatives dance, exhort all to make a similar offering for the couple by placing coins in the plate or basin at the groom&#x2019;s feet. In one variant, relatives, friends, and guests place coins in a container as an offering to the new couple. In another regional variant, the bride and groom themselves dance on a mat spread out on the floor while guests throw money onto the mat. After the dance, the mat is rolled up and the money gathered and given to the couple. In other regional versions, the newlyweds dance with each other or with relatives, as the audience pin money on the wedding costumes of bride and groom."

				"value": "A wife may be extremely attentive, as in the <strong>bulakenya</strong> of Camarines Norte, where the woman serves a man seated in a chair by putting his hat on his head, wiping his forehead, and combing his hair. She may also bring him lunch and help him in the field in the <strong>sainita</strong> of Nueva Vizcaya, or rebuke him for leaving her in the <strong>pinatalatto cu ta futu cao</strong> of Cagayan. The man may leave but pledge loyalty, as in the <strong>despedida</strong> of Capiz. There are wedding dances that feature not only dancing by the bride and groom, but also their respective parents in cross-tandem (bride&#x2019;s father and groom&#x2019;s mother, etc.), as well as <strong>gala</strong> or gift giving. Paper money may also be pinned to the couple&#x2019;s suit and gown as in the <a href=\"/6/46/77\"><strong>pandanggo ivatan</strong></a> in Batanes, the <a href=\"/6/46/62\"><strong>jota echague&#xF1;a</strong></a> in Isabela, the <strong>sinasambali</strong> in Zambales, the <a href=\"/6/46/79\"><strong>pantomina</strong></a> in Bicol, the <a href=\"/6/46/71\"><strong>mascota</strong></a> in Cagayan, the <a href=\"/1/2/2350\">Isinay</a> <strong>imbestida</strong> in Nueva Vizcaya, the <strong>pinundopundo</strong> in Cuyo, and the <a href=\"/6/46/77\"><strong>pandang-pandang</strong></a>, also known as the <strong>yano pandani&#xF1;o</strong>, in Antique. In this last dance, the groom supposedly dances and prances about as though he had a gecko in his trousers. Parents also inevitably dance in the <strong>likod-likod</strong> in Ormoc, the <strong>lauderes</strong> in Iloilo, the <strong>virgoire</strong> and the <strong>soryano</strong> in Antique and among the Tagbanua in Palawan, the <strong>escala</strong> in Misamis Occidental, and the <strong>urukay</strong> of Antique, where the man makes the woman crawl through his legs. The <em>magbalaye</em> (in-laws) also dance the more metaphorical <strong>kandang-kandang</strong> in Antique, which in a song to nature sung by a <em>manoglanton</em> makes references specifically to a planet so named that looks like a sea urchin. The <strong>anuncio</strong> in Mindoro starts with the groom looking for his bride in a crowd. He flourishes his <em>hapay</em> or kerchief or drops it before her. The onlookers sing songs of flattery and wordplay. In the <strong>hilo de iris</strong> in Antique, the bride and groom are offered a &#x201C;thread of flowers.&#x201D; The <strong>desposorio</strong> of Bulacan starts with the groom leading a procession to his bride&#x2019;s house, bearing the picture of Joseph and Mary, model husband and wife.

		"text": "<p><strong>Cultural dance</strong> is a term that loosely describes the type of dancing performed in restaurants, bars, cruise ships, tourist sites, and tourist events in the Philippines and abroad. The dancing includes Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a> folk, current popular dances, and novelty dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest example of cultural dancing was performed by members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a> in the early 1960s. Acquiring recognition from their debut at the Brussels Universal Exposition in Belgium in 1958, the Bayanihan performances were viewed by international tourism organizers as emblematic of Oriental culture and the group was tapped as exotic cultural performers for the Century 21 Exposition aka Seattle World&rsquo;s Fair, an enormous six-month event in 1962 that sold more than 10 million tickets to tourists from all over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Las Vegas City in Nevada, USA, which became popular as a gambling and entertainment capital, popularized the type of cultural dancing that capitalized on exoticism and sex. Steve Parker, better known as the former husband of Shirley MacLaine, produced the long-running <em><strong>Philippine Festival</strong></em> at the Dunes in Las Vegas in 1961. The show was promoted as an exotic treat featuring &ldquo;75 Ravishing Island Queens!&rdquo; Among those who were recruited by Parker to perform in Las Vegas were dancers from the Bayanihan, namely, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2419\">Rose Borromeo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>, the latter proclaimed National Artist in dance in 2014. What became popular in the mid-1960s was the type of cultural dancing that consisted of folkloric exhibitions of traditional Philippine dances combined with modern, glitzy cultural shows patterned after the Las Vegas productions. In 1964, the Bayanihan was in the forefront of such performances in Australia.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1970s, cultural performances proliferated in restaurants and tourist sites in Manila. An example of a dance group involved in this type of cultural dancing is the Folklorico Filipino Dance Company with members coming from the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG)</a>. The group performed in reputable restaurants, international cruise ships, and tourism events with a repertoire consisting of dances and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> similar to those of the Bayanihan and the ROFG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For over two decades, from the 1980s to the early 2000s, hundreds of thousands of Filipino entertainers, majority of them women, worked abroad as entertainers, either as singers or cultural dancers in Japan or in other Asian nations, as well as Middle Eastern and European countries. As most performers had little training and experience in dance, the term &ldquo;cultural dancer&rdquo; was often placed in quotation marks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japan was the most common destination of Filipino cultural dancers. The overseas departures for Japan started in the late 1970s. This was also a time when Japan experienced continuous economic growth, resulting in the demand for cultural dancers, vocalists, and hostesses in Japan night clubs and hotels. By the mid-1990s, the number of entertainers in Japan was estimated at 80,000. The relatively large incomes of cultural dancers must often be shared with promoters, who have invested in studios, dormitories, or job placement agencies. Many dancers were exploited by recruiters, who sometimes exported them illegally. Once abroad, many performers discovered that they must render &ldquo;extra-cultural&rdquo; or hostessing services while assigned to hotels and clubs, which ranged from the grand to the dingy. Most male dancers ended up as waiters. The export of cultural dancers declined in 1995-96 due to the imposition of new regulations by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) of the Department of Labor and Employment. Previously, POEA regulations only had an audition system of the most elementary kind in order to qualify as a dancer, singer, musician, and specialty performer (magician or other variety entertainers), who were then certified with a numbered card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority or TESDA elicited the help of professional dancers and dance educators to elevate the dance qualification of aspirants. This included basic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> dancing skills and increase in the age limit of applicants to 23 years old, later reduced to 21 years old. In 2004, the US State Department&rsquo;s report on human trafficking categorized Japan and the Philippines under countries that failed to stop or prevent human trafficking. The report put pressure on the Japanese government to impose stricter measures against the entry of foreign entertainers, thus ending the exodus of Filipino overseas cultural dancers to Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, a Korean business group ventured into producing the <em><strong>Amazing Show</strong></em> in Manila and Cebu. The show employed beautiful transgender and gay performers who were considered among the most in-demand cultural dancers for their talent, versatility, and flamboyance. By 2011, the <em><strong>Amazing Show</strong></em> had been seen by over 350,000 people, making it perhaps the Philippines&rsquo;&nbsp;most watched performance event. The show continues to draw foreign and local audiences due to its spectacular production numbers that include ethnic dances from the Cordillera and Southern Philippines, traditional Chinese and Korean dances, Korean <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">pop song</a> and dance numbers, and excerpts from Hollywood movies like <em><strong>Dreamgirls</strong></em> and Broadway <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a> like <em><strong>Cabaret</strong></em> and <em><strong>Fame</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2010s, the move to make tourism a leading industry has stimulated the development of cultural dancing not only in Manila but in other tourist destinations like Boracay, Cebu, Bohol, and Davao. These cultural-variety shows are organized in hotels, restaurants, events places, and tourist sites and provide jobs for performers, technical staff, and promoters. Dancers may or may not have substantial dance training and experience. Examples of restaurants and sites that promote touristic cultural dancing are the Jungle Restaurant in Mactan, Cebu; the Bohol Cultural Park in Dauis, Bohol; Fridays Resort in Boracay; and the Tribu K&rsquo;Mindanawan cultural village in Davao City. The dance selection may include Philippine folk and ethnic dance suites, pop dances, sexy but wholesome dances, and novelty numbers like fire dancing.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2621\">Basilio Esteban S.

		"text": "<p><strong>Dancesport</strong> combines dance as an artistic expression, as a social activity and as an athletic feat. It is performed by partners, a woman and a man, who compete against other couples on the same dance floor all at the same time. In the past, it was called &ldquo;competitive ballroom dancing&rdquo; but the name was changed to dancesport with the increased emphasis on athleticism. Dancesport demands strength, endurance, agility, coordination, teamwork, grace, musicality, artistic interpretation, and choreographic skill. The International Olympic Committee recognizes it as a sport, which may be included in the Olympics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a competition, dancesport organizations have their own parameters in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume</a> or dress code, age restriction, and judging requisites. Generally, couples perform five Latin and five standard/international dances. Each dance is executed according to a strict tempo and music, which become the basis for judging the technique and quality of movement. The five Latin dances are samba, cha-cha, rhumba, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\">paso doble</a>, and jive. The five standard dances are waltz, tango, Viennese waltz, slow foxtrot, and quickstep.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The international category requires specific costumes: an aristocratic formal suit for the male, along with a short and clean haircut. The female wears a flowing gown that accentuates the feminine form, with colorful accents like floats, feathers, drapes, and boas to get the judges&rsquo; attention. Hair is done in a dramatic but sophisticated style. For the Latin category, the male dancer usually wears a loose top opened to the navel, along with tight-fitting trousers that cling to the body. The female dancer usually wears a short, sensual, and tight-fitting dress, or a glamorized version of what women wear in Havana or Rio. In hairstyle, the Latin category allows the male to sport facial hair as well as long tresses which nevertheless must have masculine appeal. Meanwhile, women can wear short hair or ponytails. In both categories, the costumes must enhance the masculine and feminine characteristics of the partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dancesport in the Philippines began in 1996 when the Blackpool modern standard champion, Paul Bishop, linked the Philippine Sports Commission to the World Dance and Dancesport Council&mdash;one of the world&rsquo;s leading organizations in dancesport. Interested in participating in the World Ballroom Championship and in the Olympics, the commission sought the assistance of socialite and lambada dancer Becky Garcia. She subsequently became the first president of the Dancesport Council of the Philippines, Inc (DSCPI), a position she still holds as of this writing. DSCPI held the first dance congress at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium in 1997 to introduce the competitive style of ballroom dancing. In the same year, two couples represented the Philippines in the international competition in Bangkok. In succeeding years, the country won international awards: Michael Mendoza won Dancesport in the South East Asian Games. Alberto Dimarucut and Deborah Civardi were the first Filipino professionals to represent the country in Blackpool, England in 2000. Edna Ledesma, who was partnered by John Co in the Latin senior division, became the first Filipina to win a gold medal in the prestigious Blackpool Competition in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pres Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed Proclamation 203, declaring Nov 4 to 10 as National Dancesport Week in 2002. Today, dancesport competitions have become widespread in schools and universities all around the Philippines. An indication of the popularity of dancesport is its inclusion as a sport event in the competitions held by sports associations like the State Colleges and Universities Athletic Association, the Private Schools Athletic Association, and the Association of Local Colleges and Universities. <strong>Wheelchair dancing</strong> is an evolution of dancesport, introduced in 2013 at the DSCPI National Championship. This was initiated by Genice &ldquo;Bong&rdquo; Marquez in collaboration with the Tahanang Walang Hagdanan in order to give persons with disabilities an opportunity to discover and showcase their talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practitioners in the field are aggressive in training teachers and coaches. The establishment of professional dancesport organizations like the Philippine Dance Teacher Association, the Philippine Dance Sport Association of the Philippines, and the DSCPI-Professional Division allowed professional dancers to help in the growth of the industry through conferences, seminars, and workshops. Since the entry of dancesport in the Philippines, Filipinos have excelled in the field, winning gold and silver medals in the 2005 Southeast Asian Games, bronze medals in the 2010 Asian Games, gold and bronze medals in the 2013 Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Game, and silver medal in the Asian Paralympic Games 2014 Wheelchair Dancesport.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Alberto L.

The female wears a flowing gown that accentuates the feminine form, with colorful accents like floats, feathers, drapes, and boas to get the judges&#x2019; attention. Hair is done in a dramatic but sophisticated style. For the Latin category, the male dancer usually wears a loose top opened to the navel, along with tight-fitting trousers that cling to the body. The female dancer usually wears a short, sensual, and tight-fitting dress, or a glamorized version of what women wear in Havana or Rio. In hairstyle, the Latin category allows the male to sport facial hair as well as long tresses which nevertheless must have masculine appeal. Meanwhile, women can wear short hair or ponytails. In both categories, the costumes must enhance the masculine and feminine characteristics of the partners."

Interested in participating in the World Ballroom Championship and in the Olympics, the commission sought the assistance of socialite and lambada dancer Becky Garcia. She subsequently became the first president of the Dancesport Council of the Philippines, Inc (DSCPI), a position she still holds as of this writing. DSCPI held the first dance congress at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium in 1997 to introduce the competitive style of ballroom dancing. In the same year, two couples represented the Philippines in the international competition in Bangkok. In succeeding years, the country won international awards: Michael Mendoza won Dancesport in the South East Asian Games. Alberto Dimarucut and Deborah Civardi were the first Filipino professionals to represent the country in Blackpool, England in 2000. Edna Ledesma, who was partnered by John Co in the Latin senior division, became the first Filipina to win a gold medal in the prestigious Blackpool Competition in 2005."

		"text": "<p>The <strong>diyandi</strong> is a traditional dance performed in Iligan City, Lanao del Norte during the feast of the city&rsquo;s patron saint, San Miguel or Saint Michael, every 29 Sep. It is a religious <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a>, performed only by women, as a <strong>halad</strong>/<strong>panaad</strong> (prayer-offering) to Archangel Michael, who is revered by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> who regard him as a heavenly being in the Koran, and by the Iliganon who look up to him both as an angel and a warrior capable of defending them and their city. The dance is symbolic of the historical relations of the three dominant groups in the region&mdash;the indigenous Higaonon, the Muslim Maranao, and the Christian settlers&mdash;as it assimilates Higaonon and Maranao dances, songs, and verses in a Christian ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Spanish colonization, Mindanao was one of the most difficult frontiers to penetrate due to strong native and Moro resistance. It was only during the mid-19th century that Spanish presence came to be felt. Eventually, it led to the Christianization of some native inhabitants and the influx of non-indigenous and non-Moro settlers to the area. This displaced the indigenous and Islamic groups, many of whom moved to the hinterlands. One of the ways by which the colonizers then tried to win over the locals was by throwing colorful fiestas that attracted the curiosity of the natives. Part of these fiestas was the diyandi, meaning &ldquo;to celebrate.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, the diyandi was known as the dance of the youth, performed only by children ages 6-12. It was performed by 12 dancers divided into two groups: six wearing traditional female Higaonon garb, and six wearing traditional male Maranao garb. Then as now, the dancers are also called <em>diyandi</em>. The eldest in the group leads the performance and is called the <strong>kapitana</strong>. The youngest in the group, called <strong>anac-anac</strong> (child), bears food offerings of <em>piyak</em> (chick), <em>orak</em> (egg), <em>cagcawa</em> (ginger), and <em>lasona</em> (garlic). The Higaonon <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume</a> consists of a knee-length skirt called <em>saya ha pinanguntingan</em>, a blouse that comes down to the midriff called <em>pinagsoy ha sinulawan</em>, a comb called <em>panika</em> worn in the hair, necklaces, bracelets, and other ornaments worn around the feet and ankles. The Maranao costume is made up of a pair of loose pants, a loose waist-length blouse with long sleeves, and a <em>tubao</em> (kerchief) wrapped around the head. They bear ritual offerings in a pouch attached to a sash slung around their torso. All dancers carry a tubao with varying designs in their hands. Two lead dancers, one for the Higaonon and one for the Maranao, called <strong>pangabaga</strong> (right hand), help the kapitana lead everyone through the dance. The entire performance is danced barefoot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beginning of the Feast of Se&ntilde;or San Miguel is marked by the <em>pagkanaug</em>, or the bringing down of San Miguel&rsquo;s image from its pedestal at the center of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">cathedral</a> altar. It is cleaned and dressed, complete with its <em>kalo</em> (helmet), <em>taming</em> or <em>kalasag</em> (shield), and <em>bangkaw</em> (spear) with a banner attached to it. As the image is prepared, the diyandi dance and sing the <em>gosos</em> (canticles) of Se&ntilde;or San Miguel, along with other devotees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the fifth day of the feast, a dance competition called <strong>kasadya</strong> (merrymaking) is held at the town plaza, featuring Iliganon dances including the <strong>sinulog</strong>, a dance based on the Filipino martial art <em>eskrima</em> with the performers dressed in Maranao costumes; <strong>yawa-yawa</strong>, meaning &ldquo;devil-devil,&rdquo; a <em>comedia</em> about the life of Se&ntilde;or San Miguel; and the <strong>diyandi</strong>, the dance of the women and of the youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diyandi is performed in front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> on the ninth day of novena, typically in the morning. Afterwards, the diyandi dancers move from house to house to partake of food offered by neighbors and local officials. They may also do this to show their gratitude. Again, the diyandi is also danced during the Feast of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario on the first week of October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sound of the <em>agong</em> marks the beginning of the performance. A specific beat is played as the Higaonon enter in a swaying motion, hands poised on their hips. The Maranao enter in the same style and the hands holding the kerchief move toward the opposite shoulders. Throughout the dance, the hand that is flipped and waved dictates the movement of the feet. Every hand gesture is followed by an intense gaze. Once all the dancers are in position, they raise their hands in unison, kiss the kerchiefs, and bring their hands down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are nine identifiable parts in the traditional diyandi. First is the <strong>uruyan</strong>. The formation breaks into two as the Higaonon circle to the right and the Maranao circle to the left while the kapitana and anac-anac remain in the middle. The two lines eventually draw up alongside the kapitana and anac-anac. Once the two pangabaga reach the middle, the kapitana moves between them and begins to dance with them again. The anac-anac remains at the end of the formation, between the last two Maranao and Higaonon dancers. The second part is the singing of <em><strong>Tominongbong Day Dinhe</strong></em> (Come Down Here), the first song of the diyandi, sung without any musical accompaniment. The third part is the <strong>berso</strong>, wherein the kapitana leads the diyandi in the recitation of verses. Fourth is the <strong>sayaw sa anac-anac</strong> (dance of the child). The dancers form a circle with the kapitana sitting in the middle. The anac-anac then dances around her, to the clapping and the rhythm of the agong. From the circular formation, the diyandi break up and flutter around like butterflies for the fifth part of the dance called <strong>alibangbang</strong> (butterfly). Then they form a line of alternating Higanonon and Maranao dancers for the <strong>luhod-luhod</strong> (kneeling), the sixth part. The diyandi dance on their knees as they move and flap their hands by their waists. In the next two parts of the dance, <strong>gabas-gabas</strong> and <strong>kinadena</strong>, the dancers interpret in movement the formation of a chain that binds them all together as one people. In the final part of the dance, called <strong>panyo-panyo</strong>, the Higaonon and Maranao dancers meet in the middle and exchange kerchiefs as a symbol of their friendship and acceptance of each other. Other songs sung in the diyandi are <em><strong>Dalagang Day Bukid</strong></em> (The Country Lass) and <em><strong>Ang Iliganon nga Buotan&nbsp;</strong></em>(The Kind Iliganon). After the performance, all the dancers lift their hands and shout, &ldquo;Viva Se&ntilde;or San Miguel!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No one knows who first taught the diyandi dance as it has been performed in this format. The earliest documented teacher is Sancha Leonar-Cabillon, who danced as a kapitana alongside Hilaria Zalsos Cambalong, who performed as anac-anac, circa 1915. Both were under the tutelage of Carlos Leonar, known as Tiyo Alo or Mang Alo, who was a cantor in the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1977, Felicidad Actub, head of Katilingbanong Kapunungang Iliganon, an Iliganon organization, was assigned by then Mayor Camilo Cabili to establish a diyandi dance group. To fulfill the task, Actub traced the verses used in the diyandi to the care of Lydia Madrazo-Seraspe, the daughter of Tomasa Fuego Madrazo, who had learned it from Sancha Leonar-Cabillon. However, the verses Tomasa Fuego Madrazo had collected were incomplete, and so Actub and her group decided to simply divide the recovered verses and appropriate them for later renditions of the dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the diyandi is danced not only by the youth. It has been ascribed a more religious rather than festive significance, as <em>halad</em> or <em>panaad</em> to the patron saint. Performances have also become more dominantly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>. Costumes remain patterned after traditional clothes but have been infused with ornaments like sequins and beads. In 2004, the Iligan City Council established the Diyandi Festival through a resolution, turning the fiesta into a month-long tourist attraction.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Louise Jashil Sonido</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Navidad, Estrella. 1995. &quot;Diyandi: Alaala ng Kahapon, Panaad sa Kasalukuyan, at Larawan ng Tunggalian.&quot; MA thesis.

		"text": "<p><strong>Dugso</strong>, <strong>dugsu</strong> or <strong>dinugsu</strong> is a complex <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dance</a> performed by women during the <strong>kaliga</strong> ceremonies of the Bukidnon. The term &ldquo;Bukidnon&rdquo; means &ldquo;mountain dweller&rdquo; in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> language. It also refers to the four ethnic sub-groups in Mindanao: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> in northeastern Mindanao, the Talaandig in the northwestern part of Bukidnon province, the Higaonon in Misamis Oriental and Agusan del Norte, and the Banwaon in Agusan del Sur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kaliga <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> or <strong>kaliga-on</strong> is composed of elaborate ceremonies that employ prayers, dugso, songs, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chants</a>, and music from a <em>dagingen</em> (hanging xylophone) and the <em>agung</em> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>). The kaliga is performed to communicate with recognized spirits or gods assigned by the supreme being, Magbabaya. These deities are responsible for specific functions like ensuring success in planting, reaping a bountiful harvest, and healing of diseases. The kaliga has a portion where the women perform responsorial songs called <em>tabuk</em>, after which they hold hands in half-circle formation around the <em>bangkasu</em> or altar to dance the dugso. The dancers may also dance around a <em>dapulan</em> or ceremonial fire placed inside a wooden container. Its smoke is believed to carry the mortal entreaties to the gods. Men sometimes join the women in dancing the dugso.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The solemn dance has no musical accompaniment. Led by a female babaylan or shaman, the dugso has seven figures performed with various foot movements on the ground or on the bamboo floor. The feet stamp, kick, and glide, providing an earthy bass to the curious jangle of the women&rsquo;s <em>sandak</em> (brass bracelets) and <em>singgil</em> (anklets). The rhythmic sounds are enhanced by the tinkling of <em>saliyaw</em> and <em>lingkit</em> (small bells) which adorn their <em>salay</em> (necklaces) and <em>palakut</em> (belts). Sound from footwork and ornaments has six rhythmic patterns. There are two variants of the dugso known as <strong>hinaklaran</strong> and <strong>lagudas</strong> which may be performed with instrumental accompaniment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first figure of the dance is called <strong>dinatag</strong> (introduction) that produces the first rhythmic pattern. With arms in T-position, dancers join hands and move in clockwise and counterclockwise directions: Brush left foot backward, tap left foot close to right, step left sideward, and then repeat. Step right foot behind left foot, tap left foot close to right, step left sideward and repeat. Brush right foot backward, tap right foot close to left, then step right foot sideward. Step left over right, tap right close to left, then step sideward right. Step left behind right, step sideward right, and then repeat. Performers repeat dinatag once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second figure called <strong>sinangka</strong> creates the second rhythmic pattern as dancers move in counterclockwise direction. Joining hands and with arms in T-position, dancers lean sideward to the right as they raise left foot in front. Then they step left sideward, tap right close to left, step right sideward, and tap left foot close to right. Then they swing hands downward as left foot steps sideward; the right foot closes to left; then dancers step left sideward and raise their right foot as their torsos lean sideward left, swinging arms upward to T-position. The steps are repeated from the start, still moving counterclockwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third figure called <strong>sinayaw</strong> (dance-like) has yet another rhythmic pattern. Brush left foot backward, tap left foot close to right, and step sideward left; step right behind left, tap left close to right, step sideward left, and repeat the first two footwork patterns; brush right foot backward, tap right foot close to left, then step sideward right; step left foot over right, tap right close to left, step sideward right, and repeat first two footwork patterns; stamp left foot and clap hands while bending torso forward; turn towards left and step left foot forward, tap and step right; then tap and step left, and stamp right foot sideward two times with arms raised in reverse T-position on the second count. Repeat the last pattern to the right starting with right foot. Repeat sinayaw once more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth figure producing another rhythmic pattern is called <strong>inulang</strong> (shrimp-like). The women join hands in reverse T-position and do footwork in counterclockwise direction. They start with left foot forward, stamp right close to left foot, then stamp right foot backward, and repeat footwork pattern twice. They stamp left twice and stamp right foot twice. The sequence is repeated three times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fifth figure is called <strong>linibog</strong> (confusion). Dancers start by repeating the first three footwork patterns of dinatag. They proceed to the following footwork which has similar rhythmic pattern as inulang: stamp left over right foot, step right foot behind, stamp left foot obliquely forward, step right foot behind, stamp left once in front and twice sideward. This is repeated from the beginning starting with right foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sixth figure moving counterclockwise is called <strong>sangkulolo</strong>, which imitates the courtship of a rooster and a hen. This figure has another distinct rhythm produced by the sound of footwork: step left foot forward and step right backward; step left forward, stamp right close to left, and step right sideward; stamp and step left foot, then stamp and step sideward right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The footwork of the seventh figure called <strong>pinispis</strong>, or parrot-like behavior, creates the last rhythmic pattern. Women move clockwise, hands connected in reverse T-position, with knees slightly flexed moving in clockwise direction. They brush right foot behind and step left foot in place; brush left foot behind and step left foot in place. They repeat the first pattern. Then they step right behind left foot and step left foot sideward, and repeat counts one and two. They repeat the three footwork patterns thrice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are at least 12 identified types of the dugso and the more popular variants are the <strong>dugso Songco</strong>, <strong>dugso Kalasungay</strong>, <strong>dugso Cabanglasan</strong>, <strong>dugso Lagoras</strong>, <strong>inaksyon</strong>, and the <strong>hinaklaran</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elaborate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume</a> is one of the main attractions of the dance. Among the Higaonon, the complete attire is called <em>sinuyaman</em>. This is composed of the <em>panaksoy</em>, a colorful blouse with bell-shaped sleeves; the <em>saya</em>, a wrap-around skirt secured by a <em>tapis</em> or overskirt designed like two conjoined bibs placed at the sides; and the <em>sulam-sulang</em>, <em>pananggahan</em>, <em>saloloy</em> or <em>pelupandung</em>, all referring to the headdress, which is symbolic of the mythical <em>papagayok</em> bird. The dugso has been performed in the Kaamulan (gathering for a purpose) festival since its inception in 1974. At the time, traditional Bukidnon dancers were the principal performers in the Kaamulan. Since the 2000s, the festival has become the local government&rsquo;s most important event for tourism and publicity. Choreographers are hired to stage the dances including dugso, which, by the standards of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/99\">street dancing</a> for big crowds, is considered repetitious and boring. The traditional dancers among the indigenous peoples are no longer the main actors in the Kaamulan. Young dancers are trained by choreographers. The new version of dugso for street dancing is no longer used for religious purposes. The movements are accompanied by loud cheering and percussion. Footwork and arm movements are accelerated to suit the festive mood. Costumes and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">props</a> are likewise modified to suit this version.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>escotis</strong>/<strong>chotis</strong>/<strong>schottische</strong> is a Filipino term for &ldquo;Scottish,&rdquo; a dance whose running steps and hops suggest that it may truly have been Scottish in origin. In the Philippines, the dance and step combination come in varying step patterns. The escotis is a step, close, step, hop; the working foot is placed at the rear with a bent knee (Reyes-Aquino 1966). Another version is a step, close, step, close (Fajardo 1964). The chotis step can be a brush, place, brush, place, and four-step turn (Reyes-Aquino 1966). The schottische step can be a run, run, run, hop (Sison-Friese 1980).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The schottische found easy acceptance as it developed from the <strong>eccossaise</strong>, a lively dance of the early 1700s. The origin of the eccossaise is likewise controversial, with some authorities pointing to France and others to Scotland. Other scholars insist that it came from the German-Austrian area, and that as early as 1844 in Bavaria, the schottische was performed as the <strong>rheinlander</strong> and was known as the Bavarian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\">polka</a>. In any case, the schottische was a popular ballroom dance from 1800 to 1850. It may have been taught to Filipinos by Spaniards, visiting Europeans, or returning Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European schottische step is done to 4/4 time with a number of possibilities: a step, close, step, hop; or run, run, run, hop. In the hop, the working foot may be placed by the ankle of the supporting foot, swung diagonally or in front of the supporting foot, to finish by pointing on the floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most noted escotis in the Philippines is done at all social gatherings in the barrios of Tinpas, Pasitan in Panay, and the mountainous areas of Capiz. During house warmings, the hopping, jumping, and stamping movements of the dance test the structure&rsquo;s strength and durability. Toward the end, the music is played much faster, eliminating those who are out of breath. At the end, the remaining dancers are asked to whistle as a further test of their endurance and fitness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The escotis has many variants in the Visayas. One version from Kalibo, Aklan, is a three-figure dance. Another is a six-figure dance, but without any escotis step in its figures. Yet another from Roxas City is a five-figure dance, performed by four couples in various floor patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chotis of Camarines Sur was as popular as the waltz, polka, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/72\">mazurka</a>, and danced in scattered, long, set, or quadrille formation. In Lal-lo, Cagayan, it was a favorite among the elderly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a>. In Ilocos Norte, the <strong>chotis dingre&ntilde;a</strong> has been claimed by the elite. <strong>Chotis ilocano</strong> and <strong>chotis vintarina</strong> were performed at many <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> gatherings. Today, it is a popular intermission number at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">social dances</a>. The <strong>chotis de negros</strong> is performed to complete a social gathering.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2480\">Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<section>\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Fajardo, Libertad V.<em>Visayan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a>s</em>.1961, 1964, 1975.Vols I-III.

		"text": "<p><strong>Folk dance</strong> refers to the dances created and performed collectively by the ordinary people. The term usually includes: so-called &ldquo;ethnic dances&rdquo; such as those of the cultural community in the Cordillera, in Mindoro, Palawan, Sulu, and Mindanao; and the rural or lowland Christian dances, among the groups, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>. Folk dances may also be divided into the &ldquo;regional,&rdquo; which refers to dances particular to one locale or area; and the &ldquo;national,&rdquo; which refers to those performed all over the country. Some regional dances, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a> of the Waray have become national dances because they are now performed by groups for all regions. A related term is &ldquo;creative folk dance&rdquo; which refers to character dances whose <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> uses folk steps and music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine folk dances are diverse, and include religious, ceremonial, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship</a>, funeral, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">combative</a>, exorcism, torture, comic, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/57\">game dances</a>. They have been named after saints, heroes, teachers, foreign steps or dances, their countries or places of origin, events, tribes, Philippine steps, a combination of steps, or of steps and places, and a combination of words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine folk dances&mdash;other than religious, ceremonial, and a few <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">social</a>&mdash;are performed with attention to detail and after meticulous rehearsals. Social dances, particularly ballroom dances, may be done on special request or at the spur of the moment. Sometimes folk dances serve as a welcome intermission between ballroom dances and are called <strong>pasakalye</strong> (intermission dances) or <strong>amenudo</strong>, and are performed by a couple or group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filipino ethnic groups still believe in the efficacy of dance as a means of communicating with deity. Christianized Filipinos too dance to plead with, or to thank the Virgin Mary or a patron saint, as in the <strong>turumba</strong> of Pakil, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/100\"><strong>subli</strong></a> of Batangas, and the <strong>sayaw sa apoy</strong> of Cavite. As in Filipino religiosity, the influence of indigenous culture persists, despite colonization.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insects, reptiles, fowls, birds, simians, medicinal and fragrant plants, edible shoots, the national flower, bamboo nodes, and the sound of wind as it passes through the leaves have all been accorded recognition in Philippine dance. Activities such as rice production, broom making, gold panning, fishing, <em>tuba</em> (coconut wine) making, gathering of sweet potatoes, clams or honey, fetching of water, pot making, corn planting, and communal work have been reflected in Philippine folk dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dances use movements of the head, waist, arms, feet throwing, circling, swooping, offering, and crowning. Some dances feature flags, beating with sticks, and swaying motions such as those of drunkards. Hand or stage <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">properties</a> are used: fans, earrings, bench, brass trays, chinaware, plates, oil lamps, drinking glasses, food covers, hats, fish containers, pots, leaves, floral arches, coconut shells, wooden implements, chopsticks, and maypoles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dances are integral to school, community, provincial, regional, and national celebrations. Children in ethnic groups learn their community&rsquo;s dances&nbsp;informally. Christian Filipinos have been learning their dances in school since 1915, when folk dancing was required as part of physical education at all levels. Teacher and professional training courses prescribe advanced folk dances. The Philippine High School for the Arts, established for the gifted, offers a major in folk dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">Research</a> in folk dance was pioneered by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> with the support of then University of the Philippines (UP) president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5123\">Jorge C. Bocobo</a>. This pivotal work was continued by Far Eastern University (FEU), Philippine Normal College (PNC), Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU) and its regional colleges, Mindanao State University (MSU), University of the East (UE), and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\">Philippine Folk Dance Society</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2463\">Libertad V.

Villaruz</a> started recording dances in the Benesh movement notation, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2474\">Larry Gabao</a> in Labanotation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Masteral degree programs in physical education encourage research on Philippine folk dances. Research materials are available at Centro Escolar University, Divine World University, PNC, PWU, UP, University of San Carlos, and University of Santo Tomas (UST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seminars and workshops are conducted yearly by the Philippine Folk Dance Society and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>. To commemorate the Decade of the Child, the Folk Arts Theater&nbsp;and the Bayanihan Alumni separately programmed <em><strong>Indak Pambata</strong></em>, a summer workshop for children. From 1988 to 1991, the UP College of Human Kinetics trained public and private physical education teachers in folk dancing. The National Association of Physical Education and Sports and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2441\">Dance Education Association of the Philippines</a> also conduct national summer congresses and workshops. Since 1990, the CCP has held a regional workshop on the production and staging of folk dances. Performers and tours of folk dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">companies</a> and consultancies complement the CCP outreach program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dance contests are conducted in schools, communities, provinces, regions, and nationwide. Field day demonstrations saw mass participation of students from the 1940s to the 1970s. From 1976 to 1986, street performances by dance groups welcomed visiting dignitaries. More recently, they have been greeted by school children performing dance movements rather than full dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five-star hotels feature folk dance evenings. Multinational companies request dance companies to entertain and enlighten their guests. Folk dances have been presented on board tourist ocean liners at sea, or while docked in Manila Bay. Between 1958 and 1986, PWU held Saturday afternoon recitals with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan</a> trainees to feature newly discovered dances. In 1988 the CCP introduced folk dancing to tourists at the Manila Film Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The renaissance of Philippine folk dance in the mid-1950s led to the inclusion of folk dances in Philippine movies. Folk dance groups were credited in the titles while popular movie stars relearned their folk dance fundamentals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A recent development is the recruitment of dancers, who are given free board and lodging to train in folk dance for variety shows abroad. Government sanction is given by a board of auditioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of prestigious folk dance groups are school-based. Ten years ago, it was not uncommon for every school to have its own dance group. This had reciprocal benefits for the school, the staff, and participants. The Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company of PWU, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2555\">Philippine Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</a> (originally of the Philippine Normal College), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2445\">Darangan Cultural Dance Troupe</a> of MSU, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2465\">FEU Dance Group</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2611\">Salinggawi Dance Troupe</a>&nbsp;of UST, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2612\">UE Dance Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2614\">UP Filipiniana Dance Group</a>, Araullo University Dance Troupe, and Western Visayas State University Dance Company have performed locally and abroad. Of the nonschool-based groups, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2514\">Leyte Kalipayan Dance Company</a>, Department of Tourism Dance Company, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2488\">Hwa Yi Ethnic Dance Center</a>, the defunct Banoan-Saka, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2394\">AlunAlun Dance Circle</a>, and several others have also been outstanding nationally and internationally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Festivals are staged by different provinces, featuring ethnic tribes. Among these are the Kaamulanin Bukidnon, Araw ng Dabao in Davao, San Miguel Diyandi in Lanao, and the Lake Sebu festival in Cotabato. From 1976 to 1981, the Folk Arts Theater held yearly folk festivals participated in by residents from different regions, and conducted with workshops, parades, culinary and craft displays and sales. In 1987, the CCP launched the yearly folk dance festival, <em><strong>Pang-alay</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/99\">Street dancing</a> has been part of the fiesta scene. Authentic folk dance movements with their distinctive hand properties are employed to lend folk revelry and local color. These parades are featured in the Ati-Atihan of Aklan, Sinulog of Cebu, Bohol, and Cuyo, Pintados of Leyte, Dinagyang of Iloilo, Masskara of Bacolod, and the lanzones festival of Camiguin Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crucial tasks that face folk dance today are: continuous research before the dances are forgotten; correct <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documentation</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">training</a> of teachers and researchers; dissemination of updated folk materials; and retention of authenticity in the staging of dances. On the other hand, the creative redefinition of folk themes and movements in choreography should continue toward the deepening of our understanding of Philippine life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk dances from other nations have been introduced to Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">audiences</a> by foreign groups which performed in the Philippine stage, such as the Dancers of Ceylon, 1960; Pakistan Dance Group, 1969; Beryoska Dance Company of Moscow, 1970; Karbadinka Georgian Dance Company, 1972; Indian Classical Dance Troupe of Vjayanthimala Balie, 1973; University of Malaya Dance Troupe, 1974; Ratna Budaya Dance Troupe of Indonesia, 1976; Hungarian State Folk Ensemble, 1977; Moiseyew USSR State Folk Dance Ensemble, 1978; Barelek Gadang Operette of Sumatra, 1980; Ballet Folklorico Magisterial Mexico, 1981; Southeast Asian Dance Troupe of Hong Kong, 1984; Chandrasehkar Dance Company, 1988; Chinese Folk Dances,1988; and National Dance Company of Korea, 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company, Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula choreographed many creative folk dances like <em><strong>Flight of the Idaw</strong></em>, a Cordillera dance suite; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/192\">&ldquo;Tagabili,&rdquo;</a> a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> story of vengeance; &ldquo;Indarapatra,&rdquo; <em><strong>The Many-colored Vinta</strong></em> or <em><strong>Muslim Mosaic</strong></em>, dances from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a>, and Sulu archipelago; <em><strong>Aires de Verbena</strong></em>, European dances in Philippine style and setting; and <em><strong>Halinhinan: Regional Variations</strong></em>, rustic dances of Christianized Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presentations of other folkloric groups like Bibak from Baguio, Darangan Cultural Dance Troupe from Marawi, Tambuli Cultural Troupe from Tawi-Tawi, and Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group typify the folkloric <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> style and selection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The repertoire of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2556\">Philippine Dance Company of New York</a>, founded in 1943 by Bruna P. Seril, is typical of Filipino folk dance groups in the United States and Europe.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\"><strong>Bayanihan Philippine National Dance Company</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/167\">Obusan, Ramon A.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2555\"><strong>Philippine Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\"><strong>Philippine Folk Dance Society</strong></a> (PFDS)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/191\">Reyes-Urtula, Lucrecia</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/184\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFG)</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Immensely popular in Spain, the dance was also immortalized by the French composers George Bizet, Alexis Emmanuel Chabrier, and Maurice Ravel.

		"text": "<p><strong>Hip-hop</strong> is a form of artistic and cultural expression, which uses four basic elements: namely, MC-ing or rap, DJ-ing or turntablism, graffiti writing or graf, and b-boying or breaking. Hip-hop started in the United States in the late 1960s as a way of expressing dissatisfaction, protest, and rage against extreme conditions of poverty, racism, street violence, gang wars, and state neglect. The youth in the inner cities or ghettoes of the United States&rsquo; East Coast, particularly in the South Bronx, were among its first performers. Battling or competition in the streets&mdash;which serve as locations for production, exhibition/performance of hip-hop&mdash;uses hip-hop&rsquo;s four basic elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>B-boying</strong> or <strong>breaking</strong> is the dance element of hip-hop. DJ Kool Herc is known to have coined the terms &ldquo;breaking&rdquo; to refer to the hip-hop dance and &ldquo;breaker&rdquo; to refer to practitioners of this type of dance. Contrary to the misconception that breaking derived its name from the bone-breaking acrobatic techniques and power moves that combine the fluidity of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a> and funk, the agility of martial arts, and the athleticism of gymnastics, hip-hop dance is called breaking because the breaker or the B(reak)-boy/B(reak)-girl used to dance the &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; or the temporary suspension of all instrumentations except for the last beat in a song. Later, when these breaks were looped and played over and over again by the DJ or spinner, extended beat breaks came to be known as <strong>breakbeats</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, breakers used the dance to prevent street violence, which was rampant in the inner cities. Gang wars were translated into dance or <strong>break battles</strong>. Thus, winning in dance battles meant gaining respect in the streets and transforming the streets into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">dance spaces</a>. This also meant claiming the city and the right to a space which the State had taken away from the poor African-American communities, as well as Latino and Asian migrants who were relegated to the inner cities. Breaking also served as an expression of resistance against studio-produced dances like jazz and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> that were not accessible to the members of poor communities, because classes were too expensive and the techniques too stiff, confined, and commercial. Some of the pioneer breakers include the Crazy Commandos, Rock Steady Crew, and the Dynamic Rockers which dominated the streets of New York in the early 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with other elements of hip-hop, breaking/b-boying is a combination, reinvention, reworking, and a sampling of numerous styles and vocabularies from jazz, salsa, boogie woogie, martial arts, gymnastics, acrobatics, and indigenous dances from all over the world. The different &ldquo;schools&rdquo; of hip-hop dances&mdash;from the rocking style rampant in the East Coast, to the LA style characterized by popping and locking which was supposedly developed in the West Coast, to the new jack swing of New York, and finally to the power moves of Asians predominantly executed by Korean and Chinese b-boys/b-girls&mdash;prove that the DNA of hip-hop dance is hybrid in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking/b-boying&rsquo;s history in the United States is clearly rooted in the underground and cultural resistance movement of hip-hop, and it was only later on that the tension between manufactured <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/778\">hip-hop music</a>/rap and underground hip-hop culture created rifts amongst its practitioners. In the Philippines, however, these two almost conflicting cultures of hip-hop dance, namely, the street/underground and commercial/manufactured, were almost simultaneously introduced through two streams of information dissemination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first was through the influx of American forms of music, including hip-hop in the late 1970s and 1980s, which came with the wave of the American <em>balikbayan</em> (Filipinos visiting from abroad) or Fil-Ams (Filipino Americans) who learned and participated in hip-hop culture as migrants in the United States. Upon returning or visiting the Philippines, they brought with them the underground hip-hop culture and some of its corresponding music and movies like <em><strong>Wild Style</strong></em> in 1982, <em><strong>Beat Street</strong></em>, <em><strong>Body Rock</strong></em>, and <em><strong>Breakin&rsquo;</strong></em> in 1984, and <em><strong>Krush Groove</strong></em> in 1985. The second way by which hip-hop became popular in the country was through the numerous dance shows that were patterned after the famous American music and dance television show called <em><strong>Soul Train</strong></em>. Two dance and music programs that dominated Philippine television in the 1980s, <em><strong>Penthouse 7</strong></em> and <em><strong>Disco Rama</strong></em>, featured popping and locking techniques closely identified with the famous West Coast hip-hop pioneer breakers Sugar Pop and Poppin&rsquo; Feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The need to notate some of the basic vocabulary of breaking/b-boying became apparent with the establishment of numerous dance studios and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">companies</a> offering hip-hop classes and embedding hip-hop genre in their repertoire, the proliferation of Internet tutorials on breaking, and the influence of hip-hop dance competitions all over the world. The dance form has acquired more or less a set of terms adapted from underground practices of breaking. <strong>Rocking</strong> or <strong>grooving</strong>, usually done at the start of a breakdance session, allows the dancer to get a feel of the beat patterns of the music. The dance move employs either a side-to-side <strong>swagger</strong> or an up-and-down <strong>bobbin&rsquo;</strong> of the upper torso and the head. <strong>Top rock</strong> is a breakdance movement that serves as preparation for more intense and acrobatic movements. <strong>Down rock</strong> or <strong>floor rock</strong> is another breakdance movement done with the hand/arm/head or body on the floor to demonstrate the breaker&rsquo;s skill in weight shifts, control, and agility. <strong>Up rock</strong> is a competitive breakdance move that consists of shuffling, turns, and spins.&nbsp;<strong>Freeze&nbsp;</strong>/&nbsp;<strong>Stall&nbsp;</strong>/&nbsp;<strong>Air Move</strong> is a pose or stationary power move that focuses on body control and strength as the most skillful freezes, usually suspending off the floor, using a specific body part such as the arm, hand, or head.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the core of a b-boy routine are power moves similar to gymnastic movements characterized by speed, momentum, and athleticism. There are several types of power moves. <strong>Spin</strong> could refer to a <strong>back spin</strong>, <strong>shoulder spin</strong>, <strong>hand spin</strong>, <strong>head spin</strong>, or <strong>air chair spin</strong>. <strong>Handstands</strong> demonstrate the breakers&rsquo; sense of balance and body control as they stand on their hands for extended periods of time while shifting from one body or leg pose to another. <strong>Floats</strong> could include <strong>crickets</strong>, <strong>hydro</strong>, <strong>jackhammer</strong>, <strong>lotus jackhammer</strong>, <strong>super jackhammer</strong>, <strong>darkhammer</strong>, <strong>hopping turtles</strong>, <strong>UFO</strong>, <strong>boomerangs</strong>, <strong>gorillas</strong>, <strong>gremlins spins</strong>, while <strong>Buddha spins</strong> are usually done with the body fixed while the hands move. <strong>Swipe</strong>, such as <strong>one-handed swipe</strong>, <strong>air swipe</strong>, or <strong>headslide swipe</strong>, is an upside-down power move wherein the breakers make&nbsp;a 360-degree turn using the momentum of their suspended legs while they land on their hands. <strong>Windmill</strong>, which could be a <strong>mummy</strong>, <strong>nutcracker</strong>, <strong>handcuff</strong>, or <strong>bellymill</strong>, is spinning on the floor without using the arms and almost purely dependent on the momentum created by the turning legs and bouncing mid- or upper torso. <strong>Flare</strong>&mdash;<strong>chair flare</strong>, <strong>one-handed flare</strong>, <strong>sandwich flare</strong>, <strong>lotus flare</strong>, or <strong>thread flare</strong>&mdash;is a gymnastic move that uses the arms to balance the suspended body while the body and the legs move side-to-side without touching the floor. Other basic movements that constitute the vocabulary of hip-hop are <strong>krumping</strong>, a move that is free, expressive, and often angry; <strong>locking</strong>, a sharp transition movement between multiple freezes; and <strong>popping</strong> or movements similar to mime, creating a stop-and-go motion effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The form may have originated in the cities of America but its presence has been strongly felt in the parks of Metro Manila and other provinces in the northern and southern parts of the Philippines. Interesting innovations of breakers include combining hip-hop styles with local dance moves.

		"text": "<p><strong>Itik-Itik</strong> is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic dance</a> that is said to originate in Leyte, a province in the Visayas. The dancer&rsquo;s arms, usually folded in, with his or her hands at chest level, mimic the flapping wings of a duck, <em>itik</em> in Filipino, and his or her feet glide or shuffle to copy the bird&rsquo;s waddling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a>, itik-itik has its roots in <strong>sibay</strong>, a Visayan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/45\">bird dance</a>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1551\">folk legend</a> says that the term became popular in Surigao, a province at the southern part of the country, after &ldquo;a young lady called Kanang (a nickname for Cayetana) who was considered the best dancer and singer of her time, was asked to dance the sibay. She became so enthusiastic and spirited during the performance that she began to improvise movements and steps similar to the movements of ducks as they walk with short, choppy steps and splash water over their backs while calling to the mates&rdquo; (Reyes-Aquino 1996, 28). Those who saw her loved the way she danced and started to imitate her movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Itik-Itik is performed as a group dance during town festivities and other social gatherings. There is no limit to the number of couples who can participate. Partners do not touch at anytime; for demonstrations, partners usually stand about six feet apart. Female dancers wear either a <em>camisa</em> or <em>kimona</em> with a kerchief over one shoulder, paired with a <em>patadyong</em> (tubular skirt). Male dancers, on the other hand, don the barong tagalog or <em>camisa de chino</em> and trousers. Later, in the staging of folkloric performances, the girls were attired in a one-piece <em>balintawak</em> (butterfly-sleeved top) with a kerchief usually in black and yellow checkered pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common footwork is done with one foot leading. The dancer steps forward with the heel of one foot (to imitate a duck&rsquo;s foot), then slides the other foot behind it; he or she takes a small step with the ball of the first foot, and again slides the other foot close behind. The rondalla music that accompanies the dance is upbeat in 3/4 measure, and both the arm movements and the footwork are springy, giving the dance a lighthearted, playful feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Itik-Itik belongs to the nature/wildlife motif of local dances which &ldquo;mimics the ways of birds, insects, fish, reptiles, and so forth&rdquo; (Orosa-Goquingco 1980, 224).

The <a href=\"/9/73/1551\">folk legend</a> says that the term became popular in Surigao, a province at the southern part of the country, after &#x201C;a young lady called Kanang (a nickname for Cayetana) who was considered the best dancer and singer of her time, was asked to dance the sibay. She became so enthusiastic and spirited during the performance that she began to improvise movements and steps similar to the movements of ducks as they walk with short, choppy steps and splash water over their backs while calling to the mates&#x201D; (Reyes-Aquino 1996, 28). Those who saw her loved the way she danced and started to imitate her movements."

Male dancers, on the other hand, don the barong tagalog or <em>camisa de chino</em> and trousers.

The rondalla music that accompanies the dance is upbeat in 3/4 measure, and both the arm movements and the footwork are springy, giving the dance a lighthearted, playful feel."

The canaries used to be about death and only later about love and courtship (Buckman 1978, 87).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The jota itself is a couple dance performed to a song called <em>cuartela</em>, a four-line stanza of eight syllables to a line, and castanets. The Aragonese claim the dance; it is derived from the Andalusian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>fandango</strong></a> and was brought to Aragon by the exiled poet, Aben Jot. Its steps are &ldquo;rapid hops, springs and athletic foot work&rdquo; (Buckman 1978, 258), or more specifically, a jump into <strong>matalarana</strong> or a leap landing on one foot while pointing the other, followed by a <strong>pas de bourrie natural</strong>, a transitional travelling step (La Meri 1948, 163).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are perhaps hundreds of jotas in the Philippines, not all <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documented</a> and some newly concocted for special occasions.

In Zambales, the <strong>jota cabangan</strong>, also called the <strong>jota sinansinan</strong>, is done on the eve of a wedding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>la jota San Joaquin</strong> from Iloilo and the famous <strong>la jota moncade&ntilde;a</strong> from the town of Moncada in Tarlac are done to the rhythm of bamboo castanets. The moncade&ntilde;a is unique for a passage called <strong>patay</strong> or <strong>desmayo</strong>, where the man and woman seem to commiserate with and console each other in a funereal tempo. The <strong>jota bicolana</strong> uses a decorative fan, while the Ilocano <strong>jota zapatilla</strong> is done to the clatter of women&rsquo;s footwear. As in the <strong>la jota yogad</strong>, the men wear&nbsp;<em>chinelas&nbsp;</em>or closed slippers. The <strong>cabangan</strong> mimes courtship, lovers whispering by windows and secretly touching each other&rsquo;s feet under the table. The <strong>jota ha kalipay</strong> (jota of happiness) from Samar is done by just one couple or <strong>amenudo</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jotas are usually done by enough pairs to make up a quadrille, or even more. Regardless of the number of the couples, most of the figures involve meeting at the center, changing places, circling together as pairs, or a&nbsp;<em>cadenza&nbsp;</em>(small chain) as in the <strong>jota Rizal</strong> from Batangas. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a> <strong>la jota filipina</strong> from Lal-lo, Cagayan, specifies its figures as <strong>pasakalye</strong> (meaning intermission), originally related to the <strong>chaconne</strong> (a preclassic dance in triple time), <strong>benya</strong> (bowing), <strong>poppo</strong> (clapping), and <strong>buelta</strong> (turning).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clapping is done in the <strong>jotabal</strong> of Quezon, the <strong>la jota</strong> of Camarines Norte, the <strong>la jota concordiana</strong> of Iloilo, and the la jota filipina. Clapping is paralleled by <strong>panadyak</strong> (stamping) in the <strong>jota batangue&ntilde;a</strong>, the la jota and jota bicolana from Bicol, the <strong>a la jota</strong> and <strong>jota italiana</strong> from Laguna, the <strong>jota Pangasinan</strong>, the <strong>la jota samare&ntilde;a</strong>, the la jota from Negros Occidental, the jota Rizal, and the jotabal. In the <strong>jota gumaque&ntilde;a</strong>, there is also clicking of heels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the jotas employ sway-balance, waltz, and waltz-turn steps. <strong>Korriti</strong> (mincing) is done in jota batangue&ntilde;a and <strong>jota paloana</strong> from Leyte. The characteristic Bicolano <strong>enga&ntilde;o</strong> step, which is similar to the sway-balance, is done in the <strong>jota rojana</strong>; the typically Visayan <strong>espunti</strong> step, or the shuffle on one foot while pointing the other, in the <strong>laota</strong> and the <strong>ese-ese</strong> step, also Visayan, and consisting of three steps and a stamp, in the <strong>la jota San Joaquin</strong>; the Ilocano <strong>mudansa</strong> or oblique steps with heel brushes in the la jota from Paoay, Ilocos Norte; and the <strong>piang-piang</strong> or sliding quarter turns in the jota ha kalipay. Some jotas employ the <strong>sarok</strong> or crossing feet and arms with body bent, cross-step, step-swing, step-brush (often with a hop), and a variety of turns. Some of these steps may lead to a <strong>do-si-do</strong> or changing places in a small square or back to back as in the jota Pangasinan, jota Rizal, and laota, or to a regular ballroom hold as in the <strong>jota cagayana</strong> and the jota Pangasinan. Some jotas employ other hand gestures besides clapping such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong>kumintang</strong></a> or wrist circling and <strong>salok</strong> or scooping down with one hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most jotas are named after their places of origin, such as the <strong>jota Navarra</strong>, originally from Spain and now called jota paloana in Leyte. Depending on the region, the women dancers are dressed in&nbsp;<em>maria clara&nbsp;</em>(native gown), the Ilocano costume&nbsp;<em>mascota&nbsp;</em>(tailless, floral-print skirt), or even&nbsp;<em>patadyong&nbsp;</em>(barrel skirt).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many other popular jota: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> <strong>manile&ntilde;a</strong>, <strong>cavite&ntilde;a</strong> and <strong>mindore&ntilde;a</strong>; the <strong>jota de Olongapo</strong> from Zambales and the <strong>jota ecijana</strong> from Nueva Ecija; the Ilocos Norte <strong>vintarina</strong>, <strong>sarrate&ntilde;a</strong>, and <strong>laoague&ntilde;a</strong>; and the <strong>sevillana</strong> from Iloilo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The European triple tempo agreed so much with Filipinos that the jota spread throughout the country. The jota de Olongapo shows influences of the American square dance. The jota marks special occasions, such as fiestas, weddings, and baptisms. But they also have deeper implications when danced during the&nbsp;<em>guling-guling</em>, the mardi gras on the day before Ash Wednesday, or the&nbsp;<em>tambora&nbsp;</em>which is held on Christmas eve.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2621\">Basilio Esteban S.

Each warrior wields a&nbsp;<em>pinnang&nbsp;</em>or hand axe in one hand and a&nbsp;<em>kalasag&nbsp;</em>or shield in the other. A&nbsp;<em>tufay&nbsp;</em>or spear is sometimes used, instead of an axe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance begins with the entrance of the male musicians doing the <strong>sikwat</strong> or hopping on the left then the right foot, with the heels alternately raised backward.

		"text": "<p><strong>Kumintang</strong> is the name given to several distinct styles, techniques, and forms of music and dance originating in the areas now known as Batangas, a province in the heartland of the Southern Tagalog region. Early 19th-century travelers&rsquo; accounts often mention the kumintang as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> <em>chant national</em>, describing them as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/97\">dance-songs</a> performed by pairs of men and women, with texts concerning love and courtship.

It is also a step combination in time standardized in Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a>. The term is derived from <em>kurandang</em>, literally meaning showy or overdressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movement is composed of a rhythmic change step&mdash;one foot steps diagonally forward, the other foot displaces it at the rear, and the first foot steps forward again all in two counts, and with a step across by the second foot to carry the weight on the third count. This combination is also done diagonally backwards, i.e., in reverse, but with pointing across the second foot, instead of a transfer of weight. A Visayan variety from Iloilo does the combination with hops, leg swings, and body twists, but set in duple time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As a full dance with many variations, the kuradang is done during fiestas and occasions like weddings, mainly in the Visayas.

Another one, native to Loboc, Bohol, is similar but makes use of complex combinations of step-hops, two-foot jumps, parallel <strong>tortiller</strong> (a kind of sideway shuffling), and stamping embellishment. There are also contrasting steps for separate couples, simultaneously done in one figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Samar, the kuradang is made up of waltz steps, done with or without the normal ballroom-dancing hold (face to face) and without specified formation. Another Samar kuradang was recorded in Villareal by Juan C. Miel: a &ldquo;ballroom folk dance,&rdquo; it is made up of waltz steps elaborated on with sway balances, hops, cross steps (a foot crossing over), and turns. It is accompanied by a song sung by onlookers and is about the solicitude of one &ldquo;Inday&rdquo; (a common Visayan name for girls and young women) who is compared to a shady tree or prized chick coveted by a hawk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A kuradang in 2/4 time from Pototan, Iloilo, uses the Visayan step combination above, with much clapping from the dancers.

		"text": "<p><strong>Kuratsa</strong>, aka <strong>curacha</strong>, is an indigenized form of the <em>la cucaracha&nbsp;</em>(the cockroach), a Mexican <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship dance</a>. It is believed to have been introduced by Mexican soldiers and traders when Mexico had administrative and trade relations with the Philippines. However, it is also very different from its Mexican counterpart in both music and movement. Based on the movement patterns of kuratsa, the dance form is believed to be a descendant of the <strong>kigal</strong> or <strong>quigal</strong> aka <strong>binanug</strong> described by Jesuit missionary Francisco Ignacio de Alzina in <em><strong>Historia de las Islas e Indios de Bisayas</strong></em>, 1668. Kigal is a courtship dance that mimics the mating of birds like the chicken and the hawk. Kuratsa&rsquo;s movements suggest teasing and flirtation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The music used in all Visayan versions is similar, in two parts and 3/4 time. Speed may vary, depending on the style and ability of the dancers. With agile dancers, the sway balance is performed with a brush or a hop. Cross and waltz turns are done briskly. Chasing steps accent the dance figures. The woman performs movements to attract her partner, while the man responds in kind. Depending on the artistry and skill of the dancing couple, the couple improvises combinations based on the basic movements of kuratsa. All versions contain the varied dance movements in accordance with the mood, inspiration, and cultural practices of the dancers. It is danced during weddings, baptismal celebrations, birthdays, and fiestas. There are as many versions of the kuratsa as there are localities that learned and adopted it as their own. The earliest of the kuratsa recorded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> was popular in Leyte and was called <strong>kuratsa visaya</strong>. Other kuratsa versions were later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documented</a> from other Visayan regions: <strong>kuratsa boholana</strong> from Bohol; <strong>kuratsa bago</strong>, <strong>kuratsa pulupandan</strong>, and <strong>kuratsa Bacolod</strong> from Negros Occidental; and <strong>kuratsa Iloilo</strong> from New Lucena, Iloilo. There are also kuratsa variants in Antique, namely <strong>kuratsa Culasi</strong>, <strong>kuratsa Hamtic</strong>, <strong>kuratsa San Jose</strong>, <strong>kuratsa Tibiao</strong>, and <strong>kuratsa antique&ntilde;a</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The version in Samar known as <strong>kuratsa samare&ntilde;a</strong> is similar to the antique&ntilde;a, where the bride and groom / performers are showered with coins or have <em>gala</em> or gifts of paper pinned on their holiday clothes. Kuratsa samare&ntilde;a is usually done <strong>amenudo</strong> (by a couple), with music that has five parts apart from an introduction and a finale. Both musicans and spectators sing during the fifth part of the accompaniment. A typical song performed in the kuratsa samare&ntilde;a is the &ldquo;Abalulay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p>Abalulay, Abalulay</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Linguid-linguid hinen baybay</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kon igkita ka hin away</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dalagan ayaw pa patay</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abalulay, Abalulay</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Abalulay, Abalulay</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sailing closely to the shore</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you encounter a quarrel</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Run away, don&rsquo;t get killed</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abalulay, Abalulay)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Samar, the female dancer dons a <em>patadyong</em> (tubular skirt) and a <em>camisa</em> (a full skirt), a <em>kimono</em> (loose blouse with short or 3/4 sleeves), and <em>alampay</em> (scarf). The male dancer sports the barong tagalog with white pair of pants, or a <em>camisa de chino</em> matched with colored trousers. For formal occasions, the female garment is a <em>mestiza</em> dress and the male <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume</a> consists of barong tagalog and black trousers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kuratsa Iloilo specifies three figures in all six: <strong>haylo</strong>, <strong>estelo</strong> (where the man tries to block the woman&rsquo;s way and gestures pleadingly), and <strong>padayao-dayao</strong> (literally, &ldquo;to praise&rdquo;). The hamtic specifies four figures in all seven: <strong>remate</strong>, <strong>pundo-pundo</strong>, <strong>ese-ese</strong>, and <strong>bayong-bayong</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is only one type documented outside the Visayas: the <strong>kuratsa Paoay</strong> of Ilocos Norte. There, it is finished off with the characteristic <strong>ariquenquen</strong> dance, and its music shifts from triple to duple time. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> kuratsa starts very slowly in the execution of cross steps, moving forward and backward, with hands on waist and holding the skirt. As the dance progresses, the music goes faster, until the dance ends with coquettish gestures, such as an exaggerated hip movement or a slight raising of the skirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kuratsa is more identified with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>, who consider it as the most popular dance among people from all classes. The dance is not formally taught to local children in the community but passed on naturally by social practice. In the Waray region, a fiesta is incomplete without the <strong>sarayaw</strong> or dance festival where kuratsa is the highlight. Kuratsa has also been used by politicians for their promotional campaigns. Although the dance is common to all social levels, the kuratsa performance, especially during grand public events, is the venue for the politicians and political aspirants to show off their dancing talent and their <em>gala</em> or the money thrown during performance. Since the dance, by nature, raises funds, the highlight of the sarayaw is the kuratsa performed by politicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent times, changes were introduced to the movement vocabulary of kuratsa with the incorporation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\">hip-hop</a> and other invented movements derived from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> and other genres. Moreover, the kuratsa today has become a musical form separate from the dance. Waray artists like Art Ramasasa have composed and experimented on the music that traditionally accompanied the dancing. The lyrics have also changed through time, incorporating current issues and sociocultural changes.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2603\">Carmen T.

With agile dancers, the sway balance is performed with a brush or a hop. Cross and waltz turns are done briskly. Chasing steps accent the dance figures. The woman performs movements to attract her partner, while the man responds in kind. Depending on the artistry and skill of the dancing couple, the couple improvises combinations based on the basic movements of kuratsa. All versions contain the varied dance movements in accordance with the mood, inspiration, and cultural practices of the dancers. It is danced during weddings, baptismal celebrations, birthdays, and fiestas. There are as many versions of the kuratsa as there are localities that learned and adopted it as their own. The earliest of the kuratsa recorded by <a href=\"/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> was popular in Leyte and was called <strong>kuratsa visaya</strong>.

In the Waray region, a fiesta is incomplete without the <strong>sarayaw</strong> or dance festival where kuratsa is the highlight. Kuratsa has also been used by politicians for their promotional campaigns. Although the dance is common to all social levels, the kuratsa performance, especially during grand public events, is the venue for the politicians and political aspirants to show off their dancing talent and their <em>gala</em> or the money thrown during performance. Since the dance, by nature, raises funds, the highlight of the sarayaw is the kuratsa performed by politicians."

Moreover, the kuratsa today has become a musical form separate from the dance. Waray artists like Art Ramasasa have composed and experimented on the music that traditionally accompanied the dancing. The lyrics have also changed through time, incorporating current issues and sociocultural changes.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span></strong>"

		"text": "<p>The <strong>lanceros</strong>, short for a ballroom dance called <strong>quadrille des landers</strong>, is a quadrille in 2/4 or 6/8 or in combination. It was created in 1817 by John Duval, a Dublin master, two years after the introduction of the quadrille to England from Paris by Lady Jersey. He published the descriptions of the figures <strong>la dorset</strong>, <strong>lodoiska</strong>, <strong>la native</strong>, <strong>les graces</strong>, and <strong>les landers</strong> in the <em><strong>Dublin Evening Post</strong></em>. It was first danced at the grand ball of the Countess of Farnham on 9 Apr 1817, to music by Spagnoletti and Yaniewicz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the quadrille, the steps of the lanceros were originally complex and difficult. Eventually, these were simplified into walking steps. With the popularity of the waltz, the figures were waltzed to current music from musicals, operettas, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operas</a>. This gave rise to the lively <strong>kitchen lancers</strong>, where the ladies were swung off their feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Joseph Hart published <em><strong>Les Lanciers, a Second Set of Lanciers</strong></em> in 1820, with similar figures and composers used by Duval. It was introduced in London by students of Sacre, a fashionable teaching mistress. In 1836, Laborde introduced the lanceros in Paris. In 1957, a Prussian court <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> performed the dance costumed in the uniform of cavalry lancers. By the 1850s, the dance had become prominent. The dance eventually found its way to the Philippines through Spain, or possibly later, during the American occupation. Its name was changed to lanceros. To date, there are three <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documented dances</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>lanceros de Pagsanjan</strong> in Laguna is performed as a quadrille and is popular in many regions. The figures simulate an American square dance called lancers, but it is less like an American square dance, and more like English lancers or the Philippine <strong>rigodon</strong>. The participants elegantly walk the <strong>saludo</strong>, <strong>chuchillada grande</strong>, <strong>chuchillada peque&ntilde;a</strong>, <strong>desaire</strong>, <strong>visita</strong>, and <strong>cadena</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>lanceros de Tayabas</strong> was performed as a divertissement in the <em>komedya</em> of Tayabas, Quezon. Danced primarily in the quadrille formation, this lanceros uniquely integrates the use of fans for the ladies and panama hats for the gentlemen in the execution of the different figures in the dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>lanceros de Lingayen</strong> is also done in quadrille formation and incorporates Spanish and French influences, imitating the movements of the lancers. In Pangasinan, the hands are held in the <strong>kewet</strong> position. Four figures use walking steps. It incorporates typical Filipino dance patterns and steps, such as clapping while a partner walks and turns, kneeling and holding one hand while a partner walks around, turning under the arch of joined hands, <strong>jaleo</strong> (solo), change steps, gallops, heel places, <strong>do-si-do</strong>, foot stamping, and whirl-turns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>lanceros de Negros</strong> of Silay was also popular in Luzon and other parts of the Visayas in the Spanish era and as prominent as the <strong>rigodon</strong>. It is danced in longways formation. The first figure has walking steps in various directions. It proceeds with changing steps, <strong>brincos con puntillas</strong>, <strong>brincos con vueltas</strong>, gallops, three-step turns, and whirl turns. It is uncertain whether the lanceros de Lingayen and the lanceros de Negros are examples of different stages in the development of the lanceros, or whether they are adaptations, or a combination of both.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2480\">Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Alejandro, Reynaldo Gamboa, and Amanda Abad Santos-Gana. 2002. <em>Sayaw: Philippine Dances</em>.

It is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">martial dance</a> still popular among community celebrations in the Sulu archipelago. It is practiced by men and women&mdash;alone, in pairs, or in groups. The term &ldquo;langka,&rdquo; when affixed to the name of a traditional martial art form in Sulu and Tawi-Tawi, suggests a playful and frolicsome imitation or interpretation of such martial form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The usually empty-handed performer normally begins with a greeting or obeisance. The square-line direction of movement, postures, and gestures closely resemble those of the martial art forms of Malaysia and Indonesia. It is infused with dance-like qualities, with movements that vary from slow and flowing, to graceful and angular.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many variants of the langka. <strong>Langka kuntaw</strong> is the Tausug-Sama (aka Samal) art of self-defense. The <strong>kuntaw</strong> or <strong>kuntao</strong> martial art form originates from Fukien, China and found its way into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> martial art tradition characterized by nimble footwork and low stances for quick maneouvers. Jumps, kicks, and deep knee bends are combined with precise, forceful arm movements similar to the movements in Japanese karate, Chinese kung-fu, and the <strong>lai-ka</strong> of the Shan States of Burma.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Langka lima</strong> is a Sama-Tausug martial dance variation of five slow-paced movements or stances punctuated by the artful use of a bladed weapon, like&nbsp;a <em>barung</em> or a <em>kris</em>, before a momentary pose at the end of each defense stance. A kerchief, sometimes wielded by the performer, further accentuates the gestures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Langka silat</strong>, performed throughout the Sulu archipelago, is characterized by a fast-paced but more relaxed and flowing movement compared to the langka kuntaw. It may be done as a solo performance with a sequence of movements, or with many opponents but with a set of stances and postures. The langka silat has a close affinity with the <strong>bersilat</strong>, an ancient art of self-defense, probably of Sumatran origin, and taught and practiced throughout Indonesia and Malaysia for over 400 years. <strong>Langka pansak</strong> is another variant that focuses on achieving perfection in the postures and stances. Execution of each sequence of movements is deliberately slow and ends with a short pause to transition into the next sequence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>magsangkil</strong> is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> fight dance. The dancers carry spears and fish-shaped shields made of tightly woven rattan. Meanwhile, <strong>langka sayaw</strong> is an exciting Sama dance from Sibutu, Tawi-Tawi. The two opponents dance carrying a <strong>budjak</strong> or lance, and a <strong>taming</strong> or a round shield. Fighters first appraise each other from a distance, then approach each other to execute both attack and defense techniques in a continuous manner until their weapons and shields are laid on the ground. To outsmart each other, the dancers may try kicking sand on each other&rsquo;s face in order to get their weapons back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a dance form, the langka may be integrated into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong> or <strong>igal</strong></a> with spectacular results, as in the <strong>langka baluang</strong> or martial dance characterized by the movements of an angry monkey. <strong>Langka budjang</strong> is the only martial dance version for women with complete sequences from obeisance to the square line direction of stances and ending bow. The sculptural postures and gestures belie the restrained force of the thrusts. Movements involve kicks, jumps, fluid arm movements punctuated with clapping and slapping motions and sounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A female dancer usually wears a <strong>sablay</strong> (loose blouse) paired with a <strong>sawwal kantiu</strong> (loose trousers) for ease of movement. For the same reason, a male performer wears a <strong>badju</strong> (loose shirt) usually of white cotton fabric and a sawwal kantiu of batik or printed cotton fabric. However, the tight-fitting <strong>sawwal kuput</strong> shows the dancer&rsquo;s postures to the best advantage. The usual male accessory is a pis or scarf wrapped around the head or placed on the shoulder, or a <strong>kuppiya</strong> (headpiece) which may be embroidered, or made of some rich fabric, like velvet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The langka or martial dance is performed to the fast rhythm of a single percussive instrument like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\"><em>agung</em></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\"><em>tambol</em></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\"><em>gandang</em></a>, and <em>tuntung</em>. The agung is a deep brass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a> played with a beater covered with rubber to protect the instrument and to produce a pleasing sound. The tambol is a metal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a> with animal skin played with a stick. The gandang is a wooden drum played with bare hands on both ends, fastened on the neck with a piece of cloth, or tucked under one leg. The tuntung is the smallest gong in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\"><em>kulintangan</em></a>. For more formal occasions when a kulintangan ensemble is available, kulintangan music is used for accompaniment.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\"><strong><strong><strong>Ligaya</strong> Fernando Amilbangsa</strong></strong></a>, with notes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

The langka silat has a close affinity with the <strong>bersilat</strong>, an ancient art of self-defense, probably of Sumatran origin, and taught and practiced throughout Indonesia and Malaysia for over 400 years. <strong>Langka pansak</strong> is another variant that focuses on achieving perfection in the postures and stances. Execution of each sequence of movements is deliberately slow and ends with a short pause to transition into the next sequence."

		"text": "<p>The <strong>lunsay</strong> is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/97\">song dance</a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2354\">Jama Mapun</a>, one of the indigenous groups that populate Tawi-Tawi province in the Sulu Archipelago. An intricate dance, it is the only one in the Philippines accompanied by communal singing, the usual theme of which is love. Lunsay reflects the natural environment of the Jama Mapun: the movement of sea waves, the waxing and waning of the moon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the villagers, young and old, married and single men and women, participate in this night-long dance. The singing and dancing may take place inside a house or in any open space. Performers are free to fall in or out of the dance circle or spiral to eat, rest, or greet newcomers. The people&rsquo;s voluntary participation as spectator and/or performer sustains the lunsay session all through the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance is performed on the <em>lakapan lapis&nbsp;</em>or floor matting made of wide bamboo slats. The bamboo matting, when placed on the ground or floor, produces clapping sounds under the impact of dancing feet, a special effect essential to the dance, which is alternately fast and slow. But even without the lakapan lapis, the feet stomping on bare surface also produce the engaging percussion that harmonizes with the singing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lunsay formation is either a circle or a spiral of handholding dancers; the inner coil is always occupied by the women. The male and female ends of the line do not hold hands directly but use a yellow kerchief, a stick, or a piece of string to link hands. The dance invariably starts with the slow movement (clockwise or step-left), matched by plaintive singing. When the singing is accelerated, the steps become vigorous and the movement direction changes to counterclockwise or step-right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intricacy of lunsay lies in the fact that lunsay singing is done simultaneously with the dancing, and has different melodic patterns that pertain to specific movements dominated by footwork. A tune from any of the six types of songs intoned by the men is always repeated and echoed by the women, but with appropriate changes in the words so as not to reveal unacceptable thoughts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The singing begins with the slow <strong>tugilah</strong> or back and forth step, composed of eight phrases. The dancers move in a clockwise direction through footwork: step left foot sideward or forward and right foot stomps twice as it closes to left foot; then left foot steps forward followed by one right stomp behind left foot. Dancers sing while executing the movements:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p>Nilabuan tugilah lunsay na ba dumagsah</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Let us do the back and forth step, and start the lunsay)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nilabuan na kakasi lunsay maglamilami</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Let us love one another and have fun with the lunsay)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tagnaan ta na ba lunsay kaam siga ba malumbay</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Let&rsquo;s start the lunsay, you who are kind and considerate)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lamilami na ba nagnah kaam jama dambilah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Let&rsquo;s start the fun, you people from the other side of the community.)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Through a transition movement, the leader of a lunsay session may initiate the end of tugilah after an indefinite time of enjoyable group dancing. The first pattern of transition footwork consists of right foot stepping forward followed by a left foot swing, then left foot is placed backward and right foot closes to left foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the transition movement is established after several repetitions, the dancers sing the <strong>tinggayon 1</strong> or slow step 1, composed of four phrases. The dancers move in a counterclockwise direction through footwork that rises to a frenetic pace: stomp right foot sideward and close left foot to right foot. Then left foot stomps backward behind right foot and right foot steps close to left foot. The song that accompanies the dancing starts with a slow rhythm:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p>Tinggayon tinggayon doh battis pinaguyon doh</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Let&rsquo;s do the slow step and let&rsquo;s synchronize our steps)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaam takka bahau paantan nakam pitu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Those who just arrived, come hold our hands &hellip;)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The steps lead to a rising momentum until the leader ends the tinggayon with the second pattern of transition dance steps: left foot step forward with right foot swing; then right foot is placed behind and left foot closes to right foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third part of lunsay is <strong>nilabos</strong>, meaning &ldquo;to heighten performance,&rdquo; and composed of four phrases starting in slow rhythm. Footwork is in clockwise direction, accelerating from a slow pace: left foot sideward step, right foot crosses over left, and left foot closes to right foot. Again, the leader ends nilabos by initiating a transitional movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth melodic pattern is <strong>halin taroh</strong>, which means &ldquo;change the tune.&rdquo; This part has 12 phrases sung in fast tempo as dancers move counterclockwise stomping right foot sideward, followed by left foot closing to right foot. The simple but vigorous footwork builds up to a climax that leads to the second transition movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p>Halin taroh ba tunis na kaam siga gambina</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Let us change the tune, you beautiful ladies)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tattoh pakiyukiyum na</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Let us laugh and smile)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mangkin ba sinaglitan na.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Especially when you are praised)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The fifth part is <strong>palabu-labu</strong>, meaning &ldquo;swaying back and forth.&rdquo; This is also in a fast beat and in counterclockwise direction. The footwork creates the percussion with a pattern of step right foot sideward, stomp left foot close to right foot with bent knees. Then step left foot sideward and stomp the right foot twice close to the left foot with flexed knees. The singing and fast beat steps are repeated as many times as the performers please, until the leader does the second transition movement to lead to the next song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sixth part of lunsay is <strong>tinggayon 2</strong> or slow step 2 with 10 phrases in slow beat in clockwise motion starting with left foot sideward followed by a right foot swing forward. Then the right foot steps backward ending with a close-point of left foot to right foot. The footwork is repeated over and over until the leader ends it by doing the first transition dance steps. The whole group follows. The seventh part, <strong>moleh</strong>, meaning &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go home,&rdquo; is for the closing. The song has eight phrases in slow tempo. Dancers move clockwise by stepping left foot forward and right foot stomps close to left foot. Then right foot steps backward and left foot stomps close to right foot. The dance steps are repeated as many times until the community dancing succumbs to the slow down of energy leading to rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a spontaneous communal song dance, performers wear everyday garments when they dance the lunsay. But during celebratory gatherings, performers wear traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costumes</a>. Girls and women may wear <em>sablay</em> or loose blouse with <em>sawwal kantiu</em> (loose pants) or <em>patadjung</em> (tubular skirt). When worn with a <em>sawwal</em>, the <em>sablay</em> may go with a <em>siyag</em> or sash. Boys and men may wear the <em>badjuh-lapi</em> or the collarless tailored jacket with the sawwal kantiu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 21st century, obvious changes in the lunsay are demonstrated by the different melodies, and the mixing of male and female in the circular and spiral formations. Such changes are brought about by modernization, lack of proper transmission from the elders who still know the song dance, and the incursion of Malaysian culture. Cultural workers of Tawi-Tawi are aware of the need to preserve traditional art forms like the lunsay because of Mapun&rsquo;s propensity&mdash;due to its proximity to Sabah&mdash;to be taken over by Malaysian culture. Sabah is greatly acculturated by contemporary Malaysian culture, though the contested oil-rich territory is still considered to be under Philippine sovereignty.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\"><strong><strong><strong>Ligaya</strong> Fernando Amilbangsa</strong></strong></a>, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>mazurka</strong> is a dance in time from the Mazur or Mazowze of northeastern Poland. The 16th-century Polish <strong>mazur</strong>, <strong>mazurek</strong>, <strong>kujawiak</strong>, or <strong>oberek</strong> is deemed to be the matrix of today&rsquo;s mazurka. In the Philippine mazurka, the working foot is always close to the front or rear of the ankle of the hopping leg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three-part mazurka was danced to a song and a bagpipe and consisted of more than 100 figures developed through the imagination of dancers. Of the figures, the stamping, heel clicking, and turning as couples (<strong>holubiec</strong>) remained constant. In 3/4 or 6/8 time, it was usually danced by 8 to 16 couples in a circle, accompanied by national songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance spread swiftly throughout Europe in the 19th century. Gradually it became more refined, acquired new patterns and was renamed the mazurka. But though it finally had a name, it was outstanding for its indeterminate and undefined patterns. Henry Cellarius, a foremost dance master of his time, called it &ldquo;an independent and truly inspiring dance with no set format.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appeal of the mazurka extended to classical dance and music, as in Leo Delibes&rsquo;s <em><strong>Coppelia</strong></em>, Peter I. Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <em><strong>Swan Lake</strong></em>, and Frederic Chopin&rsquo;s <em><strong>Les Sylphides</strong></em>. Chopin redefined its Polish roots and composed over 50 mazurkas. Other composers like Mikhail Glinka and Karol Szymonowski were equally enamored with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the mazurka&rsquo;s place in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> remains secure, the vitality of the mazurka as a ballroom dance dwindled with the diminished creative energy of enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like most European dances, the mazurka was introduced to the Philippines during the Spanish regime.

They may be classified into animal dances which depict the movements and habits of animals on land, air, and water; and occupational dances which depict community activities such as planting, fishing, war, and headhunting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Birds have often inspired many animal dances among cultural groups. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>&nbsp;<strong>paypayto</strong> depicts the agitated movements of high-flying birds. A great number of indigenous and Christian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dances</a> depict the movements of various birds: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/106\"><strong>tinikling</strong></a> (<em>tikling&nbsp;</em>birds), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/60\"><strong>itik-itik</strong></a> (ducks), <strong>kalapati</strong> or <strong>sinalampati</strong> (doves), and <strong>pabo</strong> (turkeys). In the non-Christian south, the most common <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/45\">bird dance</a> is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> <strong>kadal blilah</strong>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> <strong>banog-banog</strong> features a young woman imitating the flight of a hawk by waving a kerchief. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> <strong>binanog</strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a> <strong>kinabuwa</strong> mimic the swooping movements of the eagle. The Manobo <strong>burbudsil</strong> (woodpecker) portrays the hornbill&rsquo;s solicitude for its young.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There are other animal dances, such as those that imitate the movements of butterflies as exemplified by Isabela&rsquo;s <strong>balamban</strong> and Sulu Archipelago&rsquo;s <strong>kaba-kaba</strong>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> of Zambales have a male dance that imitates the actions of a monkey while the <strong>tahing baila</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> of Basilan simulates the undulations of a fish in water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Filipino dances are based on the economic activities of the community. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> areas, <strong>buhay sa bukid</strong> (life on the farm) is a dance on the rice-planting cycle. <strong>Pagtatanim</strong> (rice planting) shows how tedious the work is, with the dancers bent forward the whole time, lightening their load by singing. <strong>Paggapas</strong> (harvesting) is danced when the palay is ready for harvest&mdash;an occasion for rejoicing especially if the harvest is bountiful. <strong>Paggiik</strong> (threshing) is done by treading barefoot on rice stalks or by striking them against a hard object. In the dance, which is also called <strong>paglulugas</strong> in provinces such as Laguna, the men flail their arms to simulate the swinging and striking of the rice stalks to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a> accompaniment. In the <strong>pahangin</strong> (winnowing), women toss the grains up and down with a shallow basket called&nbsp;<em>bilao</em>. <strong>Bayuhan</strong> (pounding rice) comes after the harvest. In social gatherings, young men and women are invited to participate. The men pound the rice to musical accompaniment, usually a guitar. Finally, the women do the winnowing while singing and dancing. In Bulacan, the dance <strong>katlo</strong> (by threes) is performed during harvest season on moonlit nights. The men customarily offer to pound rice wherever there are young ladies to court. The Blaan have the <strong>maral</strong>, a suite of dances depicting the stages in rice planting, namely: the <strong>mabah</strong> which depicts the farmer&rsquo;s search for the kaingin area; the <strong>almigo</strong> which depicts the clearing of the forest; the <strong>amla</strong> or the planting stage; and the <strong>kamto</strong> which shows women harvesting the rice. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> portray the sowing of seeds in <strong>mag-asik</strong>, dancing around a large handkerchief.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kin-naras</strong> is a dance from&nbsp;Cabugao, Ilocos Sur&nbsp;depicting the various ways of catching fish. It is a graceful dance, allowing the dancers to show off their skill in trapping and catching fish with their bare hands. From Camiling, Zambales&nbsp;is another fishing dance called <strong>sala ti alat</strong> (fish container), performed after a successful fishing expedition. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> perform the <strong>mananagat</strong> which depicts in pantomime the work of fisherfolk. This long-formation dance features the male dancers carrying paddles and the women carrying bamboo scoops. The women scoop water out of an imaginary banca, and the men paddle. Catbalogan, Samar&nbsp;abounds in fish and other marine products. The <strong>an labasero</strong> (fresh-fish vendor) depicts the simple fisherfolk who, after vending fish, merrily dance on their way home. A good sale becomes an occasion for merrymaking, eating, and dancing until the next morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>maglalatik</strong> was evolved in the coconut-rich southern Luzon provinces, especially Laguna. The word comes from&nbsp;<em>latik</em>, the residue from boiled coconut milk. After the huskers finish their work, they drink and have fun. Using coconut shells attached to various parts of the body as percussive implements, they strike each other&rsquo;s bodies with shells held in the hand. The dance is supposed to be one version of the dance drama <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/458\"><strong>moros y cristianos</strong></a>, a choreographed battle between Moors and Christians.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Visayan <strong>mananguete</strong> depicts the stages of <em>tuba&nbsp;</em>(coconut wine) making. The dance starts with the sharpening of the&nbsp;<em>sangot&nbsp;</em>(scythe), then goes on to cleaning the&nbsp;<em>kawit&nbsp;</em>(bamboo container), climbing the coconut tree, extracting the sap, squeezing and straining the sap, and finally tasting the tuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bicol</a> <strong>pinuhag</strong> demonstrates the work of a honey collector, so does the <strong>pulot panilan</strong> of the Aeta. Another Bicol dance is <strong>pabirik</strong>, which imitates gold panning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> of Paoay, Ilocos Norte, who are noted for weaving a fine cotton cloth called <em>abel</em>, relax after work by dancing the <strong>binatbatan</strong>. This depicts the beating of cotton pods to separate the seeds from the fibers with the use of two sticks called <em>batbat</em>. The dancers jump and hop outside and between parallel sticks on the floor in time to the song and music. The speed of the beating and rhythmic sounds produced by the sticks varies, depending on the ability of the dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>tanobong</strong>, named after a kind of long, coarse grass in Pangasinan, depicts the different steps in making brooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">War dances</a> survive among southern communities. The <strong>saot</strong> of the Talaandig is performed by men wearing the&nbsp;<em>tangkulo&nbsp;</em>(headdress), an index of a warrior&rsquo;s courage. The Tagoloanon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a>, and Higaonon also call their war dance saot, while the Tigwahanon and Matigsalug refer to their dance as <strong>kalasag</strong>. Headhunting is practiced among the northern Luzon groups. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> tribes, after women have welcomed headhunters with&nbsp;<em>lawi&nbsp;</em>(crowns of rooster tail feathers), the&nbsp;<em>minger&nbsp;</em>(successful hunters) perform the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/84\"><strong>pattong</strong></a> to the music of the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gangsa</a>&nbsp;</em>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>).<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2474\">Larry A.

In social gatherings, young men and women are invited to participate. The men pound the rice to musical accompaniment, usually a guitar. Finally, the women do the winnowing while singing and dancing. In Bulacan, the dance <strong>katlo</strong> (by threes) is performed during harvest season on moonlit nights. The men customarily offer to pound rice wherever there are young ladies to court. The Blaan have the <strong>maral</strong>, a suite of dances depicting the stages in rice planting, namely: the <strong>mabah</strong> which depicts the farmer&#x2019;s search for the kaingin area; the <strong>almigo</strong> which depicts the clearing of the forest; the <strong>amla</strong> or the planting stage; and the <strong>kamto</strong> which shows women harvesting the rice. The <a href=\"/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> portray the sowing of seeds in <strong>mag-asik</strong>, dancing around a large handkerchief."

		"text": "<p><strong>Modern dance</strong> is a theatrical dance form of contemporary approach, technique, or style, emerging from and reflective of the 20th century. In Europe, it is now called <strong>contemporary dance</strong>. It is not to be compared, however, with contemporary <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/96\">social dancing</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern dance may innovatively ignore the conventions of theatrical dance, as it may be performed in informal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">spaces</a> and outdoors. Technique may come from an individual conception and formulation. More recently, it may arise from an eclectic or combined training system. The style may be original and individual, or culled from established techniques and approaches in modern dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis are considered the founders of American modern dance. Duncan (1877-1927) was inspired by Greek philosophy and art, which she thought to be closest to nature&rsquo;s representation. She allied her manner of dancing to nature, rejecting constricting clothes and shoes. Duncan danced about ideal humanity as well as the liberation, of the woman and child especially, from all social and sexual constraints. She also freed dance from the use of conventional and limited music, and embodied the poetic ideals of Walt Whitman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>St. Denis (1879-1968) looked to Egypt, India, and East Asia for her subjects. Her simple ethnographic interest was more specific than that of Ted Shawn (1891-1972), her husband. Shawn&rsquo;s more eclectic approach included international forms and a few American themes. Both had a keen interest in religious dance. St. Denis was also known for music visualization, a compositional approach allied to music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the individual and combined efforts of St. Denis and Shawn came dancers of more specific techniques and thematic emphases: Martha Graham (1874-1991), Doris Humphrey (1895-1958), Charles Weidman (1901-75), and many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europe, dancer and choreographer Mary Wigman (1886-1973) led in Central European modern dance, dealing with monumental themes that characterized German expressionism. A student of Emile Jacques Dalcroze (1865-1950) and Rudolf von Laban (1879-1958), Wigman devoted much time to teaching in Germany and extended her knowledge to the United States through her student, Hanya Holm, from 1931.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In America, modern dance formed its schooled techniques with Graham&rsquo;s motivation from the breath process, coming out in the &ldquo;contraction&rdquo; and &ldquo;release,&rdquo; and with Humprey&rsquo;s two dynamic arcs of fall and recovery. Holm and Jose Limon (1908-72) also developed their own techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multimedia works of illusionist composer Alwin Nikolais, and the movement-focused chance method (including the simple simultaneity of dance and music) and the adaptable events of Merce Cunningham remain exceptional to this day. Other approaches and concepts were achieved by Ann Halprin, Yvonne Rainer, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp, Meredith Monk, and Mark Morris, some of whom are called postmodernists. They confronted both mythic and popular expressions. Today there are worldwide modern dance outgrowths. A most considerable development is a relatively new German expressionism, especially in the works of Pina Bausch of Wuppertal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So-called aesthetic dancing and skirt dance introduced some initial modern dance elements to the Philippines. Ada Delroy came in 1900, creating a sensation with her lighting and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costuming</a> that suggested the illusion of Louie Fuller (1862-1928), the successful American contemporary of Isadora Duncan in Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two Viennese dancers introduced both balletic and Central European modern dance styles in the 1930s: Kaethe Hauser and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2453\">Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</a>. Hauser became the teacher of modern dance soloist and Spanish dancer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2576\">Manolo Rosado</a>. Dubsky-Zipper founded the Manila Ballet Moderne, which apprenticed Filipinos, and choreographed for the Camargo Society, which helped begin professional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among those leading in Dubsky-Zipper&rsquo;s productions were Queenie Schrameck, Matilde Fernandes, Frances Lava, Patria Panahon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2569\">Ricardo Reyes</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2588\">Lucio Sandoval</a>. Her students who furthered modern dance were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2535\">Rosalia Merino-Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2480\">Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</a>, Maggie Shea, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2572\">Adina Rigor-Ferrer</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2620\">Remedios Villanueva-Pi&ntilde;on</a>. According to Pi&ntilde;on, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2424\">Roberta Cassell</a> also taught modern dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merino-Santos, a student of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2384\">Luva Adameit</a>, pursued graduate studies in modern dance in the United States. She later founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2466\">Far Eastern University Modern Experimental Dance Group</a>, which disseminated modern dance through her lecture-demonstration titled <em><strong>What is Dance?</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After his European and Mexican career on stage and brief study with Shawn and St. Denis in Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow, Massachusetts, Manolo Rosado performed and taught in Manila. For a short while, he directed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2612\">University of the East Dance Company</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teacher Carmen Adevoso attempted to bring modern dance into the public schools, but she soon migrated to the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\">Alice Reyes</a> placed modern dance at the forefront by establishing the Alice Reyes and Modern Dance Company at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> in 1970. The troupe evolved into the CCP Dance Company and the present-day <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\">Ballet Philippines (BP)</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2455\">Eddie Elejar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2462\">Tony Fabella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2621\">Basilio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2510\">Luis Layag</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2422\">Gener Caringal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\">Edna Vida</a> rose from the group&rsquo;s ranks to become modern dance choreographers. The visits of Norman Walker and instruction by Betsy Escandor and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\">Agnes Locsin</a> imparted a solid Graham technique to Filipino dancers. Locsin became artistic director of BP II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, BP presents both classical ballets and modern dances. Visiting choreographers like Walker, Pauline Koner, Garth Welch, Takako Asakawa, David Hatch Walker, Grey Veredon, Rosemary Helliwell, and Lynn Gifford have contributed to its repertoire. New choreographers are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2473\">Nonoy Froilan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2519\">Jojo Lucila</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2581\">Hazel Sabas</a>, Paul Ocampo, Regina Debuque, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2454\">Conrad Dy-Liacco</a>. Also from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2545\">Douglas Nierras</a> combines modern dance with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a> in his own group, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2559\">Powerdance</a>. The same is done by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2536\">Metropolitan Dance Theater Company</a>, Hotlegs, Whiplash, and other contemporary jazz groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the universities, Generoso-I&ntilde;igo, Basilio, Caringal, and Lucila have taught and choreographed for campus companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1990s, younger choreographers have produced notable works. Among them are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\">Myra Beltran</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2494\">Kristin Jackson</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\">Alden Lugnasin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2575\">Dwight Rodrigazo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2521\">Max Luna III</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2437\">Augustus Damian III</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2541\">Paul Alexander Morales</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2433\">Jay Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2507\">Elena Laniog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2395\">Herbert Alvarez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2509\">Angela Baguilat</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2619\">Ava Villanueva</a>, Japhet Mari Cabling, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2560\">Rhosam Prudenciado Jr</a>, Zyda Marie Baaya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2471\">Gerardo Francisco</a>, Mia Cabalfin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2396\">Jed Amihan</a>, Alfred Mercado, Frederick Fernandez, Ea Torrado, Al Bernard Garcia, Sarah Marie Samaniego, and Razielle Ann Mitchao.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Duncan danced about ideal humanity as well as the liberation, of the woman and child especially, from all social and sexual constraints.

Originally, the <strong>pallo-ok</strong> was the Itneg&rsquo;s victory dance. Being headhunters in earlier times, they danced the pallo-ok to celebrate the successful beheading of their enemy from another tribe. But now that headhunting is no longer practiced, they have tried to keep their dance alive by showcasing it during important revelries such as weddings, inaugurations, and cultural festivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An equal number of men and women&mdash;eight pairs at least and as many as the space can hold&mdash;dance the pallo-ok amidst the festive music produced by the <em>gansaneros</em> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a> players, who, from the sidelines, strike their hand-held instruments using the <em>palok</em> or piece of wood or stick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the western line dance, the pallo-ok is made up of steps that anyone wishing to join could easily follow. Male dancers either simply clap to the beat of the gongs or rest their hands on their waists. The female dancers also keep their arms akimbo, or they have them in a <strong>depa</strong>, where their arms are stretched sideways and their fingers are relaxed, pointing upward.

		"text": "<p>Descended from the Spanish fandango, the <strong>pandanggo</strong> is a dance in 3/4 or 6/8 time. It supposedly means &ldquo;go and dance,&rdquo; and is considered the base of all <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/98\">Spanish dances</a>. It is one of the most traditional of the Zapotec dances which reached Europe in the 17th century as the <strong>Reinos de las Indias</strong> of the American Indians. It has turned up in many variations as the <strong>malague&ntilde;a</strong>, <strong>rondina</strong>, <strong>grandina</strong>, and <strong>muricana</strong>. It could also have come from the Arab and Egyptian <em>ghawazees</em> (dancing girls) and could have been used later both for religious devotion and sexual flirtation. The Spanish fandango is danced to castanets, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitars</a>, tambourines, and alternately, to verses of love or <em>coplas</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brought to the islands during the Spanish colonial period, the <strong>fandango</strong> was indigenized into the local <strong>pandanggo</strong>, which is variously called <strong>pandangyado</strong>, <strong>pandanguedo</strong>, <strong>pangdangiodo</strong>, <strong>pandanguiado</strong>, <strong>pandangguhan</strong>, and <strong>pandang-pandang</strong>. It has been danced with various <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">properties</a>: <em>sa ilaw</em> (with light) in Mindoro, <em>sa sambalilo</em> (with hat) in Bulacan, <em>sa plato</em> (on a plate) in Laguna, <em>sa tapis</em> (with overskirt) in Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan, and <em>sa bulig</em> (with mudfish) in Bulacan again, involving skill as much as grace.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several regional or local variations: <strong>pandanguido burawe&ntilde;o</strong> in Samar, <strong>pandangiodo sorsogue&ntilde;o</strong> in Bicol, <strong>dumaguete&ntilde;o</strong> in Negros Oriental, <strong>laoaggue&ntilde;a</strong> and <strong>vintarina</strong> in Ilocos, <strong>ivatan</strong> in Batanes, <strong>pandanggo</strong> in Camiling and Moncada, Tarlac, <strong>sarrate&ntilde;o</strong> in Ilocos Norte, <strong>San Narciso</strong> in Quezon, Leyte, and Davao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is even a Talaingod pandangguhan which tells of a legendary charismatic leader named Emboyag. After bathing in a river, he danced the pandangguhan. After that, he ceremoniously left, saying that he had given the people the dance as a heritage. The <strong>sayaw sa obando</strong> has an accompanying song that says the dance is a pandanggo. It is danced for fertility, to find a wife or husband, or to seek a good harvest. It honors three saints&mdash;Santa Clara, Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Salambao, and San Pascual Bailon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandanggo, however, is predominantly a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship dance</a> as exemplified by the <strong>pandang-pandang</strong>, an Antique <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">wedding dance</a> where gifts, including money, are showered on the bridal couple. It exhibits the dexterity of the man, who claps beneath his raised knee or strikes his sides with flourish. The <strong>pandanggo ivatan</strong> from Batanes is held in the groom&rsquo;s home. Gifts or <em>gala</em> are also given, from the groom to his bride and from the guests to the couple. The guests are offered drinks in return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North to south, the pandanggo is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costumed</a>: from the <em>maria clara</em> (native gown) in the <em>pandangyado</em> that is only danced <em>amenudo</em> or by a couple in Samar, to the <em>balintawak</em> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, and the <em>patadyong</em> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bicolano</a> and Visayan. Many versions have sway balances, waltz steps, and turns, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><em>kumintang</em></a> in common. Many of the steps involve pursuing (in all directions), changing of places (some in quadrille style), and circling each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a display of coyness or invitation, applauding each other, and luring&mdash;with a hat, in the Tarlac and Leyte pandanggo, and <strong>pandanggo sa sambalilo</strong>; a kerchief, in the Samar pandangyado; a fan, in the Leyte pandanguiado burawe&ntilde;o; or a glass of wine, in the Quezon <strong>abaruray</strong>. With its attractive lights called <em>tinghoy</em>, the pandanggo sa ilaw from Mindoro, most possibly symbolical or occupational in origin, is the most theatrical and popular of all the pandanggo today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pandanggo has been featured by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">companies</a> like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a>, whose pandanggo sa ilaw has always been a showstopper.

It is also known as <strong>gandingan</strong> among the Yakan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">Pangalay comes from the Tausug verb <strong>mangalay</strong>, meaning &ldquo;to dance.&rdquo; It is identical to the igal of the Sama and the Sama Dilaut, igal being the generic term for &ldquo;dance&rdquo; in the Sulu Archipelago. Among the Yakan who speak Yakan Bahasa, a language variant of Sinama and Tausug, this dance is known as pansak which also means &ldquo;dance.&rdquo; Another term for pamansak in Yakan Bahasa is &ldquo;gandingan,&rdquo; coming from the word <em>ganding</em>, which is a style in playing traditional instruments. The steps in gandingan is formal and regal compared to pamansak, characterized by slow and flowing movements performed during the ceremonial gatherings of the Yakan elite and members of the royalty. In Tawi-Tawi, the term pamansak is synonymous with pangalay or igal performed on top of two bamboo poles, popularly known as <strong>igal</strong>/<strong>pangalay ha taas patung</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">In Basilan, the gandingan or pamansak performance is accompanied by the <em>tagungguh</em>, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a> ensemble consisting of three gongs of different sizes, a set of <em>kwintangan tumbaga</em>, five knobbed gongs in graduated sizes, and the <em>gandang</em>, a split bamboo tube. Yakan dancers wear the <em>sawwal</em> or loose trousers from an intricately woven fabric called <em>sinelu&rsquo;an</em>. The sawwal has tight-fitting legs from knee-down, with a knee-joinery line called <em>bakiyaq</em> and leg tassels made of silk threads called <em>jambu</em>. The <em>badju</em> is the tight-fitting top with long and tight sleeves made of woven material and decorated with gold buttons called <em>batawi</em>. The male badju is usually open at the front with a pair of jambu sewn at the collar while the female version is closed by string or by a pentagonal chest covering called <em>lapi</em>. The women wear the <em>olos</em> or tubular skirt fastened around the waist. The men wear the <em>kandit</em> or belt made of <em>gilim</em> or red cotton cloth tediously coiled around the waist. To symbolize bravery and strength, men don a <em>pis</em> or head-cloth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">In Tawi-Tawi and Sulu provinces, the kulintangan ensemble provides accompaniment, which is very fast and in contrast to the meditative and slow pangalay movements. Female dancers customarily wear a <em>sablay</em> (loose blouse) or a <em>biyatawi</em> (tight-fitting blouse). This is paired with either a <em>patadjung</em> (wrap-around skirt) or a <em>sawwal kantiu</em> (loose trousers) in which a <em>siyag</em> (sash of folded patadjung) placed on the shoulder is mandatory to cover the crotch for modesty&rsquo;s sake. Male dancers wear a <em>badju</em> (loose shirt) or <em>badju lapi</em> (shirt with tight-fitting sleeves) ornamented with brass or silver buttons similar to those on the <em>biyatawi</em>. The lower garment is either a sawwal kantiu or a <em>sawwal kuput</em> (tight-fitting trousers) also ornamented with buttons at the cuffs. A <em>sabitan</em> (belt) or a <em>kandit</em> (sash) fastens the trousers to the waist. A matching scarf placed on the shoulder or wrapped around the head completes the male attire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">Pangalay, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/68\"><strong>langka</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">martial dance</a> style, bears close affinity to the Thai, Cambodian, and Balinese forms. It can be danced in open spaces like beaches and community plazas, or small confined spaces like the boats and houses. It is a meditative dance executed with downcast eyes and a dignified facial expression. Performed by both men and women of all ages on celebratory occasions, pangalay consists of the deceivingly simple but intricate postures and gestures basic to the traditional dances of the Sulu Archipelago. Knees are perennially bent with a slow and subtle bouncing motion that achieves the appearance of lightness and undulating motion of gentle waves. Knees of male dancers are apart while female dancers are close together while dancing. Hip and torso movements are very minimal. The torso is relaxed and slightly bent forward to a point of equilibrium, similar to stances in Asian martial arts and Asian traditional dances. The dancer&rsquo;s arms and hands express images and feelings combined with various footwork. Arms and hands placed above the head may express joy, and over the face and chest may express resistance or protection. Gestures of arms and hands may convey visual metaphors of the wind, sea waves, flowers, butterflies, and birds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">It takes constant exposure to the numerous pangalay variants to distinguish the levels and lines of the direction of movement, the subtle dance flourishes, the peculiar entry and exit stances, the creeping or shuffling footwork, the seductive flip and flutter of hands and fingers. For instance, before doing the traditional hand turn that consists of outward-inward or inward-inward motion from the wrist, the dancer may execute several gesture variations: flicking, flipping, or cupping the fingers; abruptly flicking the hand itself from the wrist; or pressing the tips of thumb and index fingers together, leaving the three other fingers in the usual upturned position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">Courtship and wedding dances</a> are included in the pangalay dance style. The <strong>pangilok</strong> and the <strong>eringan</strong> are similar Sama courtship dances, although the latter uses <em>janggay</em> or metal claws, which are also called <em>sulakengkeng</em> and <em>saling-kuku</em>. The <strong>igal ha agung</strong> is a subtly teasing dance where a man rolls, crawls, kneels, and follows a woman about, all the while beating an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\"><em>agung</em></a>. In the <strong>pangasig</strong>, a Sama male plays the <em>tungtung</em> (the smallest gong in the kulintang set), teasing and dancing around a female partner who pretends not to notice his advances. The <strong>pangalay pangantin</strong> is performed by a bride shielded with a bridal curtain called a <em>tabil</em>. The bridegroom follows behind the curtain to signify his readiness to defend the bride. The highlight of the dance is the flicking of the janggay used by the bride. The over-vigilant groom quickly retrieves every janggay that falls to the floor, and then ceremoniously returns the whole set to the bride at the end of the dance. When performed in the open, this dance has the backdrop of colorful flags called <em>sambulayang</em>, which is also another name for pangalay pangantin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">The pangalay/pamansak is also part of the Yakan wedding ceremony called <strong>pegkawin</strong> or <strong>pagkawin</strong>. At the start of the elaborate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> when the groom enters the bride&rsquo;s house, a female dancer performs the pamansak/pangalay along with skillful tumahik martial dancers to the accompaniment of <em>tagungguh</em> musicians playing the <em>megtambul</em> or tumahik rhythm. After the wedding ceremony, the couple will sometimes be requested to dance the <strong>pansak pagkawin</strong> or wedding dance. The bride and groom execute pamansak movements without any body contact, even as the groom pursues the evasive bride. The groom then uncoils a part of his kandit using some tumahik movements like floor-scratching footwork. He tries to catch his bride with his long belt. The bride tries to slip away from the coil but the groom persists. In the groom&rsquo;s third attempt, the bride dances in place to signify her acceptance to be the wife. The groom then encircles the bride, twirling half the belt&rsquo;s length around her waist as a symbol of the groom&rsquo;s obligation to protect his wife and children at all times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">Tawi-Tawi&rsquo;s pamansak or <strong>pangalay</strong>/<strong>igal ha taas patung</strong> is a difficult dance that requires balance, alignment, concentration, strength, and stamina. This variant originated from the Sama of Simunul, Tawi-Tawi. The female dances atop twin bamboo poles borne on the shoulders of two men. One or two male partners join the dance simultaneously or alternately, performing a <strong>langka</strong> or martial dance while the female dancer is lowered to the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">There are also pangalay/igal dances that are performed for entertainment. The <strong>bula-bula</strong> is a Sama Dilaut version of dancing with <em>bula</em> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/806\">clappers</a> made of bamboo, hardwood, or shells. Both male and female dancers click the bula to the beat of percussive ensemble music. The <strong>tariray</strong> is a Sama Dilaut version of dancing with clappers to the staccato accompaniment of brass percussion. The <strong>igal ha panyu</strong> is performed by young Samal and Tausug men and women seated in a circle, singing a lively folk tune. It is similar to other drop-the-handkerchief games where a dance-chase ensues with a handkerchief or a stick used to touch or &ldquo;catch&rdquo; a girl or boy. The <strong>pangsangbay</strong> or <strong>dalling-dalling</strong> is a Tausug <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/97\">song dance</a> performed by male and female dancers wearing fantastic makeup, pasteboard crowns, and capes. The lyrics of the song accompaniment are interpreted comically with the aid of a fan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">Ritual dances</a> also employ simple igal/pangalay movements, postures, and gestures. The <strong>magjinn</strong> or <strong>pagjinn</strong> from the Sama Dilaut of Sitangkai, Tawi-Tawi is performed on the fourteenth moon to appease or to drive away an unfriendly <em>jinn</em> or spirit. The performers take turns dancing until some of them go into a trance. The ritual ends when the ritual leader whips the possessed performers with his yellow headscarf or <em>pis</em> to revive them. Early the next morning, another prayer is recited by the ritual leader before a miniature <em>lepa</em> festooned with miniature flags and laden with food offerings is set to sail. It is believed that the well-provided spirit will be appeased during its long voyage. The <strong>magjuwata</strong> from Tabawan, South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi, is a Sama ritual dance to drive away spirits that cause illness. All performers are female except the ritual leader. Toward the end of the ritual, the leader whips the patient in the belief that it is the <em>jinn</em> or spirit which receives the blows. Another version from Banaran, Tawi-Tawi, is performed on a Friday evening when the moon is full, either to foretell the future, drive away <em>busung</em> or bad luck, or invoke the help of spirits in recovering stolen property. <strong>Magpugot</strong> from the Sama of Musu, Siasi, Sulu, is a dance ritual to drive away evil spirits. The ritual performers gather around the patient lying before a ritual accessory made of woven nipa ribs wrapped in yellow cloth with multicolored flags attached to the four corners. The ritual leader&rsquo;s pis and ritual costumes are hung on a stick tied across the woven ritual accessory. After chanting prayers and performing other preliminaries, the ritual leader dances about, impersonating several spirits, complete with rapid costume changes imitated by all ritual performers. After the patient&rsquo;s affliction is identified, more frenzied dancing ensues. The ritual leader, now seemingly in a trance, hits the patient with his pis to drive away evil spirits. Dancing slows down when the patient kisses the hand of the ritual leader. The <strong>magsalba</strong> is a Sama dance ritual from Bulikulul, Siasi, Sulu. One of the six all-male performers officiates as a medium, remaining seated before an incense burner while the others dance around him. Later, he rises and dances in a circle several times each way, followed by the other performers. The ritual ends when the incense smoke peters out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">The pangalay/igal tradition also has mimetic forms imitating animals or humans in various occupations. The <strong>igal kussa</strong> depicts a wild boar tossing about a coconut that will not crack open. The dance, which also invariably elicits much laughter, is danced by a man. The <strong>linggisan</strong> is a Samal-Tausug interpretation of a bird in flight. <strong>Kaba-kaba</strong> is a Samal imitation of mating butterflies, and <strong>pagkamun</strong> of a sea mantis, performed by a man or a woman. The <strong>pangasik</strong> portrays a mating rooster; this Samal and Tausug dance is usually performed solo by a man and complements a female pangalay performance. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/68\"><strong>langka baluang</strong></a> is a Samal-Tausug dance that mimics an angry monkey. Postures and gestures in the pangalay and langka&mdash;a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">combat dance</a> sometimes integrated into the pangalay&mdash;are humorous and always performed by a man. The <strong>igal buwani</strong> is a Samal-Tausug dance performed by torch-bearing male dancers who comically depict the hazards of honey gathering. The <strong>tawti</strong>, originally from Tawi-Tawi, amusingly portrays the difficulties of catching <em>tawti</em> or catfish. The dancer wears a <em>bahag</em> fashioned by securely tucking to the waist the rolled trouser legs of the sawwal kantiu or patajung. In one version, the fisher poisons the water and scoops up the dazed tawti with his bare hands; his big toe is pricked when accidentally stepping on a tawti. He thrashes about in pain, paddles for shore, and skips and jumps home. In another version, fishermen try to put the wriggling fish in a basket, get pricked in the big toe, and make their escape in a boat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"border:none; margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 8pt\">The Yakan of Lamitan have a variant called <strong>pansak si karendehan</strong> or dance of the maidens. This variant is an all-female dance exhibiting languid arm and hand gestures of the pangalay. However, one distinct hand gesture that gives the gandingan/pamansak a Yakan identity is the <strong>eddek</strong> or hand movements that mimic rice planting. Eddek movements and gestures are indicative of the Yakan&rsquo;s culture as planters tilling Basilan&rsquo;s interior farmlands, in contrast to the seafaring cultures of the Samal, Tausug, Sama Dilaut, and Jama Mapun.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a>, updated by Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

Among the Yakan who speak Yakan Bahasa, a language variant of Sinama and Tausug, this dance is known as pansak which also means &#x201C;dance.&#x201D; Another term for pamansak in Yakan Bahasa is &#x201C;gandingan,&#x201D; coming from the word <em>ganding</em>, which is a style in playing traditional instruments. The steps in gandingan is formal and regal compared to pamansak, characterized by slow and flowing movements performed during the ceremonial gatherings of the Yakan elite and members of the royalty. In Tawi-Tawi, the term pamansak is synonymous with pangalay or igal performed on top of two bamboo poles, popularly known as <strong>igal</strong>/<strong>pangalay ha taas patung</strong>."

Yakan dancers wear the <em>sawwal</em> or loose trousers from an intricately woven fabric called <em>sinelu&#x2019;an</em>. The sawwal has tight-fitting legs from knee-down, with a knee-joinery line called <em>bakiyaq</em> and leg tassels made of silk threads called <em>jambu</em>. The <em>badju</em> is the tight-fitting top with long and tight sleeves made of woven material and decorated with gold buttons called <em>batawi</em>. The male badju is usually open at the front with a pair of jambu sewn at the collar while the female version is closed by string or by a pentagonal chest covering called <em>lapi</em>. The women wear the <em>olos</em> or tubular skirt fastened around the waist. The men wear the <em>kandit</em> or belt made of <em>gilim</em> or red cotton cloth tediously coiled around the waist. To symbolize bravery and strength, men don a <em>pis</em> or head-cloth."

Ordinarily, the pantomina is danced in&nbsp;<em>patadyong&nbsp;</em>and barong tagalog. The dancers may improvise, or follow fundamental movements to 2/4 and 3/4 signatures.

The male dancer leads the female dancer in moving forward and backward, turning together or singly in a circle using a variety of hand movements and holds. It became a very popular and stylish ballroom dance in the Philippines, and is at present being revived in dancing clubs and social gatherings.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>pastores</strong>, from Spanish&nbsp;<em>pastores&nbsp;</em>meaning &ldquo;shepherds,&rdquo; is a dramatization of the shepherds&rsquo;s adoration of the Infant Jesus in Bethlehem, usually presented in the days just before Christmas or on Christmas Eve; it can also refer to a band of singers dressed as shepherds who perform Christmas songs and dances from house to house during the Christmas season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Far north in Cagayan, there is the <strong>infantes</strong>, which is the locality&rsquo;s equivalent for the pastores<em>.</em>The girls dress like baby dolls and click bamboo castanets, while the boys beat on bamboo tubes called <strong>tubtubong</strong> <em>.</em>The Three Kings are represented as simulated <strong>higante</strong> (giants), while accompanying angels are teased by a comic who represents the devil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bicol, the pastores are 12 adults or children, mostly female, led by a <strong>capitana</strong> (female captain). The number probably alludes to the apostles with the capitanarepresenting Christ. The &ldquo;shepherdesses&rdquo; wear full skirts, round-necked blouses with puffed sleeves, and wide-brimmed hats, while the &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo; sport long-sleeved shirts, breast and waistbands, and decorated hats. Groups dress in a uniform color&mdash;red, blue, or green. At every house, they sing, to the accompaniment of a small orchestra (<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar,</a> <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violin</a>, bass, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a>), a series of Spanish <strong>villancicos</strong> or carols (including &ldquo;Pastores a Belen,&rdquo; which is attributed to <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>), as well as <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> carols, while executing dance movements and patterns, using handkerchiefs and rattan <strong>arko</strong> or arches gaily trimmed with colorful paper as props. They are gifted with money or food by the owners of houses at which they sing. To encourage the barrio people to continue with the tradition, pastores contests are held on stage in Legazpi, Albay, during the Christmas season.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Most colorful in Bicol is <strong>pastores Talisay</strong> in Camarines Norte. Looking colorfully Mexican, it has women swirling their voluminous&nbsp;<em>poblana&nbsp;</em>skirts like cascading rainbows, while the men bear papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; horses to signify that they are riding up and down hills. With kaleidoscopic movements, the women also carry arches of flowers. Another in Pilar, Sorsogon, is <strong>pastores Santo Ni&ntilde;o</strong>, where boys dress in Middle Eastern shepherds&rsquo; garb (long white soutanes and head scarves with headband), the girls in white or pastel dresses, usually wearing hats with ribbons or flowers. They dance to &ldquo;Vamos a Belen&rdquo;played by a&nbsp;<em>rondalla&nbsp;</em>and a drum. Still another is <strong>pastores Tubog</strong> in Oas, Albay, where again shepherds dress in the Middle Eastern way, with children carrying lambs (made of bamboo and rice paper) as&nbsp;<em>pi&ntilde;atas&nbsp;</em>and floral arches. Six pairs of girls and boys are led by a capitana. Characteristically, they wear abaca slippers with simulated cloth leggings and sing in Spanish, Latin, and Bikol. This is done on the feast of the Three Kings. <strong>Pastores Bungiawon</strong> is also attributed to Oas in Albay. Here, the girls put ruffles of recycled plastic bags around their skirts and arches. In Mercedes, Eastern Samar, skirts are made of crepe paper, and blouses from commercial plastic sacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her masteral thesis in the University of the Philippines, Jiye A. Margate describes the <strong>pastoras</strong> from Camarines Sur. In the <strong>pastora Baao</strong> and <strong>pastora Bombon</strong>, girls wear the usual pretty dresses and hats and sing to different musical accompaniments: in Baao, originally to the violin, double bass, and guitar, but now only to the saxophone; and in Bombon, originally to saxophone, violin, guitar, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>, but now more often just to a guitar. Here girls train under their elders and danceas <strong>panata</strong> (vow) to the Virgin Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cebu and Leyte, the pastores, played by a group of children wearing hats with bands, sing and dance at different houses, confront and drive away the devil, who dissuades them from visiting the Messiah, and then proceed on their journey to adore the child. Sometimes a couple playing Mary and Joseph presents them with the image of the Christ Child at some point in the journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out in Cebu is <strong>pastores Kalawit</strong> in one of the Camotes Islands, where middle-aged women dance as their fellow fisherfolk watch them. In the <strong>nacio pastores</strong> of New Washington, Aklan, the ritualists dance with the image of the <strong>Ni&ntilde;o dormido</strong> (asleep) and sing old villancicos<em>.&nbsp;</em>In Ibajay, Aklan, the <strong>bailo</strong> (from&nbsp;<em>baile</em>) <strong>de pastores</strong> features boys and girls dressed in white with red waistbands and hats with flowers and carrying tambourines while dancing. In Leyte, <strong>pastores Tolosa</strong> has singing in Waray, with a comic encounter between the devil and the shepherds. Also in Ormoc, Leyte, a little more complex scenario shows a half-man and half-monkey devil trying to mislead the shepherds until the latter are rescued by an angel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of these pastores with place-names are from the field research of National Artist <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2547\">Ramon Arevalo Obusan</a>. These names serve as index to the repertoire of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2564\">Ramon A. Obusan Folkloric Group</a>. For several years, Obusan presented the program <strong><em>Vamos at Belen</em></strong> every December at the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor G.

Groups dress in a uniform color&#x2014;red, blue, or green.

Instead, the pattong focuses on the syncopated rhythm produced by the different <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\"><em>gangsa</em></a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a> played by the musicians and the synchronized movements of the female dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dance usually has eight to ten gong players, with each one keeping to his own distinct beat to create the syncopated rhythm that Cordillera music is known for. The Bontoc use three types of gongs: the <em>kalos</em>, which is the smallest kind, the <em>sar-ong-ko-ongan</em>, which produces a bass sound, and the <em>marwas</em>, which produces a tenor tune. Female dancers wear <em>appong</em> (also <em>appongey</em>) or beads around their heads, a <em>lufid</em> (also <em>tapis</em>) or three-piece woven cloth, and a <em>wakes</em> or colorful woven belt worn to hold the lufid. The men, on the other hand, wear a crown made of rattan and decorated with pig&#39;s jaws and feathers, a <em>tangka</em> (also <em>tanka</em>) or arm bracelet with bound hair fastened to it, and a <em>wanes</em> or loincloth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance begins with the entrance of the gong players and the female dancers from opposite ends. They form two parallel lines in the beginning, then a circle, and much later on, an inner and an outer circle. The men move from one formation to the next doing a <strong>sikwat</strong> or a hop on the left then the right foot, with the heels alternately raised toward the back. The sikwat is interchanged with slide steps where the trunk is slightly bent forward. They do the running steps when they weave in and out the circle of women. Throughout all the steps, the men never stop beating their gongs. The women, on the other hand, either do a step-close step when dancing in place, with the raised heel of the second foot. They also do the sikwat to move about. Their hips always sway right and left during the whole dance. Their arm movements are simple, either resting on their hips or stretched sideways, with hands in a fist and thumbs up. In the past, the Bontoc performed the pattong to ask help from Lumawig, their supreme deity, for a successful headhunt or to thank him after their request had been granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, this dance is performed even during ordinary occasions to simply entertain tourists. In Central Bontoc, the pattong is danced from February to April to implore Lumawig for rain for their crops. For this purpose, the pattong is preceded by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> of pouring wine on the rice terraces.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Sarah Lumba</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/2\">Indigenous Traditions and Transformations in Philippine Dance</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a> Dancing</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Orosa-Goquingco, Leonor. 1980<em>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/20\"><strong>The Dances of the Emerald Isles</strong></a>. </em>Quezon City: Ben-Lor Publishers, Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taguba, Remedios, and Carmen T.

		"text": "<p>The northern and southern Kalinga have more <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dances</a> than the groups from Benguet, Ifugao, and the Mountain Province. One of these dances is the <strong>pattung</strong>, which is performed in almost all ceremonies the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> considers important&mdash;a wedding, a&nbsp;<em>sakyat</em> or house blessing, the welcoming of the first&nbsp;<em>aumpo&nbsp;</em>/&nbsp;<em>copcopi&nbsp;</em>or grandchild, a&nbsp;<em>bodong&nbsp;</em>or peace pact with another tribe, even an inauguration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pattung begins with the single-file entrance of&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gangsa</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a> players, all male, each wearing a&nbsp;<em>baal&nbsp;</em>or loincloth. As they beat their hand-held bronze gangsa with a stick in syncopated rhythm, they execute the brush-and-scratch step, which involves a quick brush forward of the ball of the left foot for one count, then a return to its original position for another count. Their trunks are slightly bent forward. The dance requires only six gong players. Unlike many of the Cordillera dances where the musicians merely stay on the sidelines, these six are also dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pattung can have an unlimited number of female dancers, and they enter with the same footwork as the men&rsquo;s. The feet of both male and female dancers never get any rest once the pattung begins. The brush-and-scratch step is quickly followed by the spring-and-swing step, which is a small hop on the right foot on the first count and a swing forward, backward or sideward of the left on the second count. The next step is the hop-step combination, where the second foot is dragged forward after a hop. At some point, pivots and lunges are also done. Then all the challenging footwork is repeated. The beat, though, never slows down. In fact, like all Cordillera dances, it becomes faster and faster as the dance nears its climax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nonstop footwork is combined with arm movements such as the <strong>sokot</strong> or hands on waist; the <strong>dopa</strong> or arms stretched sideways, palms facing out, fingers pointing up; and arms alternately raised. Like other Cordillera dances, at no point do the male and female dancers touch, even as they come in close proximity to each other as they go through various formations such as a single-line formation with males and females alternating; a circle; and two circles, one inner with female dancers and one outer, comprised only of male dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">Costumes</a> for the pattung are the same as those of other Kalinga dances. The men are in a&nbsp;<em>bool&nbsp;</em>or loincloth, with or without a&nbsp;<em>bidang</em>, a woven piece of cloth draped across the shoulders. The women wear a&nbsp;<em>tapis&nbsp;</em>or woven wrap-around skirt. All costumes, including the beaded headdresses, necklaces, and bracelets all dancers wear, are predominantly bright red, with touches of yellow, green, white, and black.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Sarah Lumba</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/2\">Indigenous Traditions and Transformations in Philippine Dance</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a> Dancing</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Taguba, Remedios, and Carmen T.

The next step is the hop-step combination, where the second foot is dragged forward after a hop. At some point, pivots and lunges are also done. Then all the challenging footwork is repeated. The beat, though, never slows down. In fact, like all Cordillera dances, it becomes faster and faster as the dance nears its climax."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The nonstop footwork is combined with arm movements such as the <strong>sokot</strong> or hands on waist; the <strong>dopa</strong> or arms stretched sideways, palms facing out, fingers pointing up; and arms alternately raised. Like other Cordillera dances, at no point do the male and female dancers touch, even as they come in close proximity to each other as they go through various formations such as a single-line formation with males and females alternating; a circle; and two circles, one inner with female dancers and one outer, comprised only of male dancers."

The women wear a&#xA0;<em>tapis&#xA0;</em>or woven wrap-around skirt.

It is quite similar to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/107\"><strong>tongatong</strong></a>, the courtship dance from eastern Mountain Province, where a couple, usually young, dances flirtatiously to the syncopated beat produced by the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gangsa</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a> beaters. Instead of using an&nbsp;<em>allap&nbsp;</em>or a huge piece of unsewn cloth as in the tongatong, the pinanyoan uses simple handkerchiefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like any courtship dance of the Cordillera region, the pinanyoan portrays a suitor pursuing a proud, seemingly disinterested maiden. The male dancer, in a&nbsp;<em>wanes&nbsp;</em>or loincloth and a&nbsp;<em>bedbed&nbsp;</em>or woven headdress, uses the <strong>sagedsed</strong> or tiny running steps to chase the female dancer, enticing her by whirling, waving, and shaking his handkerchief over her head. Sometimes, he continuously hops left, then right, while his left hand remains steady on his waist and his right hand does all the work, waving the handkerchief over his own head.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The female dancer, on the other hand, walks around, with knees bouncing slightly. Wearing a&nbsp;<em>gabey&nbsp;</em>(also&nbsp;<em>gaboy</em>) or three-piece cloth and a bedbed, she either has her hands resting on her waist or her arms stretched sideways with fingers pointing up. Her own handkerchief is on her shoulder so as to reveal nothing of her affection toward her suitor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a certain point, the two dancers face each other, seemingly measuring each other. Then the next move signifies the romantic tension between them: standing side-by-side but not touching, they pass each other using tortillier steps, both holding their handkerchiefs at waist level, a sign of mutual affection. To prolong the courtship, there is more chasing using the sagedsed, first clockwise with the man pursuing the woman, then counterclockwise, with the woman now acknowledging the man&rsquo;s efforts. The pinanyoan&rsquo;s finale comes when the man places his handkerchief on the woman&rsquo;s right arm. The gongs stop playing. The woman&rsquo;s left hand goes to his waist. Then he immediately places his hands on her waist, too, and they exit together as a couple. The pinanyoan is performed during weddings and anniversaries, the first birthday of the firstborn, even during&nbsp;<em>begnas</em>, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> held during the planting and harvesting season.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Sarah Lumba</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\"><strong>Courtship and Wedding Dances</strong></a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<section>\r\n<p>Taguba, Remedios, and Carmen T.

		"text": "<p>Polynesian and Tahitian dances originated from the Polynesian chain, which is composed of seven major island groups scattered throughout the South Pacific Ocean: Hawaii, Tahiti, New Zealand, Samoa, Rarotonga, Fiji, and the Marquesas. The <strong>hula</strong> is known as the unwritten literature of Hawaii. In ancient times, before there was a system of writing in Hawaii, traditions and history were handed down from generation to generation through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chants</a> and dances. The hula integrates <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, music, pantomime, and dance to form a dramatic art. It is a celebration of those mythical times when gods and goddesses moved on the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hula today may be divided into two types: the <strong>classic hula</strong>, and the modern and <strong>hapa-haole hula</strong>. The first type is done either to Hawaiian-language chants or songs with historical themes, telling of their kings and queens, the battles they fought, or the beauty of the land. The dances are done with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">implements</a> made of stone or <em>ili-ili</em>, split bamboo or <em>pu-i-lis</em>, feathered gourds or <em>uli-uli</em>, and desiccated fruit or <em>ipu</em>. The movements are strong, energetic, and involve the whole body, rather than just the hips. Men used to perform the hula until warfare took up most of their time; then women kept the tradition alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The modern hulas are more common, often done to romantic music with English lyrics, and are about love or the beauty of Hawaii. Although the hip movement is now slightly more emphasized, the overall movements are more controlled and graceful&mdash;a result of the missionaries&rsquo; zeal against what they considered immoral and indecent. Hula dancers wear traditional clothing such as the <em>sarong</em>, <em>holoku</em>, <em>holomu</em>, <em>kikepa</em>, and <em>mumu</em>. Grass skirts are Tahitian in origin; in Hawaii, they hang from the waist to the knees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two types of Tahitian hulas: the <strong>aparimas</strong> and the <strong>oteas</strong>. The oteas are the more familiar dances. They are ceremonial, performed to the accompaniment of various percussion instruments, with complicated rhythmic patterns. Tahitian dances are freer than Hawaiian, with the motion beginning at the hips and ending at the knees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dancers usually carry <em>iis</em>, flowers or leaves, while they do the otea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aparima hulas are done to music and words that tell of nature or Tahitian history. The dances may be done standing or with the dancers sitting in a circle, using their hands to interpret the story, much as the Hawaiians and Samoans do. The most famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume</a> is the <em>bora-bora</em>, a grass skirt that goes down to the ankles and is decorated at the hips. Dancers wear elaborate headdresses made of flowers and leaves, or shells. For aparima hulas, they use <em>pareus</em> or <em>lava-lava</em>, strips of flowered material tied around the hips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maori of New Zealand have two types of dances: action songs and <strong>haka</strong>. The action song is not a series of drill movements, but a rhythmic expression of moods and emotions, with different actions and words, and is used in the numerous tribal areas. The haka is more energetic and rigorous. Although the grimaces of the haka dancer, his painted face, and sticking out of the tongue may seem aggressive in some cultures, to the Maori these signify friendship and welcome. Dancers wear skirts called <em>piu-piu</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the 1950s, Filipinos had little knowledge of Polynesian dancing beyond the mistaken notion that Hawaiian was simply a titillating dance to entertain sailors, and that Tahitian dancing was the mere shaking and shivering of grass skirts. In the late 1950s, touring Filipino dance troupes brought back the authentic movements. Hula aficionados started hula <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">classes</a>. Among the pioneer teachers were Lucy Gonzales, Naty Bas, Chiqui Ocampo, Nenuca Ros, Carmen Garcia, and Carmen Gonzales. In 1972, the Polynesian Dance Company, trained and directed by Ocampo, performed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, introducing traditional and classic hulas of Hawaii, aparima, and Maori dances. In 1980, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">company</a>, now renamed Pacifica Cultural Dance Company, introduced dances from Samoa, Fiji, and Rarotonga. Other dance groups that have promoted Polynesian dance are the Maile Dance Company, the Aldeguer Sisters, Tiare Dance Troupe, and the Polynesian Cultural Dance Company Philippines.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by C.

Hula dancers wear traditional clothing such as the <em>sarong</em>, <em>holoku</em>, <em>holomu</em>, <em>kikepa</em>, and <em>mumu</em>. Grass skirts are Tahitian in origin; in Hawaii, they hang from the waist to the knees."

				"value": "There are two types of Tahitian hulas: the <strong>aparimas</strong> and the <strong>oteas</strong>. The oteas are the more familiar dances. They are ceremonial, performed to the accompaniment of various percussion instruments, with complicated rhythmic patterns. Tahitian dances are freer than Hawaiian, with the motion beginning at the hips and ending at the knees."

The dances may be done standing or with the dancers sitting in a circle, using their hands to interpret the story, much as the Hawaiians and Samoans do. The most famous <a href=\"/6/47/29\">costume</a> is the <em>bora-bora</em>, a grass skirt that goes down to the ankles and is decorated at the hips. Dancers wear elaborate headdresses made of flowers and leaves, or shells. For aparima hulas, they use <em>pareus</em> or <em>lava-lava</em>, strips of flowered material tied around the hips."

The action song is not a series of drill movements, but a rhythmic expression of moods and emotions, with different actions and words, and is used in the numerous tribal areas. The haka is more energetic and rigorous. Although the grimaces of the haka dancer, his painted face, and sticking out of the tongue may seem aggressive in some cultures, to the Maori these signify friendship and welcome. Dancers wear skirts called <em>piu-piu</em>."

In the late 1950s, touring Filipino dance troupes brought back the authentic movements. Hula aficionados started hula <a href=\"/6/47/30\">classes</a>. Among the pioneer teachers were Lucy Gonzales, Naty Bas, Chiqui Ocampo, Nenuca Ros, Carmen Garcia, and Carmen Gonzales. In 1972, the Polynesian Dance Company, trained and directed by Ocampo, performed at the <a href=\"/5/42/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, introducing traditional and classic hulas of Hawaii, aparima, and Maori dances. In 1980, the <a href=\"/6/47/27\">company</a>, now renamed Pacifica Cultural Dance Company, introduced dances from Samoa, Fiji, and Rarotonga. Other dance groups that have promoted Polynesian dance are the Maile Dance Company, the Aldeguer Sisters, Tiare Dance Troupe, and the Polynesian Cultural Dance Company Philippines.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span></strong>"

		"text": "<p>Rice is considered the most important staple food crop in the Philippines. Rice planting dances are classified under the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/2\">occupational dance</a> genre showing the different steps in the process of planting and harvesting the crop which may be grown in the lowlands or the highlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a>&rsquo;s <em><strong>Rice Festival Suite</strong></em> is a collection of lowland dances that depicts the different steps in rice cultivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first part is <strong>pagtatanim</strong> or planting, performed by a group of all men, of all women, or of mixed men and women. They wear ordinary rice planting clothes with or without head covers and hats. Dancers form two lines as they enter the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">performance area</a> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">props</a> such as baskets with rice seedlings and farm tools. These props may be real, fabricated, or merely suggested through mime. Dancers hold a clump of seedlings with the left hand and arm while they use their right hand to act out the sowing of seedlings into rice paddies. They bend and stoop while executing the planting movements according to the beat of the song <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/936\">&ldquo;Magtanim ay Di Biro&rdquo;</a> (&ldquo;Planting Rice Is Never Fun&rdquo;). Dancers repeat these movements in different directions. The pagtatanim ends with dancers leaving the performance area, with some arranging their tools and others putting away their props.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next part is the <strong>paggapas</strong> or harvest. The harvesters enter the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">stage</a> holding scythes, knives, or bladed tools for cutting rice stalks. This is a group dance composed of four to eight dancers who are casually dispersed facing different directions. With or without these props, they imitate the cutting of rice stalks with stooping postures and bent knees accompanied by close step footwork. Dancers move from place to place while repeating these movements and gestures. Then the dancers dispense of their cutting instruments and proceed to tie&nbsp;<em>palay</em> (rice) stalks into bundles which are then thrown over to one area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third part of the rice festival suite is the <strong>paggiik</strong> or threshing, which illustrates the separation of rice grains from the stalks. Male and female dancers garbed in working clothes enter with props such as a bamboo pole about eight feet long, a mat, and palay stalks. Two female dancers hold the pole at both ends at waist level. The mat is placed underneath. Male and female threshers hold on to the bamboo pole as they trample and tread over the rice stalks, sometimes sweeping the stalks with the left or the right foot. Then the threshers let go of the pole and female holders dispose of it. To the rhythm of the music, threshers perform several movements: they gather and shake the stalks to separate them from the grains, throw the stalks to a designated spot, and pile the grains neatly into a heap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an interesting variant of rice threshing from Laguna called <strong>paglulugas</strong> or <strong>tioka</strong> (flailing), performed only by male dancers because the actual occupation entails hard labor. The&nbsp;<em>tioka&nbsp;</em>is a threshing tool made from two bamboo sticks connected by a rope that is used to bind a sheaf of palay. Once the palay are securely tied to the tioka, the stalks are violently beaten on a mortar or a log lying on the ground. The violent action allows rice grains to fall. The dance is characterized by the rhythmic and synchronized striking of the palay stalks on the log or mortar. The dance combines several movements involving the use of the tioka. Male dancers initially hold the tioka over their shoulders with both hands, strike the mortar, and then pause. Dancers follow a sequence of strikes and pauses. The orchestrated striking is necessary so that threshers will not hit each other. In between these movements, dancers shake the stalks, collect rice seeds, or change sheafs of palay in the tioka. Paglulugas ends with a series of striking movements on the log or mortar, followed by the dancers&rsquo; return to proper places with the tioka over the right shoulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After threshing comes <strong>pahangin</strong> or airing, which is the separation of the grain from the chaff. The dance is performed by female dancers clad in working clothes and kerchiefs over their heads. Some carry empty shallow baskets while others hold deep baskets filled with grains. The girls with full baskets, in standing position, start to pour grains over the empty baskets of their partners who are sitting on their heels. Dancers shake their baskets so that grains move to the brim and dancers exchange positions. The final part of the rice festival suite is the playful <strong>bayuhan</strong> or the pounding of palay seeds and the <strong>pagtatahip</strong> or winnowing of rice in a&nbsp;<em>bilao&nbsp;</em>(round or square dish made of rattan or bamboo) performed by male and female dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another dance that illustrates the process of growing upland rice is the <strong>eddek</strong>, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> term which means &ldquo;planting techniques.&rdquo; Found in the inner part of Basilan Island, the dance mimics the movements of traditional planting methods such as dispersing seeds in rows or planting seeds by boring holes on the ground. The rice planting process starts with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> called <em>ngubang binihi</em> (offering the first seeds) to ensure abundant harvest. The ritual takes place at the center of an agricultural plot where the Yakan make an altar of green bamboo twigs. The latter is chosen because they want the upland rice to grow tall like bamboo and thus acquire the flexible qualities of the plant, lithely swaying without breaking even with strong winds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An officiating imam sits on the ground facing the altar in a meditative pose, his thumb and middle fingers together. He then selects a rice grain from a receptacle inside the altar, puts it close to his face, utters a silent prayer to the spirits, and proceeds to plant the other seeds on the corners of the altar. Then the farmers start to plant, emulating gestures of the imam. They plant rice with deep respect for the &ldquo;king of the palay&rdquo; so that harvest will be bountiful. Afterwards, the Yakan play the <em>kwintangan kayu</em>, a set of five rounded logs hung horizontally one after another, with the longest on top and the smallest at the bottom. The musical instrument is suspended on a structure of about seven to ten feet high. It may also be placed on a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/248\">tree house</a> or on a house porch near the field. Music making and dancing continue until the seeds grow and bear fruit. Day and night, each musician in the community renders the <em>kadjali</em>, the musical piece played on the kwintangan kayu. Wanting to gratify the spirits of ancestors even more, some play the more difficult <em>tariyat</em>, another musical technique played by seasoned Yakan musicians. The Yakan portray the process of upland rice production through their hand gestures, stances, and footwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a> also have a rice dance called <strong>todak</strong>, named after a bamboo farming tool used in boring holes for seeds planted on slopes. The rice planter is also a piece of art, dyed and incised with geometric patterns, decorated with feathers and bells, and adorned with a <em>pagakpak</em> or bamboo clapper at the top. This occupational dance performed by men and women is also known as <strong>miyamas neng ommoy</strong>, the latter word meaning &ldquo;rice grains without husks.&rdquo; The dance depicts the various stages of Bagobo rice agriculture starting from the clearing of the kaingin, to the digging of small holes using the todak, the dispersal of seeds in the holes, then the harvesting, the threshing, the winnowing, and pounding of rice. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> have a dance on upland rice planting called <strong>talapak</strong>, named after the stick that they use in digging holes on the ground for planting seeds. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> have an upland rice planting cycle composed of distinct dances. The <strong>mabah</strong> is the dance that shows how the farmer looks for a suitable <em>kaingin</em> or swidden plot. The <strong>almigo</strong> portrays how the forest is cleared. The <strong>amla</strong> shows the actual planting of rice which culminates with the <strong>kamto</strong>, the women&rsquo;s dance on rice harvest.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>rigodon de honor</strong> is a formal square dance that follows the strict figures and formations of a quadrille or a square dance as established for the ballroom and grand occasions. A 19th-century record describes the <strong>pas de rigaudon</strong> or <strong>rigaudon</strong> step: a step on the right foot; a throw of the left foot sideways followed by a hop on the right and finishing in first position; a swing of the right leg forward and backward; then a spring of the left foot into fifth position. In Provence, the legs thrust forward and cross. The most important guests, called <em>cabeceras</em>, occupy the width of the room, while the other guests called <em>costados</em> occupy its length.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historical notes on the rigodon, known as the rigaudon in Europe, acknowledge Rigaud, a French dance master from Marseille during the reign of Louis XIII (1601-1643), as the source of the immensely popular dance. The dance must have been introduced to the Philippines by the Spanish colonizers, French and other European visitors, or Filipinos returning from Europe. However, its origin is disputed. Curt Sachs believes that the rigaudon must be related to the Italian <strong>rigondone</strong> and <strong>rigoletto</strong>, or circle dance. He adds that in Languedoc, the rigaudon is the collective name for the dances of southern France and used interchangeably for rigaudon, <strong>bourree</strong>, and <strong>montagnarde</strong>. John Mattheson states in his <em><strong>Der Vollkommene Cappelmeister</strong></em>, 1939, that the name came from <em>rigo</em> or river in Italian. It is believed that Provence, a city close to the Mediterranean, was the conduit to the rest of France. Others, like Sachs, believe it is of peasant origin from Languedoc or Provence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine version is an exceptional dance in purpose, style, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costuming</a>, and figures. Traditionally, it opens prestigious state, national, provincial, community, and exclusive functions, with participation ordained only for a privileged few. It is one of the rare dances that prescribes the use of a <em>terno</em>, the women&rsquo;s national dress. Every participant wears the most fashionable terno or the most intricately hand-embroidered barong tagalog, the men&rsquo;s national shirt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance begins with the announcement of entering couples. In the <strong>abrasete</strong> position, the dancers promenade around the ballroom and finish in their designated places. The <strong>anuncio</strong> that opens the dance is impressive. The cabeceras and costados alternately meet at the center in ordered lines, bow elegantly, and return to their places. Etiquette is rigidly observed through refined bows that precede each figure and whenever opposites meet halfway across the hall. Restrained smiles from the women and a dignified mien for the men are expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire dance is a continuous crisscrossing either with one&rsquo;s partner or that of the opposite pair. Women are fetched by men in different floor patterns and various maneuvers, ending with varied hand positions. The arms are rhythmically and gracefully swung by the side of the body, or are nobly held chest-high when holding the hand of and looking at a partner. They may also be gently swung from right to left. While traveling across the floor, the dancers elegantly strut with small steps that barely leave the floor. The footwork and arms are in cadence to a lilting martial 4/4 time. The different figures of the dance are the anuncio, ladies meet, <strong>zeta</strong> (z-figure), <strong>casamiento</strong> (wedding), <strong>hatid</strong> (escort) or <strong>visita</strong> (visit), <strong>cambio pareja</strong> (change partners), <strong>cadena</strong> (chain), and <strong>cadenilla</strong> (small chain).

				"value": "Historical notes on the rigodon, known as the rigaudon in Europe, acknowledge Rigaud, a French dance master from Marseille during the reign of Louis XIII (1601-1643), as the source of the immensely popular dance. The dance must have been introduced to the Philippines by the Spanish colonizers, French and other European visitors, or Filipinos returning from Europe. However, its origin is disputed. Curt Sachs believes that the rigaudon must be related to the Italian <strong>rigondone</strong> and <strong>rigoletto</strong>, or circle dance. He adds that in Languedoc, the rigaudon is the collective name for the dances of southern France and used interchangeably for rigaudon, <strong>bourree</strong>, and <strong>montagnarde</strong>. John Mattheson states in his <em><strong>Der Vollkommene Cappelmeister</strong></em>, 1939, that the name came from <em>rigo</em> or river in Italian. It is believed that Provence, a city close to the Mediterranean, was the conduit to the rest of France. Others, like Sachs, believe it is of peasant origin from Languedoc or Provence."

Traditionally, it opens prestigious state, national, provincial, community, and exclusive functions, with participation ordained only for a privileged few. It is one of the rare dances that prescribes the use of a <em>terno</em>, the women&#x2019;s national dress.

The <strong>anuncio</strong> that opens the dance is impressive. The cabeceras and costados alternately meet at the center in ordered lines, bow elegantly, and return to their places. Etiquette is rigidly observed through refined bows that precede each figure and whenever opposites meet halfway across the hall. Restrained smiles from the women and a dignified mien for the men are expected."

Women are fetched by men in different floor patterns and various maneuvers, ending with varied hand positions. The arms are rhythmically and gracefully swung by the side of the body, or are nobly held chest-high when holding the hand of and looking at a partner. They may also be gently swung from right to left. While traveling across the floor, the dancers elegantly strut with small steps that barely leave the floor. The footwork and arms are in cadence to a lilting martial 4/4 time. The different figures of the dance are the anuncio, ladies meet, <strong>zeta</strong> (z-figure), <strong>casamiento</strong> (wedding), <strong>hatid</strong> (escort) or <strong>visita</strong> (visit), <strong>cambio pareja</strong> (change partners), <strong>cadena</strong> (chain), and <strong>cadenilla</strong> (small chain). The cadena is played to the music of &#x201C;Zamboanga,&#x201D; a catchy melody in 2/4 time. This figure gives everyone a chance to be seen closely by spectators in different parts of the ballroom.

An other-worldly being called <em>anito</em> is honored by certain animist groups with drinking, dancing, and singing. The term <em>diwata</em> (guardian spirit/goddess), may have come from the Hindi-Sanskrit word <em>devata</em>, referring to a goddess or good spirit. The polytheist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> have countless <em>bagales</em> or deities, some of whom are Kabunyan, the Supreme Being, and Manilonda, their ancestors. Other groups have their own set of numerous divinities, for each of whom they perform different rites.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Leading the ritual activities is the shaman, who is known by various names, depending on the indigenous group: <em>babaylan</em> or <em>baylan</em>, <em>balyan</em>, <em>catalonan</em>, <em>katalman</em>, <em>walian</em>, <em>marayawan</em>, <em>manibunong</em>, <em>mambunong</em>, <em>mumbuni</em>, <em>mumbaki</em>, <em>mandadawak</em>, <em>manalisig</em>, <em>pari</em>, <em>albularyo</em>, <em>erbularyo</em>, <em>maningbulong</em>, <em>manugtambal</em>, <em>manggagamot</em>, or <em>imam</em>. Male or female, the shaman acts as medium between the people and the spirits, going into a trance as the spirits being supplicated take possession of them in order to partake of the ritual offerings. The ritual itself is known by various names: <strong>pag-ampo</strong> (Visayan); <strong>anituan</strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a>); <strong>anito baylan</strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>); <strong>diwata</strong>, <strong>pagdiwata</strong>, <strong>inim</strong>, <strong>karatong</strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a>); <strong>mag-anito</strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>); <strong>marayaw</strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a>); and <strong>palinawa</strong> or <strong>dawak</strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>). The dances in the rituals are usually performed principally by the shaman who goes into a trance. Sometimes the people themselves dance as part of the ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ifugao have the following rituals with dances: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/52\"><strong>dinuy-a</strong></a>, a festival to thank the gods for a good harvest; the <strong>bumajah</strong>, a medium-sized ritual of thanksgiving with much dancing; and the <strong>uyaoy</strong>/<strong>uyaoya</strong>, which is a dance to ask the gods for good fortune, a bountiful harvest, and to bless a wedding. There is also much food, dancing, music, and singing of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1877\"><em><strong>Hudhud</strong></em></a> at night. The uyaoy for wealthy people may use <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>. <strong>Bunilbaki</strong> is a rice festival, with prayer, animal sacrifice, and vigorous dancing. It is for illness, thanksgiving, and well-being, and is led by mumbaki priests. The Kalinga <strong>palinawa</strong> is a dance of the mandadawak or priestess who uses a china bowl to catch floating hair in the air, after someone has died tragically, whose strands she then puts on the heads of the bereaved. Another death ritual practiced by the Kalinga is the <strong>bikbik-sagsag</strong>, a ritual performed only by women and the mandadawak with burning branches to drive the spirit of the dead into the world beyond. Other Kalinga dance rituals are the <strong>dawak</strong>, <strong>sis-siwa</strong>, and <strong>sapoy</strong>. The <strong>dalidog</strong> bids farewell to dead warriors. The Kalinga <strong>gabook</strong> is a ritual dance performed to welcome a newborn baby, especially a boy.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Itneg, the ritual of supplication is the <strong>daing</strong>. One of several <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> daing rites performed by several men and led by a mandadawak asks for rain. A pig is carried around a dry field, its ears occasionally touched with burning straws; its cry is believed to reach the gods. The pig is later sacrificed. Prayers supplicated are celebrated in the <strong>palook</strong>, a thanksgiving dance for a good harvest. The Benguet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/105\"><strong>tayaw</strong></a> is a sacrificial rite where a mambunong or priestess of Kabunyan leads people in offering pigs to the gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Aeta <strong>amba</strong>, men circle the sick, shout, run, walk, and threaten malevolent spirits so they will leave. In the <strong>anituan</strong>, another Aeta healing ritual, several shamans encourage and later threaten the spirits so they will leave the patient, who is covered with a red cloth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practiced among the southern communities are several rituals with dance component. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/54\"><strong>dugso</strong></a> is a dance performed at harvest time, upon the birth of a male heir, or in supplication. The <strong>inahaw</strong> is a dance offering by the Bukidnon where females move around a sacred fire. An example of a work-a-day ritual is the Bukidnon <strong>tadag</strong> where a babaylan requests permission from nature spirits to clear the woods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a> <strong>gin-um</strong> requires human sacrifice to satisfy the god of life and death and other deities. But it is also performed for thanksgiving when the rice granaries are full, after victory in battle, as well as for driving away evil spirits, and asking for wealth. The Bagobo <strong>pamalugu</strong> is a ritual bath in the river where dancers are sprinkled with water by a priestess. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2364\">Mansaka</a> <strong>munsayaw</strong> is a ceremony presided over by a man disguised as a female shaman to attract the diwata. The Talaingod <strong>baboy</strong> is a dance performed by a village shaman using a sacrificial pig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> are the <strong>sinuyad</strong>, a ritual where the diwata heals the sick through a dancing priestess, and the <strong>sinundo</strong>/<strong>sinungga</strong>, a dance exorcism of a disease-bearing evil spirit. The <strong>sinaliling</strong> is a ritual where a baylan requests a spirit to transfer the disease of a person to the sacrificial chicken and some eggs. The <strong>say-am</strong> is a major feast where a priestess communicates with the spirits. The <strong>manganito</strong> is a ceremonial element of this ritual. The <strong>dalidog</strong> is for warriors who feel protected by the bloodthirsty war god Tagbusaw. Captured enemies are sacrificed. Today, the dance is a sublimation of the bloody rite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tagbanwa <strong>runsay</strong>, where offerings are placed on a raft and sent on the ocean to the deities of the sea, is done every third night after the last full moon of the year, by a medium and other participants. The <strong>tarek</strong> is like the <strong>tugatak</strong>, <strong>karatong</strong>, and <strong>tegupat</strong>, and is a dance of the babaylan or priestess. The <strong>diwata</strong>/<strong>pagdiwata</strong> is an important ritual, led by a priestess who calls on the great spirit, Magindusa. It involves dances, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chants</a>, music, and healing sequences. Another Tagbanwa ritual is the <strong>inim</strong>, a sequence in the pagdiwata wherein the priestess drinks <em>tabad</em> (rice wine) after the spirits have &ldquo;drunk.&rdquo; Public dancing follows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> practice the <strong>bolang-bolang</strong>, a sacrificial rite where participants move around a pole in supplication; the <strong>lapal</strong>, a ritual where a medium asks for permission to make a forest clearing; the <strong>binua-bua</strong>, a shaman dance and rite performed for barren women; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/47\"><strong>buklog</strong></a>, the most important ritual of the Subanon, which is celebrated to give thanks for a good harvest, to celebrate shared prosperity, or to deflect illness or misfortune. In this elaborate ritual, a whole community dances in a circle around a pole that is pounded against a mortar below a high suspended floor on which everyone congregates and dances. Food and wine are offered to and shared with, the spirits, accompanied by incantations from the shaman. The communal dance progresses counterclockwise, the dancers stepping sideways, and over and under the right foot, assuming a very celebratory mood which contrasts with the serious mien of the babaylan. In the Mandaya tradition, the <strong>anito baylan</strong> has a female shaman in a trance chanting and shuffling around the sick, trying to contact the Mandaya environmental gods, whose presence is induced by the dancing, gong and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a> playing, and chanting. The same ritual is practiced among the Mansaka where a male shaman leads the sacrifice of a chicken and uses a human skull. Later, young female onlookers dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intriguing ritual dances are performed with piety and earnestness in the Sulu Archipelago. <strong>Magjuwata</strong> from South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi drives away spirits that cause illness; likewise the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> <strong>pagjinn</strong> held during the full moon, <strong>magpugot</strong> from Musu, and <strong>magsalba</strong> from Bulikulul, both in Siasi. Female participants wear the traditional garments consisting of the <em>sablay</em> (loose blouse with long sleeves) and <em>patadjung</em> (wrap-around skirt) or a <em>sawwal kantiu&nbsp;</em>(loose trousers). The latter is for men and women. Male performers may wear a <em>badju</em> (loose skirt) and a <em>pis</em> (headkerchief) as desired. The ritual dance is believed to appease the spirits called <em>apo-jin</em>. It also prays for a good catch, easy childbirth, long life, peaceful death, or a happy trip to heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also ritual dances of Hispanic influence. The <strong>sayaw sa obando</strong> of Bulacan features men and women dancing on the streets during the procession of the images of Santa Clara, San Pascual Baylon, and the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Salambao either to ask for children, husbands, or wives. The <strong>turumba sa Birhen</strong> of Laguna is a procession by devotees dancing to petition or thank the Virgin for diverse reasons, among them relief for the sick. In the <strong>sanghiyang</strong> of Cavite, performers walk over live coals after a series of prayers. The <strong>sinulog</strong>, also referred to as <strong>sinug</strong> or <strong>sinurog</strong>, is regarded as the premier <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk religious dance</a> in the Visayas. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> <strong>ohong-ohong</strong> is a festival dance performed in long formation, and accompanied by a song which may be sung by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">audience</a>. The <strong>gapnod</strong> is a worship dance of Sibulan, Negros Oriental which begins with a reenactment and celebration of the discovery of the image of San Antonio de Padua, patron saint of Sibulan, by a fisherman, and ends with a fluvial procession along the coast.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2547\">Ramon A.

Another death ritual practiced by the Kalinga is the <strong>bikbik-sagsag</strong>, a ritual performed only by women and the mandadawak with burning branches to drive the spirit of the dead into the world beyond. Other Kalinga dance rituals are the <strong>dawak</strong>, <strong>sis-siwa</strong>, and <strong>sapoy</strong>. The <strong>dalidog</strong> bids farewell to dead warriors.

The dance traces its origins to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><em><strong>Darangen</strong></em></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> in preparation for battle performed by the epic hero Bantugan. It portrays the ways in which Bantugan wears his battle gears and weapons. The Maranao consider it a royal dance because it dramatizes Bantugan&rsquo;s preparation to rescue his sister Lawanen in an episode in the epic called <em><strong>Kalid a Dempas</strong></em>. Bantugan puts on his headgear called <em>kapasiti</em> or <em>kapasti</em> which is decorated with mirrors. Then he slips into his rainbow-colored attire. He tries out his <em>klung</em> or <em>klong</em>, a shield carved from hardwood attached with bells. He holds his shining <em>kampilan</em> or double-edged sword and moves gracefully by turning and going from side to side. The epic hero recites prayers invoking the help of guardian spirits with each move. During the conduct of the war, Bantugan cannot see his enemies but is guided only by the rattling sound of their klung.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emulating the heroism of Bantugan, the Maguindanao and the Maranao consider this dance a testament to their honor, nobility, and bravery. Performers of the dance are also called sagayan who represent fierce warriors sporting the kampilan and colorful klung festooned with shells. On top of ankle-fitting pants, sagayan dancers wear a three-layered skirt of red, yellow, and green. Their kapasiti have decorations like flowers, mirrors, reflectors, tassels, and feathers. But the elaborate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume</a> is perhaps a recent evolution since photos of Maguindanao warriors and sagayan dancers in the Spanish and American colonial periods show them wearing metal vests with skirts and less elaborate headgears decorated with traditional designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several sagayan variants with different social meanings ranging from secular performances to spiritual dancing. In the Maguindanaon <em>kuyog</em> or royal parade, sagayan serves as the opening ritual to drive away malevolent spirits and negative energies through the sword movements and noises from the klung&rsquo;s shells. One ritualistic variant is called <strong>sambuyog a malna</strong>, performed in the <em>kapagipat</em> healing ritual to appease the source of the disease&mdash;either&nbsp;<em>saitan&nbsp;</em>(malignant spirits) or the&nbsp;<em>tunong&nbsp;</em>(ancestral spirits). This sagayan version uses graceful and definitive movements with spiritual meanings. It is performed by male and/or female shamans who move as if they were in a duel. They are believed to be possessed by the tunong in the <em><strong>Darangen</strong></em> epic, such as the souls of the rival siblings Balatamay Lumena and Alongan Pidsayana. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dancing</a>, accompanied with percussion music of the kulintang, also symbolizes the defeat of evil and the cleansing of the self and the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the more common Maguindanao variant associated with war dance is <strong>sagayan dalkat</strong>. The sagayan dancer must possess strength and flexibility to execute the combinations of jumps, turns, leaps, and butterfly kicks according to the energetic rhythm of kulintang or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a>. He combines quick and forceful movements of the head, accompanied with fast hip jiggles and the forceful handling of the klung and the kampilan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Maranao, sagayan is a sacred ritual in preparation for a battle. The warrior or sagayan invokes protection from Allah against all kinds of harm after which he proceeds to sharpen his weapons and wear his multi-colored top, trousers, and skirt. He puts on his elaborate headgear and sits to meditate, sometimes checking on the sharpness of his kampilan on his own body until he fastens the sword oriented to the west. Incense burns in front of the warrior to put him in a trance. Then he rises and chants out loud, asking for guidance in the battle and seeking total surrender to Allah&rsquo;s grace. Then the sagayan jumps and brandishes his kampilan in a freewheeling manner, as if attacking an invisible opponent. The duration of the dance lasts until the trance is completed. Thereafter, he sits calmly awaiting the entrance of the <em>bailabi</em> or most noble woman of the community. She gives pieces of advice in the form of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chant</a> accompanied with movements using two beautiful fans. She counsels the sagayan to free himself from hatred and to commit to the deeper goal of fighting for kith and kin. After the encounter with the bailabi, the sagayan resumes his dancing to signify that he is now ready to deal with his adversaries. There is another Maranao version called <strong>sagayan kulong</strong> that has many performers doing a mock battle among one another or against unseen opponents, the tunong. The warriors chant in order to bring about the state of trance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sagayan dancing is an important part of the Araw ng Lanao del Norte Celebration when all municipalities of the province participate in the event. In Maguindanao province, the Sagayan Festival was started in 2011 and organized by Governor Esmael Mangudadatu. The governor was elected into office after the heinous 2009 Maguindanao massacre in which 58 people were murdered, including the governor&rsquo;s wife. The Maguindanao provincial board passed a resolution institutionalizing the festival as a yearly event to promote important values among the people. The dance symbolizes the Maguindanao pledge to protect their communities from invaders or from exploiters. The dance also expresses resilience among the Maguindanao to rise from any adversity.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

		"text": "<p><strong>Sayaw sa bangko</strong> or <strong>sayaw ed tapew na bangko</strong> is a dance originating in Pangasinan performed by a barefoot couple, usually male and female and is done, as the name suggests, on top of a bench. An early <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documentation</a> of the dance was done by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a>, in the locality of Pangapisan, Lingayen. The only <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">prop</a> needed is a well-built bench that has no backrest, commonly called a carpenter&rsquo;s bench. The simple bench should be able to carry the weight of two dancers. It is quite narrow, measuring six to seven inches, and has an average length of two to three yards. Its elevation is about two feet but may vary depending on the height of the dancers. Originally, the girl dons a <em>camisa</em> (loose blouse) over a skirt with an extended tail whose tip is tucked at the waist to allow easy movement. The boy sports a <em>camisa de chino</em> (loose collarless shirt) over a pair of colored pants. Music is in 2/4 and 3/4 time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance requires strength, agility, coordination, and balance. It begins with the girl standing at the right of the boy in front of the bench. When music begins, the male dancer mounts the bench and assists the female dancer who may hop or step up the bench. Partners assume a ballroom dance position and bow to the audience with a three-step turn in place. The performance has four figures with increasing difficulty in movement. In all figures, the girl and boy hold hands in various ways which is necessary to maintain balance and coordination between the partners.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The first figure consists of change steps with partners in a ballroom dance position moving through the length of the bench and turning clockwise to exchange places on the narrow surface. The second figure combines the coordinated hops, kicks, and jumps of the partners, exchanging places while executing these. Then they join palms of hands and perform an outward three-step turn. The third figure shows the fine footwork of the dance. The couple performs small change steps toward the end of the bench where partners carefully exchange places through small steps on the balls of the feet, which is necessary lest they fall off the narrow dancing area. The couple repeats this combination as they move to the other end of the bench. The fourth figure begins with change steps in preparation for exchanging places through playful hops. The combination is repeated to return to proper places. Then partners hold hands to alternately skip with each foot, swinging the elevated leg sideways in a lighthearted manner. For the final bow, girl and boy hold each other with inside hands, then make a three-step turn inward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sayaw sa bangko is a fun-filled dance usually performed by only one couple on one bench. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">Folk dance</a> groups led by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a> revised the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a> by adding more couples who rearrange many benches through the dance. Partners jump up and down through increasing levels of benches mounted on top of one another, reaching the height of four elevations. This version is replete with stunts to create suspense. The tall pyramid of benches is a big departure from the single bench in the rustic sayaw ed tapew na bangko. In the 2000s, the acrobatic version has become very popular and widely imitated by folk dance groups in the country and abroad. Tricks have been added, like using blindfolds on the dancer who will execute the jumps at the highest elevation to make the performance a daring and dangerous feat calculated to thrill spectators. A number of performers and critics, however, think that the addition of sensational tricks has turned the dance into something like a circus act.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

		"text": "<div id=\"video_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Singkil</strong> is the most famous dance of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> ethnic group in Lanao del Sur. The word &ldquo;singkil,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;hurdling,&rdquo; is also the name of the dancer&rsquo;s brass anklets and bells that clink while the dancer steps over a series of twin bamboo poles on the ground. The poles are rhythmically clapped together to produce a musical beat. The sound of the brass accessories helps the dancer to keep pace with the rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Singkil is perhaps the best example of a dance that has undergone great theatrical modifications since 1958, when it became a sensation at the Brussels Universal Exposition. At the time, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a> presented an all-female version that highlighted a princess with a female attendant stepping in between clapping bamboo poles. The all-female version was first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">researched</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2487\">Henrietta Hofer</a> together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\">Lucrecia Urtula</a> who was Bayanihan&rsquo;s dance director in the mid-1950s. Their main informant was Princess Tarhata Alonto of Lanao who used to dance singkil with three fans held by each hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The overwhelming response to the dance made singkil the Bayanihan&rsquo;s signature <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a>, earning for the group airtime on American television and three months on Broadway. The success of singkil encouraged Bayanihan to alter the original presentation. In the 1959 Broadway performances, Bayanihan added a male dancer representing Bantugan, the hero in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\">Darangen</a>, along with a male entourage. The inclusion of male dancers drew criticism from among the Maranao because, traditionally, male and female dancers are forbidden to dance together. In fact, in the traditional singkil, the bamboo poles are held by women because of this taboo. Moreover, some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a> disapproved of Bayanihan&rsquo;s changes that gave no credit to the Maguindanao who claim to have a singkil version with a prince trying to woo a princess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origin of singkil is unclear. Even the tale of Princess Gandingan, heroine of the Darangen epic who is said to be the lead female character in singkil, has several versions. One story tells of an incident when several <em>diwata</em> (guardian spirits) played a trick on her. While walking through a forest, the diwata caused earth tremors that knocked down trees and rocks which were strewn along her path. The calm Gandingan just nimbly hopped to safety. The rapping of bamboo poles in singkil represents the upheaval caused by the earthquake. In the Bayanihan version, the diwata wanted to protect Princess Gandingan from Bantugan who was pursuing the princess. The diwata triggered an earthquake to obstruct Bantugan&rsquo;s path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original singkil, so to speak, was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/32\">documented</a> by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2445\">Darangan Cultural Dance Troupe</a> in 1963 during field research at Rumayas Maguing and Taluan in the town of Lumba a Bayabao, Lanao del Sur. There are four basic elements in the dance. First is the <strong>ksadoratan</strong> footwork which is a regal walk in a gliding manner through a careful changing of weight from right foot to left, accompanied by the slow turning of the head from right to left with downcast eyes or oblique glances. Second is the singkil footwork which consists of the steps used in going in between and outside the bamboo poles. Third element is the pause, done with weight on the right foot while the left foot is positioned in front. The fourth element is made up of fan manipulations by both right and left hand which accompany the ksadoratan footwork, the singkil steps, and the pause. The measure of a good dancer is on how she can combine beautiful ways to move the fans during each pause and while executing singkil and ksadoratan steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The field research at Rumayas Maguing and Taluan was able to document what is perhaps the closest to singkil&rsquo;s primordial version, performed solo by a woman, and rarely, by two women. It only uses two bamboo poles placed parallel each other on the floor. The performance starts with the dancer seated on a chair, singing the <strong>bayok</strong> or love song with two fans held by each hand. She places the left hand, holding the open fans, at the waist level while the right hand sways the fans forward and backward. Then she moves the fans alternately with a figure of eight circling from the wrist. Next, her arms move to shoulder level, with fans facing downward parallel to floor at face level, followed by the movement of the fans in figure of eight. At the end of the bayok, the performer stands with fans held sideward at shoulder level and dances toward the bamboo poles using ksadoratan steps. Upon reaching the poles, the dancer drops two fans, retaining one fan held by each hand. Then she performs the singkil footwork while waving the fans in figure of eight, which may be executed from waist to shoulder level in sideward and forward directions. Singkil steps may be spontaneously done in several directions&mdash;diagonal, vertical, or circular. The dancer decides when to end and exit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second version of singkil, as documented in the 1963 field research, involves only a female dancer dancing with two fans, held with the left and the right hand. Twin poles, eight in all, are arranged in a quadrangle. The dancer performs ksadoratan steps while outside the poles and shifts to singkil steps to go in and out of the clapping poles. The pause is important before changing direction. During each pause, the dancer can move the fans in many ways&mdash;forward and backward, figure of eight, or wave-like movements up and down. She may change how the fans are held to position them perpendicular to the body. She may also do other variations like flipping the fans alternately. The dance ends when the performer is done passing through all the sides of the quadrangle using singkil and ksadoratan steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third version documented in Lumba a Bayabao utilizes two twin poles that intersect at the middle, producing a square at the center of the cross formation. Two dancers hold fans with each hand using the thumb and index fingers. The dancers take opposite positions of the square at the center of the cross. Performance commences when both dancers do three stomps and a pause, repeated thrice. This is followed by singkil and ksadoratan steps through the clapping poles. They simultaneously execute fan techniques while stepping in and out of the crisscrossed poles. It is important that the two dancers improvise combinations of steps and fan techniques that are different from each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bamboo poles used in the dance should be about seven feet long and two inches in diameter. Singkil may have no musical accompaniment but the clapping sound of bamboo in 4/4 time, complemented by the sound of stomping feet and tinkling anklets. It may also be performed with musical instruments like a <em>kotiyapi</em> (bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>), <em>insi</em> (bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\"><em>kobing</em></a> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>), or <em>tintikan</em> (two small metal sticks). Female dancers wear a tubular skirt called <em>malong</em> over a fitted or loose blouse with either long or 3/4 sleeves. Each dancer carries at least one pair of accordion hand fans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three National Artists for dance imparted their individual interpretations of singkil. Lucrecia Urtula&rsquo;s creation is described in the aforementioned Bayanihan version. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2547\">Ramon Obusan</a>&rsquo;s choreography opens with a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> and interprets it as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">wedding dance</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> wrote that the dance has two versions, one for royal women and one for common folks. The version for royalty is performed strictly by aristocratic ladies featuring a princess with an assistant holding an ornamental umbrella. The singkil version for common folks is performed by male and female natives who do not belong to the nobility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 1950s to the 2000s, the stylized singkil remained as one of the most iconic dances of the Philippines. It is an indispensable part of the Muslim Mindanao Suite performed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> groups in the Philippines and abroad. Its elaborate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">production design</a> is a favorite choice to showcase Philippine culture, as exemplified by Miss World title holder Megan Young, who danced singkil in the 2013 Miss World beauty pageant.

The word &#x201C;singkil,&#x201D; which means &#x201C;hurdling,&#x201D; is also the name of the dancer&#x2019;s brass anklets and bells that clink while the dancer steps over a series of twin bamboo poles on the ground. The poles are rhythmically clapped together to produce a musical beat. The sound of the brass accessories helps the dancer to keep pace with the rhythm."

				"value": "Singkil is perhaps the best example of a dance that has undergone great theatrical modifications since 1958, when it became a sensation at the Brussels Universal Exposition. At the time, the <a href=\"/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a> presented an all-female version that highlighted a princess with a female attendant stepping in between clapping bamboo poles. The all-female version was first <a href=\"/6/47/32\">researched</a> by <a href=\"/6/51/2487\">Henrietta Hofer</a> together with <a href=\"/6/51/2571\">Lucrecia Urtula</a> who was Bayanihan&#x2019;s dance director in the mid-1950s. Their main informant was Princess Tarhata Alonto of Lanao who used to dance singkil with three fans held by each hand."

				"value": "The overwhelming response to the dance made singkil the Bayanihan&#x2019;s signature <a href=\"/6/47/26\">choreography</a>, earning for the group airtime on American television and three months on Broadway. The success of singkil encouraged Bayanihan to alter the original presentation. In the 1959 Broadway performances, Bayanihan added a male dancer representing Bantugan, the hero in the <a href=\"/9/73/1549\">epic</a> <a href=\"/9/78/1858\">Darangen</a>, along with a male entourage. The inclusion of male dancers drew criticism from among the Maranao because, traditionally, male and female dancers are forbidden to dance together. In fact, in the traditional singkil, the bamboo poles are held by women because of this taboo. Moreover, some <a href=\"/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a> disapproved of Bayanihan&#x2019;s changes that gave no credit to the Maguindanao who claim to have a singkil version with a prince trying to woo a princess."

				"value": "The origin of singkil is unclear. Even the tale of Princess Gandingan, heroine of the Darangen epic who is said to be the lead female character in singkil, has several versions. One story tells of an incident when several <em>diwata</em> (guardian spirits) played a trick on her. While walking through a forest, the diwata caused earth tremors that knocked down trees and rocks which were strewn along her path. The calm Gandingan just nimbly hopped to safety. The rapping of bamboo poles in singkil represents the upheaval caused by the earthquake. In the Bayanihan version, the diwata wanted to protect Princess Gandingan from Bantugan who was pursuing the princess. The diwata triggered an earthquake to obstruct Bantugan&#x2019;s path."

				"value": "The original singkil, so to speak, was <a href=\"/6/47/32\">documented</a> by the <a href=\"/6/51/2445\">Darangan Cultural Dance Troupe</a> in 1963 during field research at Rumayas Maguing and Taluan in the town of Lumba a Bayabao, Lanao del Sur. There are four basic elements in the dance. First is the <strong>ksadoratan</strong> footwork which is a regal walk in a gliding manner through a careful changing of weight from right foot to left, accompanied by the slow turning of the head from right to left with downcast eyes or oblique glances. Second is the singkil footwork which consists of the steps used in going in between and outside the bamboo poles. Third element is the pause, done with weight on the right foot while the left foot is positioned in front. The fourth element is made up of fan manipulations by both right and left hand which accompany the ksadoratan footwork, the singkil steps, and the pause. The measure of a good dancer is on how she can combine beautiful ways to move the fans during each pause and while executing singkil and ksadoratan steps."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The field research at Rumayas Maguing and Taluan was able to document what is perhaps the closest to singkil&#x2019;s primordial version, performed solo by a woman, and rarely, by two women. It only uses two bamboo poles placed parallel each other on the floor. The performance starts with the dancer seated on a chair, singing the <strong>bayok</strong> or love song with two fans held by each hand. She places the left hand, holding the open fans, at the waist level while the right hand sways the fans forward and backward. Then she moves the fans alternately with a figure of eight circling from the wrist. Next, her arms move to shoulder level, with fans facing downward parallel to floor at face level, followed by the movement of the fans in figure of eight. At the end of the bayok, the performer stands with fans held sideward at shoulder level and dances toward the bamboo poles using ksadoratan steps. Upon reaching the poles, the dancer drops two fans, retaining one fan held by each hand. Then she performs the singkil footwork while waving the fans in figure of eight, which may be executed from waist to shoulder level in sideward and forward directions. Singkil steps may be spontaneously done in several directions&#x2014;diagonal, vertical, or circular. The dancer decides when to end and exit."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The second version of singkil, as documented in the 1963 field research, involves only a female dancer dancing with two fans, held with the left and the right hand. Twin poles, eight in all, are arranged in a quadrangle. The dancer performs ksadoratan steps while outside the poles and shifts to singkil steps to go in and out of the clapping poles. The pause is important before changing direction. During each pause, the dancer can move the fans in many ways&#x2014;forward and backward, figure of eight, or wave-like movements up and down. She may change how the fans are held to position them perpendicular to the body. She may also do other variations like flipping the fans alternately. The dance ends when the performer is done passing through all the sides of the quadrangle using singkil and ksadoratan steps."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The third version documented in Lumba a Bayabao utilizes two twin poles that intersect at the middle, producing a square at the center of the cross formation. Two dancers hold fans with each hand using the thumb and index fingers. The dancers take opposite positions of the square at the center of the cross. Performance commences when both dancers do three stomps and a pause, repeated thrice. This is followed by singkil and ksadoratan steps through the clapping poles. They simultaneously execute fan techniques while stepping in and out of the crisscrossed poles. It is important that the two dancers improvise combinations of steps and fan techniques that are different from each other."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Bamboo poles used in the dance should be about seven feet long and two inches in diameter. Singkil may have no musical accompaniment but the clapping sound of bamboo in 4/4 time, complemented by the sound of stomping feet and tinkling anklets. It may also be performed with musical instruments like a <em>kotiyapi</em> (bamboo <a href=\"/5/37/811\">guitar</a>), <em>insi</em> (bamboo <a href=\"/5/37/809\">flute</a>), <a href=\"/5/37/817\"><em>kobing</em></a> (<a href=\"/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>), or <em>tintikan</em> (two small metal sticks). Female dancers wear a tubular skirt called <em>malong</em> over a fitted or loose blouse with either long or 3/4 sleeves. Each dancer carries at least one pair of accordion hand fans."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Three National Artists for dance imparted their individual interpretations of singkil. Lucrecia Urtula&#x2019;s creation is described in the aforementioned Bayanihan version. <a href=\"/6/51/2547\">Ramon Obusan</a>&#x2019;s choreography opens with a <a href=\"/7/55/469\">ritual</a> and interprets it as a <a href=\"/6/46/49\">wedding dance</a>. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/6/51/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> wrote that the dance has two versions, one for royal women and one for common folks. The version for royalty is performed strictly by aristocratic ladies featuring a princess with an assistant holding an ornamental umbrella. The singkil version for common folks is performed by male and female natives who do not belong to the nobility."

				"value": "From the 1950s to the 2000s, the stylized singkil remained as one of the most iconic dances of the Philippines. It is an indispensable part of the Muslim Mindanao Suite performed by <a href=\"/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> groups in the Philippines and abroad. Its elaborate <a href=\"/6/47/29\">production design</a> is a favorite choice to showcase Philippine culture, as exemplified by Miss World title holder Megan Young, who danced singkil in the 2013 Miss World beauty pageant. The innumerable reinventions of singkil staged worldwide are devoid of the dance&#x2019;s original context and meaning in Maranao culture. Nevertheless, it has become a symbol of Filipino identity and has given Filipinos who know little about the Philippine archipelago&#x2019;s pre-colonial culture and history a sense of pride in cultural heritage.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span></strong>"

		"text": "<p>Social dancing is principally performed among ethnic or hispanized groups to celebrate the landmarks in the cycle of life, such as births, baptisms, and weddings; to mark harvests of rice or fish, victory in war, and in the case of Christian areas, the feasts of patron saints or the visit of important personages. Some of the earliest examples of social dances among the indigenous groups are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/52\"><strong>dinuy-a</strong></a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> and the <strong>among</strong> and <strong>palok</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>. With a droning, steady tempo provided by percussion instruments and the simplest of steps, these dances invite participation from the crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a> of Davao Oriental dance the <strong>gimbaw</strong> at informal gatherings to the beat of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a> of the same name. On the island of Cagayan de Sulu, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2354\">Jama Mapun</a> dance the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/69\"><strong>lunsay</strong></a>, a community dance of varying tempo, from dusk to dawn. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> of Palawan dance the <strong>andardi</strong> on special occasions, a moderately paced dance with simple steps and repeated figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spaniards brought not only Christianity, but also the ballroom dances of Europe in the 16th century. Dances like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><strong>fandango</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\"><strong>jota</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\"><strong>habanera</strong></a> were introduced by the colonizers, and adapted to local taste and conditions, with almost every region or town evolving their own versions of these dances. There are versions of the fandango in Ilocos Norte, the Visayas, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> region. The jota can be <strong>batangue&ntilde;a</strong>, <strong>bicolana</strong>, <strong>cagayana</strong>, <strong>ilocana</strong>, <strong>Pangasinan</strong>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/72\"><strong>mazurka</strong></a> can be <strong>boholana</strong>, <strong>de Jaen</strong>, or <strong>mindore&ntilde;a</strong>. All these are danced during town fiestas and religious holidays, as well as in purely social gatherings such as weddings, baptisms, and birthdays.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, other European dances were introduced to the Philippines. Important social events occasioned the performances of such imports like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/90\"><strong>rigodon</strong></a> (France), the <strong>redova</strong> (Czechoslovakia), the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\"><strong>polka</strong></a> (Bohemia and Czechoslovakia), the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/55\"><strong>schottische</strong></a> (Germany), the <strong>ba-Ingles</strong> (England), and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><strong>lanceros</strong></a> (French and English, by way of America). These dances were brought over by visiting foreigners and returning Filipino students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the lower classes were barred from social interactions with the Spaniards and mestizos during the Spanish colonial period, they nevertheless copied what they saw of the new dances and improvised the rest. The schottische became the <strong>escotis</strong> and the <strong>chotis</strong>, the polka became <strong>polka sa nayon</strong> or <strong>polka sala</strong>, and the fandango became <strong>pandanggo sa ilaw</strong> and <strong>pandanggo sa sambalilo</strong>. The lower classes also produced dances in the Spanish style and manner, but purely Filipino in character such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a>, <strong>sinisiki</strong>, <strong>magkasuyo</strong>, <strong>karakal</strong>, <strong>maramyon</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/65\"><strong>kuradang</strong></a>, <strong>magtipan</strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/66\"><strong>kuratsa</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American occupation, with its sweeping institutional changes, brought with it a new concept in social dancing. Social dance became its own reason for being and Filipinos absorbed the new dance forms with the same ease that they absorbed other American influences. Social dance in the Philippines has since closely followed American trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1920s, Filipinos danced the charleston; during the 1930s, they did the jitterbug and some South American styles; by the 1940s and 1950s they were adept at the mambo, samba, and cha-cha. The 1950s also brought the boogie-woogie and countless rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll styles. The 1960s saw the twist, frug, camel walk, shy tuna, aqua velva, escalator, shimmy, and boogaloo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently, nationalism has renewed interest in traditional dance forms. Many dancers and choreographers now incorporate movements and Filipino traditions of social dance in modern <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreography</a>. Thus, jota and pandanggo movements have been incorporated in performances such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/112\"><em><strong>Amada</strong></em></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2418\">Julie Borromeo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/206\"><em><strong>Zagalas de Manila</strong></em></a> (Young Maidens of Manila).<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by David Bercades</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p id=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/442\"><strong>Balitaw</strong></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/55\"><strong>Escotis/Chotis/Schottische</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/777\"><strong>Habanera</strong></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/780\"><strong>Jota</strong></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/66\"><strong>Kuratsa</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/72\"><strong>Mazurka</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/787\"><strong>Pandanggo</strong></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/789\"><strong>Polka</strong></a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/792\"><strong>Rigodon</strong></a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Alejandro, Reynaldo G. 1972.<em>Sayaw Silangan: The Dance in</em><em>the Philippines</em>.

		"text": "<p>A <strong>song dance</strong> is a dance performed to the lyrics of a song whose meaning is often acted out in gestures and other movements. The songs may describe a community&rsquo;s history, character, and traditions. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> of Palawan dance the <strong>andardi</strong>, whose performers sing and dance to the beat of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a> and other percussion instruments. Although a festival dance, the andardi is also performed to while away the dancer&rsquo;s time. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/69\"><strong>lunsay</strong></a> is a song and dance of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2354\">Jama Mapun</a> of Cagayan de Sulu aka Mapun Municipality. Similarly, the <strong>suasua</strong> (literally, a small orange or pomelo plant) is performed with a song. The <strong>dalling-dalling</strong> is a comic song dance popular in Sulu and Tawi-Tawi: in the song, the boy may say that he has no peace of mind while away from his love, and the girl may respond that her love will never change though they are miles away from each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the dances of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> is the <strong>abaruray</strong>, in which a man&nbsp;and woman act out a courtship. The Tagalog of Tayabas, Quezon&nbsp;perform the abaruray, sometimes called <strong>tagayan</strong>, <strong>hapayan</strong>, and <strong>pandanggo sa baso</strong>. Abaruray is a contraction of the words &ldquo;aba&rdquo; and &ldquo;ruray.&rdquo; <em>Aba</em> is &ldquo;hey&rdquo; or &ldquo;hail&rdquo; while <em>Ruray</em> is a nickname for Aurora. In this dance, a woman offers a drink to visitors to signal the beginning of dancing and singing. &ldquo;Kaninong Anak Ito?&rdquo; (Whose Child Is This?) is a song that is popular among children. The children carry a &ldquo;&lsquo;baby,&rdquo; whom they pretend to find lying beside an owl on the grass, and whose mother they look for later. The Tagalog <strong>lerion</strong> is performed in barrio Parang, Marikina&nbsp;to the tune of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/924\">&ldquo;Leron-Leron Sinta&rdquo;</a> (Leron-Leron My Beloved), while <strong>bahay kubo</strong> (nipa hut) is arranged for children who sing about a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\">nipa hut</a> with a garden full of edible plants like eggplants, beans, gourds, and peanuts. <strong>Paruparong bukid</strong> imitates the movements of the butterfly to whom the lady of the song is compared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a>, popular among the Tagalog and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, dancers sing and mime the lyrics to the accompaniment of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/812\">harp</a>, or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>. In the lyrics, the male offers his love to the female who wards off the attention being lavished upon her. If the dancer-singers are good, the balitaw may last several hours. The dancers stop only when one has outsung all the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>palmerito</strong> (&ldquo;small hands&rdquo;) of Janiuay, Iloilo&nbsp;is about a crab. The <strong>inday na kunday</strong> of Leyte is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship dance</a> performed during social gatherings with a song accompaniment. The <strong>gayong-gayong</strong> of Aklan and Capiz tells about a man choking on a piece of adobo and asking for help to dislodge it from his throat. The <strong>pinggan-pinggan pino</strong> of Bohol, sung alternately by a boy and a girl, is a courtship dance in which the boy keeps a small saucer in his pocket as a gift to his loved one. The <strong>lawiswis kawayan</strong>, which describes the sound of bamboo leaves swaying in the wind, was popularized by the people of Samar and Leyte but is also performed in Davao by Visayan settlers. In Marinduque, the <strong>putong</strong> (&ldquo;to crown&rdquo;) is performed in honor of a special guest or a birthday celebrant. The singers sing the first part but dance the crowning portion of the song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Cagayan sing and dance the <strong>pintalatoo cu ta futu cao</strong> (&ldquo;pondering within my heart&rdquo;) to tell about a girl who refuses to accept a returning suitor. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> like to name their song dances after their loved ones. Examples are <strong>manang biday</strong>, <strong>rogelia</strong> in Pangasinan, <strong>sainita</strong> in Nueva Viscaya, and <strong>pastora</strong>, where a boy pleads and kneels before Pastora. In the <strong>basulto</strong> of Pampanga, one verse is usually danced and the next sung. A town inspired the <strong>sa banwa sang Buenavista</strong> of Bohol and Iloilo. It tells of two unmarried sisters from the town of Buenavista. When the youngest gets married, the eldest cries; the younger sister consoles the other with assurances that she will someday find her own husband.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2474\">Larry A.

Spanish influence is strongest in urban or Creole dances, also known as <strong>bailes criollos de Filipinas</strong> or <strong>bailes de cabecera</strong> (big-town dances), less in the <strong>bailes de sementera</strong> (rural folk dances), and least in the <strong>bailes de la monta&ntilde;a</strong> (mountain dances).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduced in the 16th century, Spanish dances became models of local choreographic inspiration among Filipinos. Cleric and lay missionaries, and families of bureaucrats, soldiers, and settler-traders introduced the basic steps, music, and forms of what later became Filipino folk dances.

Early dances were the <strong>sakuting</strong>, <strong>maglalatik</strong>, and <strong>calesa</strong> (later known as <strong>caleseras</strong>). Dances also depicted specific forms of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/80\"><strong>paseo</strong></a>, with the&nbsp;<em>sombrillas&nbsp;</em>(umbrellas),&nbsp;<em>abanicos&nbsp;</em>(fans),&nbsp;<em>bastones&nbsp;</em>(canes),&nbsp;<em>mantillas&nbsp;</em>(veils),&nbsp;<em>mantones de Manila&nbsp;</em>(shawls of Manila), and&nbsp;<em>palillos&nbsp;</em>(bamboo or stick castanets). These later flavored the scenes of love and courtship in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><em>sarsuwela</em></a>, the romantic comedy with songs and dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most famous of the pasakalye (later <strong>paso doble</strong>) genre is the <strong>danza popular espa&ntilde;ola</strong>, in the <strong>paso dobles toreros</strong>, such as <strong>espa&ntilde;a ca&ntilde;i</strong>, <strong>currito de la cruz</strong>, <strong>alma andaluza</strong>, <strong>el relicario</strong>, and <strong>cielo andaluz</strong>. The espa&ntilde;a ca&ntilde;i was and still is the representative Spanish dance. The <strong>chotis madrile&ntilde;o</strong>, complete with manton de Manila and <em>paineta&nbsp;</em>(comb) or <em>pa&ntilde;oleta&nbsp;</em>(shawl), and <em>abanico&nbsp;</em>(fan), became popular at the turn of the century in Manila, Iloilo, Vigan, and Zamboanga. The one-two-three step and beat of the chotis, and its grand-waltz steps gave way to the swagger of the colorful manton or the big abanico. Like the paso doble, the chotis madrile&ntilde;o that came with the <em>traje de chula&nbsp;</em>(which strongly influenced the <em>ponyang traje de mestiza&nbsp;</em>of the early 1900s) came to be loved by Filipinos, and eventually became bilingual, in Spanish and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>/Visayan/<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>. Some examples are &ldquo;El Paypay de Manila&rdquo; and &ldquo;Neneng&rdquo; (a <strong>chotis balitaw</strong>). The most famous Spanish chotis are &ldquo;El Pichi,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Ma&ntilde;uela,&rdquo; &ldquo;Manoletin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Monisima,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mantoncito de Manila,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Rosa de Madrid,&rdquo; &ldquo;Soy de Madrid,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Madrid, Madrid, Madrid&rdquo; by Mexican composer Agustin Lara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Spanish waltz</strong> preceded the chotis and pasakalye (or paso doble). The waltz step is found in almost all Filipino folk dances, and in the common ballroom dances of Filipino fiestas,&nbsp;<em>saraos</em>,&nbsp;<em>te danzantes</em>, and <em>tertulias literario-musicales&nbsp;</em>held by the rich. At the turn of the century, the paso doble was replaced by the <strong>Argentine tango</strong> as the national Filipino ballroom dance. There were variations in Rudolf Valentino movies as well as the Manuel Quezon dance-step impositions. But the jota, <strong>sevillanas antiguas</strong>, <strong>navarras</strong>, and <strong>aragonesas</strong> persisted as <strong>danzas de exhibicion</strong> in fairs,&nbsp;<em>verbenas&nbsp;</em>(night festivals), and carnivals, and in grand mansions up to the early 1970s. The four-part sevillanas reached the Philippines in the 17th century. The sevillanas antiguas became a native Creole dance or <strong>danza criolla</strong> known as <strong>la jota sevillana de Panay</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"video_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the <strong>danzas clasicas de Espa&ntilde;a</strong>, danced to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/38/835\">compositions</a> of Albeniz, De Falla, Granados, Ravel, Bizet, Tchaikovsky, and Mozart are based on the sevillanas. They have almost all the feet positions and figures of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a>, and may be group, solo, trio, or couple dances. They usually depict a particular era of Spanish art and dress, like that of the <em>la epoca goyesca&nbsp;</em>from the styles of Francisco Goya, or <em>de la era isabelina&nbsp;</em>from the times of Queen Isabella II de Bourbon and Kings Alfonso XII and XIII.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonia Merce (aka La Argentina) was a great Spanish dancer of the 1920s and 1930s. She came to Manila to perform at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> (then known as Teatro Cervantes) and introduced the <strong>danza clasica espa&ntilde;ola</strong>. Her vast repertoire of Spanish folk, classic, and popular dances included Filipino dances such as the <strong>cari&ntilde;osa</strong>, <strong>binasuan</strong>, and the local <strong>pandanggo</strong>. Merce was the first to introduce Filipino dance, then considered part of the Spanish and Latin American dance repertoire, to the outside world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She met Rosa G. Jimenez Rivera of Iloilo, with whom she exchanged dances. Jimenez Rivera was born in the late 1880s in Iloilo, a child of Spanish parents from Seville, where she was known as &ldquo;La Filipina.&rdquo; As a child, she lived in Spain where she went on to become a professional Spanish dancer and teacher. Most information on Spanish dance in the Philippines at the turn of the century comes from her. Jimenez Rivera also danced native dances such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><strong>singkil</strong></a> and other Muslim dances, passing them on to Merce. She also performed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> dances, and used the Spanish <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/83\"><strong>zapateado</strong></a> to measure the primitive steps and movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Merce&rsquo;s visit, Spanish dance enjoyed a brilliant resurgence in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2576\">Manolo Rosado</a>, Manila&rsquo;s great Spanish dancer, and several Filipinos who became local exponents of the dance, until the outbreak of World War II. Rosado danced from 1953 to 1955 with the Spanish Ballet of Marinela de Montijo in Europe, and in 1956 with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">company</a> of Magda Briones in Mexico. He also danced in Vienna with the company of Kapps and Johannes. In the 1950s, Angelita Blanco and Juanita Garcia performed with Federico Elizalde&rsquo;s Manila Little Symphony. Before World War II, Jose Zarah of Portugal came to Manila with a Spanish troupe, stayed behind to perform at Palace Theater with Bebe Marcaida and became an impresario-producer of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><em>bodabil</em></a> and stage shows at Clover Theater into the 1960s. After the war, the <strong>danza espa&ntilde;ola</strong> became popular in Iloilo and Bacolod, as the daughters of sugar hacienda owners were sent to Spain to study. Of these, Anita Arregui, Baby Feria Gomez, and Maria Vicente Gamboa (aka Baby Bonin) opened <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/30\">schools</a> in Bacolod.

		"text": "<p><strong>Street dance</strong> is dancing executed by groups of performers as part of a religious procession or a secular parade, which courses through the streets of a town or city. Using the thoroughfare as a social spatial stream, participants of communal celebrations create group movements usually in unison and to the music of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">brass band</a> or other groups, while onlookers watch on both sides of the road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Philippine history, street dancing was a form of prayer, often in fulfilment of personal vows, performed as part of the daytime procession held on the feast of the town&rsquo;s patron saint. The latter&rsquo;s image was carried on <em>andas&nbsp;</em>or rode on an elaborately decorated float, followed by a brass band playing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/787\">pandanggo</a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\">balitaw</a> music. To this lively beat, devotees, usually women, danced together, forming two parallel lines in front of the patron&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>karo</em>. In Pakil, Laguna, the&nbsp;<em>andas&nbsp;</em>of the Birhen ng Turumba literally sways as the men carrying it dance to the refrain &ldquo;Maria, Maria, Mariangga / Magsayaw tayo at magsaya / Sumayaw ng tuturumba / para sa Birheng Maria&rdquo; (&ldquo;Mary, Mary, sweet Mary / Let us dance and celebrate / And dance the turumba / For the Virgin Mary&rdquo;). The procession begins from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>, winds through the principal streets of the town which are decorated with buntings and arches, and ends up in the church after several hours. Devotees from Laguna and nearby provinces join the procession, asking the Virgin for personal favors or thanking her for favors granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Far more elaborate is the street dancing in Angono, Rizal, specially prepared for the feast of the town&rsquo;s patron saint, San Clemente. On Nov 23, the townspeople mount a procession that winds through Angono&rsquo;s streets. Various contingents&mdash;students from local <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a> in <em>balintawak&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costumes</a>, organizations of fishermen, farmers, vendors in their trade attires, civic, religious, and government groups in their gala uniforms, among others&mdash;dance or play to the same beat, creating an overwhelming sound with their&nbsp;<em>bakya&nbsp;</em>(wooden clogs) and instruments. The procession also highlights families of dancing&nbsp;<em>higantes&nbsp;</em>(giants): huge figures of bamboo with heads which are dressed in male and female native attire. One person carries and manipulates the figure from the inside, so that it can sway, bow, jump, jog, and dance to any tune.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Obando, Bulacan, devotees flock to join the procession in honor of the three patron saints&mdash;the Virgin of Salambao, Santa Clara, and San Pascual Bailon. In an orderly sequence, groups of women, sporting different colors of baro&rsquo;t saya or <em>terno</em>, dance to the pandanggo melodies played by the brass band, brandishing anahaw fans or handkerchiefs. Joining them are devotees in civilian clothes who converge in Obando to dance and pray for a husband, a wife, or a child. After several hours, the procession returns to the church or the church patio, where devotees as one engage in almost an hour of frenetic dancing before the altar and the images of the three saints, reminiscent of the fevered dancing of <em>babaylanes&nbsp;</em>(native shamans) in a trance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In many towns whose patron saint is Santiago Matamoros, a special street dance is performed to honor the saint. Sometimes called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/458\"><strong>moros y cristianos</strong></a>, this dance dramatizes the conflict between the Christians and the Moors, with the Christians winning in the end, usually with the help of the patron saint. A version called <strong>kinabayo</strong> may be found in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Sur, which is also held in honor of Santiago Matamoros. A modest version called <strong>sayaw</strong> is performed on the streets of Ibajay, Aklan, but in honor of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>Ati-Atihan</strong> in Kalibo, Aklan, which is held in honor of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o or Holy Child Jesus, is one of the oldest fiestas where street dancing is the main event, with participants stepping <strong>sad-sad</strong> style, a style attributed to the ancestral <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\"><strong>ati</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">aeta</a>) of the Visayas, after whom the festival is named. To emulate the Ati and as part of a sacrifice, participants in the Ati-Atihan are required to rub soot on their faces, hands, torsos, and legs. Today, groups join the parade in groups, sporting fantastic costumes and performing their own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreographies</a> to a beat that has become popular all over the country. Prizes are given out to the outstanding performers and costumes. At the same time the portrayal is allied to the supposed migration of the ten Bornean datus to the island of Panay and their acquisition of lands through barter with the aboriginal ati, after whom the feast is named.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cebu, the <strong>sinulog</strong> also venerates the Santo Ni&ntilde;o and the conversion to Christianity in its street dancing. The image of the Holy Child in the basilica is supposed to have been the one brought by the Spanish fleet of Ferdinand Magellan in 1521. Not too long ago, this street dance imitated the indigenous Aeta, so that participants even painted themselves black. At present, this is no longer allowed by the organizers so that the dramatization of the Aeta and their shaman has now become subsidiary or been dispensed with. Now the official competitive dancing in the streets culminates in a contest among contingents in Cebu&rsquo;s Sports Complex. Due to the national prominence of the sinulog, this kind of ending (and judging) has been observed by other places in Cebu Province in their versions of street dancing. Today many cities and provinces, including those in the Visayas and Mindanao, also compete in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dinagyang</strong> in Iloilo is influenced by both Cebu and Aklan. It began when Cebu gave an image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o to Iloilo City, thus also honoring the saint. Like in Aklan, the Dinagyang festival integrates the story of the barter in Panay between the native ati and the Bornean datu. But unlike in Cebu, the cast of Ati dominates in elaborate costuming and choreography but there is no culminative showdown on one <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">stage</a>, inasmuch as viewing and judging happen in various streets of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same prominence of indigenous people prevail in the <strong>Pintados</strong>, now renamed <strong>Kasadyaan</strong>, in Tacloban, Leyte. Also centering around the worship of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, this fairly new street dance celebration derives its main identity from the historical practice of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2118\">tattooing</a> among the Visayans, a process mistaken as body-painting by the Spaniards. It has also spawned various modes of representing Leyte. Versions of the pintados have also won prizes in the sinulog competition in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent decades, street dancing has also been featured in festivals which are secular in nature, organized for one or more of the following reasons: to promote the main economic product of a place, to instill pride of place and regional identity, to underscore tribal unity and identity, and even to promote corporate interests. These festivals are usually characterized by elaborate costumes, movements that may use or reinterpret the traditional dances, and fierce competition among participants. Many have become the focus of local and even national tourism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1996, the Baguio Flower Festival, also known as the Panagbenga (a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a> term meaning &ldquo;season of blossoming&rdquo;) has been attracting tourists to its February events, which does not only highlight Baguio&rsquo;s flower industry and Cordillera culture but also advocates respect for and protection of the environment. The festival includes a street display of artworks inspired by flowers, local and national landscaping competitions, open-air markets selling Baguio&rsquo;s flowers, boating competitions, horse-riding activities, flea markets, and flower-related school activities. But the climax of the festival is the parade, in which local dance groups wear fantastic outfits depicting flowers, bees, and birds, as well as traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a> costumes or modern interpretations thereof. Invariably, Ibaloy-themed groups showcase dances that feature <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gangsa</a>&nbsp;</em>music among the boys and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/39\"><strong>banga</strong></a> or <strong>pot dance</strong> among the girls. Big floats, funded by civic and business groups, schools, and government agencies, depict lush gardens or native houses or topiaries representing huge swans or bees, all covered in fresh Baguio flowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another new and invented street dance is the <strong>Masskara</strong> in Bacolod. The festival was supposed to have been created to comfort the people of Negros Occidental after the fall of their sugar industry. This has grown to be an elaborate and colorful street dancing event, characterized by the donning of various styles of masks. Unlike the masks or make-up in ati-atihan and dinagyang, these are not always meant to represent the aeta. There is a lot of inventiveness in designing these masks, including those sold to the bystanders as souvenirs. Participants move to the rhythm of Latin beats. The basic theme is merry-making of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An interesting adaptation and transformation of the sinulog style is found in Camiguin Island. To highlight its agricultural produce, Camiguin stages a Lanzones Festival. It parallels Cebu&rsquo;s dual formats, namely, the street dancing, and later, the showdown which also adopts Cebu&rsquo;s triptych staging style: a central group is framed by two at the sides that all converge at the end. But where the Santo Ni&ntilde;o is central in Cebu, in Camiguin it is the branch of the <em>lanzones</em> that is waved by dancers during the parade. The lanzones are threatened by people in bat costumes, which are equivalent to the unconverted masses in the Cebu sinulog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the south, Tawi-Tawi Island stages the <strong>Agal-Agal Festival</strong> every year to commemorate its founding as a province separate from Sulu. The main event of the festival is the street dancing which aims to conserve and promote the cultural heritage of the peoples of Tawi-Tawi, especially through its dance and music. The special focus of these efforts are the dances unique to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Badjao</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2354\">Jama Mapun</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, namely, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong>/<strong>igal</strong></a>, the <strong>kuntaw</strong>, and the <strong>linggisan</strong>. Floats, which are assembled on motor vehicles, represent the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/228\"><em>lepa</em></a> and other types of boats in the Tawi-Tawi area. While the aims of the festival are commendable and participation in the festival among the youth has been enthusiastic, the dancing has tended to mimic the ati-atihan in terms of musical rhythm and movements, even as the costumes tend to adopt cuts and colors that are not representative of the groups of Tawi-Tawi. Upon the advice of pangalay/igal scholar and performer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a>, festival organizers are seeking to counter this tendency, in order to project what is truly unique to Tawi-Tawi in terms of dance, music, and costumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proceeding from Manila&rsquo;s Luneta Park to Pasay City, the Aliwan street dancing competition sponsored by a broadcasting company has aspired to be national. It draws noted winners in sinulog, dinagyang, and many other festivals from the north and south of the country, from provinces with Christian, Muslim, and lumad (indigenous folk) population. It has added categories for floats and beauty contests, which are given the biggest prizes. Whereas entertainment personalities and national politicians&rsquo; presence are highlighted in Cebu, in Pasay the proceedings during Aliwan are further sustained by interspersed live and broadcasted segments during entrances of contingents.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2621\">Basilio Esteban S.

It parallels Cebu&#x2019;s dual formats, namely, the street dancing, and later, the showdown which also adopts Cebu&#x2019;s triptych staging style: a central group is framed by two at the sides that all converge at the end. But where the Santo Ni&#xF1;o is central in Cebu, in Camiguin it is the branch of the <em>lanzones</em> that is waved by dancers during the parade. The lanzones are threatened by people in bat costumes, which are equivalent to the unconverted masses in the Cebu sinulog."

The main event of the festival is the street dancing which aims to conserve and promote the cultural heritage of the peoples of Tawi-Tawi, especially through its dance and music. The special focus of these efforts are the dances unique to the <a href=\"/1/2/2371\">Sama Badjao</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2354\">Jama Mapun</a>, and the <a href=\"/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, namely, the <a href=\"/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong>/<strong>igal</strong></a>, the <strong>kuntaw</strong>, and the <strong>linggisan</strong>. Floats, which are assembled on motor vehicles, represent the <a href=\"/2/5/228\"><em>lepa</em></a> and other types of boats in the Tawi-Tawi area. While the aims of the festival are commendable and participation in the festival among the youth has been enthusiastic, the dancing has tended to mimic the ati-atihan in terms of musical rhythm and movements, even as the costumes tend to adopt cuts and colors that are not representative of the groups of Tawi-Tawi. Upon the advice of pangalay/igal scholar and performer <a href=\"/6/51/2397\">Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa</a>, festival organizers are seeking to counter this tendency, in order to project what is truly unique to Tawi-Tawi in terms of dance, music, and costumes."

It has added categories for floats and beauty contests, which are given the biggest prizes.

		"text": "<div id=\"video_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Subli</strong> is a religious devotional practice which involves dance, song, prayer, instrumental music, and feasting. It is performed in honor of the Mahal na Poong Santa Cruz, a large cross of <em>anubing</em> wood with the face of the silver sun at its center. The icon was allegedly discovered in the early decades of Spanish rule in what is now the town of Alitagtag, Batangas. It has since been honored as the patron of many towns in the area, notably the ancient town of Bauan, Batangas. The performance of this devotion usually happens around the first week of May, in celebration of the feast day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, whose feast day falls on May 3. In towns tracing their origins to Bauan, such as Alitagtag, Santa Teresita, San Pascual, and Agoncillo, the subli consists of a long sequence of performances and entertainment in varied forms and styles called <em>laro</em> by its practitioners. The practice fulfills the function of the <em>panata</em> which, in many Philippine communities, is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> transaction between individuals or groups in a community seeking favor from a deity in exchange for lifelong devotion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subli verses recount the first journey of the early <strong>manunubli</strong> (subli performers) through the fields, hills, and rivers of Batangas in search of the miraculous cross and their forging of a panata with the icon. Sections of verse are sung to a fixed <em>punto</em> or skeletal melody, which may be elaborated on in different ways by different subli troupes. About five of these punto are used in a complete subli performance. These sections may be divided further into various fixed dance patterns involving one, two or eight pairs of men and women. These numbers seem to be the norm in Bauan, although other towns like Agoncillo may have formations involving three pairs at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The stances, gestures, and movements of the male dancers are freewheeling and dramatic, consisting of leaping, striking the ground with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/806\"><em>kalaste</em></a> (wooden bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/806\">clappers</a> held in both hands), and other movements suggesting the martial arts. The women circle on half-toe, performing the <strong>talik</strong> (small refined gestures with wrists and fingers), their fingers superficially touching or appearing to touch their small-brimmed hats and <em>alampay</em> (triangular scarf worn loosely over the shoulder) which are the essential parts of their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume</a>.

In the different barangay associated with Batangas City, the subli dance is also performed but it is a less elaborate affair, without the intricacies of the practice of Bauan. It is usually appended to the Maytime Alay or Santacruzan celebrations and is not associated with the panata. As a result, the songs and prayers are not found in Batangas City practice and the performances are more playful and associated with courtship and other more secular and even erotic concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1988, in celebration of Batangas City Foundation Day, the Cultural Affairs Board of Batangas City launched an annual Sublian Festival that has survived until today. School and community groups from the city and its surrounding towns were encouraged to learn the dances, songs, and prayers from the traditional manunubli and perform 10-minute excerpts in competition. This has led to a revival of interest in the devotion and the training of another generation of subli practitioners.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4146\">Elena Rivera Mirano</a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2531\"><strong>Manunubli ng Sinala</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Retana, Wenceslao. 1888.<em>El Indio Batangue&ntilde;o: Estudio Etnografico</em>.3rd ed.

This dance is also known as <strong>salukisik</strong> as the main musical instrument used for it is the <em>salukisit</em>, a hand-held bronze <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a> that is upturned then hit with a stick. It is played together with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a> to produce a fast, syncopated beat in 2/4 measure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, the male dancer wears only a headgear and a <em>baal</em> or loincloth for this dance. The female dancer, on the other hand, pairs a <em>kimona</em> or upper garment with a <em>kain</em>, a wrap-around skirt, usually cream-colored and accentuated with violet and maroon prints. Both dancers accessorize with <em>batek</em> or bracelets all made of beads of varying hues.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Each dancer holds an <em>allap</em>, a piece of cloth the size of a kain. A kain could also be used as an allap.

		"text": "<p><strong>Tap dance</strong> is an entertainment dance where the dancers tap with their toes and heels. When done with metal cleats, it plays up the tapping sound; when danced without, it shuffles with the soft-shoe. In Germany, it is called the <strong>steptanz</strong>, the name by which it was known in the United States in the early days, until it became popular as the tap dance in the 1930s. Tap dancing is most often associated with African-Americans. It is said that the &ldquo;parent of tap dancing,&rdquo; Thomas Darmouth Rice, imitated an African-American man who improvised a song and antic, which Rice incorporated into his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/46\">vaudeville act</a>. Zip Coon (said to be Bob Farrel originally), a contemporary of Rice, danced the <strong>leeve</strong>, as the style was also called. George Washington Dixon wrote &ldquo;Old Zip Coon&rdquo; which became &ldquo;Turkey in the Straw.&rdquo; As a <strong>clog</strong>, the tap dance was done to 6/8 rhythm like a &ldquo;quick waltz in half time;&rdquo; as a leeve, it was done to 2/4 or 4/4, a march time that later became the fox-trot tempo. Many minstrel troupes and individuals popularized the style invented by the Blackfaces, the greatest of whom was the legendary Bill Robinson or Bojangles. His movies with Shirley Temple made him world famous. Paul Draper is a recent classicist who danced to Bach or Couperin, and composed a choreographed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\">sonata</a> all to his own tapping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although tap dance in the Philippines became popular mainly through the movies of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, it was performed much earlier by minstrel troupes around the turn of the century. In the 1930s, the brothers Richard and Raymond Reynolds made a team and also taught their fellow Filipino vaudeville entertainers. Buster and the Garcia sisters, Flor and Modesta, formed a trio of tap and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\">jazz</a> dancers. Charito &ldquo;Chuchi&rdquo; Hernandez had a Spanish-American tap and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a> teacher named Carmen Macleod.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaudeville and stage shows grew with the movies and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\">movie musicals</a> showed fine examples of tap dancing by Eleanor Powell who was billed as &ldquo;the world&rsquo;s greatest tap dancer,&rdquo; Joan Crawford, Rita Hayworth, Anne Miller, Ray Bolger, Sammy Davis Jr, and the occasional or long-time teams: Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney, Vera Ellen and Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds and Donald O&rsquo;Connor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locally, Nieves Manuel and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a>, known as the &ldquo;Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire of the Philippines,&rdquo; teamed up.

Tap dance was formally taught by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2424\">Roberta Cassell</a> in the late 1940s. Among her students were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2529\">Carlyn Manning</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2419\">Rose Borromeo</a>, who became serious teachers of the popular art. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2418\">Julie Borromeo</a> learned it mainly from her sister Rose Borromeo who also taught Bing Locsin, whose sister, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\">Agnes</a>, also became a noted tap dance teacher and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\">modern dance</a> choreographer. Agnes Locsin has used Filipino ethnic music and themes to interpret the tap technique.

		"text": "<p><strong>Tinikling</strong> is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic dance</a> that originated in the province of Leyte but is also common to other Visayan provinces. The name itself comes from the word &ldquo;tikling,&rdquo; which is a local name for the barred rail (<em>Gallirallus torquatus</em>), a long-legged bird with extended neck. The dance mimics the playful movements of the <em>tikling</em> as they forage in rice fields, where they avoid bamboo traps placed by farmers to protect the crops. To simulate the tikling&rsquo;s plight, the barefoot tinikling dancers hop in and out of bamboo poles that clap together to a rhythm. The tinikling requires stamina, agility, and musicality to be able to keep up with the beat of the dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tinikling is the most famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> of the Philippines. It is actually considered by many the national dance of the Philippines. Because the tinikling is a great crowd pleaser, it has been made the mandatory final&eacute; of most dance groups over the decades: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan</a>, the Far Eastern University Folk Dance Troupe, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2555\">Baranggay Folk Dance Troupe</a> in the 1950s and 1960s; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</a> in the 1970s; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2502\">Kaloob Philippine Music and Dance Ministry</a> in the 2000s. From the basic number of four performers, folk dance groups have expanded the number of dancers to 20, or more. But the transformation of tinikling must be attributed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a>, later proclaimed National Artist for dance, who turned tinikling into a dazzling show stopper by speeding up the pace of the dancing to suit the taste of a Western <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/24\">audience</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance has two versions. The more famous one utilizes twin bamboo poles about nine feet long which are clapped apart in two counts and slid close together on the third count. The less popular and older version, called <strong>tinikling ha bayo</strong>, is more difficult because it uses two rice pestles about six feet long. Tinikling ha bayo is a recreational dance performed during the harvesting of rice. While resting after a rigorous session of pounding rice, harvesters take time to play the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, sing, and dance. Music is in 3/4 time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">Costumes</a> consist of the <em>patadyong</em> (skirt), <em>kimona</em> (blouse), and <em>panyo</em> (scarf draped on a shoulder) for the women; and barong tagalog and a pair of red pants with one leg rolled below the knee for the men. Two persons position themselves opposite each other to hold the tips of the twin pestles. They strike the pestles over a wooden board to produce two major rhythms. A male and a female waltz their way to positions opposite the pestles and they tap their right foot in between the pestles on designated beats of each measure with three counts. This introduction is followed by seven figures with varying degrees of difficulty using leap and step, heel and toe, knee dip, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/65\"><strong>kuradang</strong></a> (an interim syncopated waltz step with arms in fourth position done outside the poles), and tinikling step.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic tinikling step is executed with a leap on left foot outside pestles, followed by a leap on right foot between pestles, then a leap on left foot in between. Then the dancer leaps on right foot outside clapping pestles, succeeded by left skip in between, and jump on same foot to turn about. The female dancer holds the patadyong with her left hand and raises the right arm in reverse-T position with a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong>kumintang</strong></a> (circular or wavelike hand movements from the wrist). The male dancer puts his hands on his waist. Meanwhile, the knee dip is a challenging movement that consists of standing outside the pestles, then bending the supporting leg as the other leg dips the knee to touch the floor in between pestles. The kuradang portion of tinikling ha bayo is executed outside the pestles, which consists of footwork and arm movements with kumintang flourish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The popular version of tinikling that uses bamboo poles has eight figures consisting of 16 measures each. Dancers are positioned at the left side of the bamboo, with the dancer&rsquo;s right shoulder near the poles. The tinikling&rsquo;s basic step starts with a hop right inside the poles, followed by a hop left inside, then a hop right outside the poles. The repetition is reversed and the sequence is enhanced with arm movements with kumintang hand gestures. Half-turns are also executed while in between the poles. Then there is the whole figure with heel and toe combinations in between clapping bamboo poles. To animate the dancing, there is a crossover sequence done by hopping with the right foot in between the poles and then crossing the left foot over right ending with a hop outside the poles. This is followed by a kuradang portion wherein the couple dances outside bamboo poles. Then, the pair resumes dancing through the poles with the hopscotch figure, which consists of jumping inside the poles twice on both feet and hopping out each foot on both sides of the poles. Partners may hold hands as they dance the hopscotch figure. The next figure consists of variations on the crossover figure by changing the partners&rsquo; orientations and directions, and by adding half-turns. The dance ends with the basic steps, and then a bow with a pose.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie S.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>tongatong</strong>, sometimes called <strong>chonggachong</strong>, is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/91\">ritual dance</a> of the Baliwon tribe of Paracelis, Mountain Province. It is usually performed at the beginning of a wedding feast, with the bride and the groom beginning the dance, later on followed by their guests. It could also be danced during other important occasions, with at least six male and two female dancers involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike most Cordillera dances that rely on bronze <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\"><em>gangsa</em></a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a> for music, this dance makes use of the <em>tongatong</em>, which are bamboo tubes of varying lengths and pitches. The longer the bamboo, the lower the pitch it makes when one of its ends is pounded on the ground. The rhythm produced by the combination of bamboo tubes is still syncopated, which is characteristic of all Cordillera dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movements of the tongatong are reminiscent of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship dances</a> of Abra and Kalinga. The groom or male dancer zigzags towards his bride or female partner, using a step-hop move, and with his torso bent, he waves the <em>allap</em>, a piece of unsewn cloth, in front of him to attract his partner&rsquo;s attention. The bride feigns indifference at his romantic attempts. Dressed in a <em>lumfon</em> (also <em>lomfon</em>), which is a blouse, and a <em>tapis</em> (also <em>kain</em>) or colored woven wrap-around skirt, she keeps her hands on her hips, and proudly goes the opposite direction using a step-hop step. Undaunted, the groom, dressed only in <em>be-er&nbsp;</em>(also <em>ba-ar</em>) or loincloth and a <em>gongon</em> or beaded necklace, runs after her. He dances around her, hopping or springing about following the fast tempo of the tongatong and offers his allap every chance he gets. She continues to dance, too, either with her hands on her hips or with arms stretched sideways, fingers pointing upward. At one point, she deliberately moves towards him, only to have him chase after her the next. This happens a few times&mdash;a series of flirtatious moves on her part. Eventually she relents and accepts the allap, the symbol of his affection and his ability to protect her. She places the cloth over both their shoulders, and then they exit together.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Sarah Lumba</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p id=\"\"><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/45/2\">Indigenous Traditions and Transformations in Philippine Dance</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p id=\"\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\"><strong>Ritual</strong></a> Dancing</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Taguba, Remedios, and Carmen T.

Dressed in a <em>lumfon</em> (also <em>lomfon</em>), which is a blouse, and a <em>tapis</em> (also <em>kain</em>) or colored woven wrap-around skirt, she keeps her hands on her hips, and proudly goes the opposite direction using a step-hop step. Undaunted, the groom, dressed only in <em>be-er&#xA0;</em>(also <em>ba-ar</em>) or loincloth and a <em>gongon</em> or beaded necklace, runs after her. He dances around her, hopping or springing about following the fast tempo of the tongatong and offers his allap every chance he gets. She continues to dance, too, either with her hands on her hips or with arms stretched sideways, fingers pointing upward. At one point, she deliberately moves towards him, only to have him chase after her the next. This happens a few times&#x2014;a series of flirtatious moves on her part. Eventually she relents and accepts the allap, the symbol of his affection and his ability to protect her. She places the cloth over both their shoulders, and then they exit together.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span></strong>"

		"text": "<p><strong>Tumahik</strong>, which literally translates to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">war dance</a>&rdquo; in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> bahasa, is a male <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/70\">martial dance</a> of the Yakan ethnic group originating from Basilan province. The province of Basilan, founded in 1974, is the largest and northernmost island of the Sulu Archipelago located just across the southern shoreline of Zamboanga Peninsula. One of the municipalities of Basilan Province is Lamitan, the original home of the Yakan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumahik dance steps and movement patterns are reflective of the Yakans&rsquo; love for horses. Traditionally, owning a number of horses was a sign of wealth and status. Each Yakan family owned a horse as animal of labor and means of transportation. In a tumahik performance, as the legs of a dancer move, the <em>jambu</em> (tassels) of the leggings swing to and fro like the horse&rsquo;s tail. The men display intricate footwork likened to the frenetic movements of enraged horses: trotting, galloping, kicking, jumping, skipping, or limping when hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally, tumahik was performed during combat to settle disputes or to defend themselves from invading groups. While going through the motions of the dance, the warriors would stick out their tongue and spit. They made grotesque facial expressions: gritting their teeth and sneering, sending dagger looks, and making their cheeks quiver to infuriate opponents. The more aggressive performance won over the more subdued one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, the Yakan considered the tumahik as the only acceptable dance form in the community, as the women, especially those coming from very conservative families, were not allowed to be seen in public, or to be in the presence of men. The dance also became an important training and rite of passage for Yakan boys five years old and above. The father, as the principal trainer, guides his son/s by familiarizing them with the most important items, like the <em>budjak</em> (spear) and the <em>taming</em> (shield). He teaches the boys how to use the spear with the correct stance, footwork, and facial expressions. He also demonstrates how to wear the traditional attire and accessories that go with the war dance. As the trainees mature, the martial training becomes more rigid with the objective of transforming them into fearless warriors. The young men acquire precise and strong techniques in the movement of the hands, wrists, arms, body, legs, and feet. These are essential to enable the young fighters to deftly wield the spear and the shield in assault and defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumahik is revered by the elders of the community. The dance plays a significant role during a wedding ceremony or <em>pegkawin</em>. The tumahik performance during a wedding ceremony has a three-fold purpose: first, to ward off evil spirits that might disturb the three-day ceremony; second, to serve as a rite of passage for the young man to enter adulthood; and third, to prepare the groom for greater responsibilities like earning a living for his family and protecting his wife and children from harm and danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the pegkawin or wedding ceremony, the groom&rsquo;s relatives, who are also tumahik dancers, accompany him to the bride&rsquo;s house. The <em>pangantin lella</em> (groom) performs the tumahik while his relatives and the imam approach the bride&rsquo;s house where the wedding ceremony is set. Holding the spear with his right hand and shield with his left, the groom thrusts the spear in the ground in front of the house while the parents and relatives of the <em>pangantin dende</em> (bride) wait at the <em>pantan</em> (porch). The ceremony cannot proceed unless the groom dances the tumahik. As soon as the groom finishes the dance, <em>tagungguh</em> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a> ensemble) musicians play the <em>megtambul</em> (tumahik beat) and expert tumahik dancers take turns to show-off their abilities. A <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pamansak</strong></a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\"><strong>pangalay</strong></a> dancer accompanies the performance. The groom and his entourage are allowed to approach the stairs of the house after the dance performances. A relative sings the <em>sa-il</em>, a Yakan song, and the group enters the house with a warm reception from the bride&rsquo;s family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fundamental dance steps of the tumahik are grounded on the basic dance position or stance called <strong>ningkas</strong>. The dancer stands with his left foot in front, toe touching the ground, knees turned-in, and the right foot bearing weight of the body. He holds the spear with his right above the head and the left hand clutches the shield covering his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are six basic foot movements: <strong>magkahig</strong> is the motion of scratching the floor by touching the floor with the left or right toe, then brushing the toe backwards. <strong>Magpasu</strong> simulates the trotting of horses, with turned-out feet that are apart with bent knees, then heels are raised and move to any direction. When they hit the ground, the balls of the feet produce a stamping sound like the hoofs of horses. <strong>Netek</strong> is a movement that kicks backwards from the magkahig, in which the dancer brushes his right or left toe backwards, hitting his ankle against his thigh or butt, with the heel of the left or right foot raised. <strong>Patugpah</strong> or skipping movement is done with the dancer hopping continuously forward or to any direction alternately with right and left foot. <strong>Patindak</strong> is a movement characterized by forward kicks. The dancer kicks the opponent&rsquo;s knee with his left or right foot. He pushes the leg of the opponent down with the arch of his foot. <strong>Palaksu</strong> or jumping is done with the dancer standing in fourth position, either left or right foot in front. He springs forward with one or both feet, either with both knees bent on air or with one leg kicking forward or from the side. He then lands in the same or different position with another stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumahik arm movements are less elaborate. The right hand holding the spear may do the movement called <strong>kinaagen</strong> (shaking the spear) or <strong>mag-bono&rsquo; kuntara</strong> (striking the spear). The left hand clutching the shield must maintain the postures of <strong>maglekkeb baranin</strong> (covering the body) or <strong>migpid tammingin</strong> (shaking of the shield).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three basic head movements are <strong>magkeleng-keleng</strong> or shaking the head from side to side; the <strong>maglengek-lengek</strong> or dangling the head from side to side; and the <strong>magpapatey-patey</strong> or <strong>kuweh matey</strong> described as hanging the head at one side, the eyes devoid of expression. The facial expressions throughout the dance are calculated to provoke or to antagonize the opponent. <strong>Magkuti-kuti</strong> means to tease or invite the enemy to attack, moving the head downwards and eyes looking fierce. <strong>Magtige-et</strong> is to grit the teeth. <strong>Magkisi</strong> means to grin. <strong>Magbingis mata</strong> is to look fierce. <strong>Ngusah</strong> means to move the cheeks. <strong>Maglurah</strong> is to spit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tumahik dancers wear the <em>badju</em> (top) and <em>sawwal</em> (trousers) which are entirely made of hand woven <em>sinelu&rsquo;an</em> or of purchased material. The Yakan of Lamitan town proper used to wear garments made from a black cloth called <em>naynay</em>. Traditionally, these shirts and trousers are tight at the sleeves and leggings. Traditional Yakan trousers or sawwal are tight-fitting from the knee down while the section from the thigh going up hangs loose, sewn at the waist with a band of cloth that firmly holds the pants in place when folded. It has a knee-joinery line called <em>bakiyaq</em>, an embroidery of tiny chain stitches of four to six color bands. A <em>sapid</em> or braid, made of intertwined threads, is stitched at the section where the woven cloth is sewn together and around the part of the leggings that reaches the ankle. A sawwal will not be complete without leg tassels made of silk threads called <em>jambu</em> to symbolize their favorite animal, the horse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The badju is a tight-fitting top with tight-fitting sleeves and decorated with gold buttons called <em>batawi</em>. The size and the number of batawi on a shirt determine the prominence of the wearer. The badju also serves as an overcoat or jacket and is elaborately decorated on weddings, graduations, or the grand feast of Lami-lamihan. The men don the <em>pis</em> or head cloth, with a red background symbolizing bravery and strength, coupled with green, yellow, and black patterns. Aside from serving as head protection from heat and during combat, the pis serves as blanket or mat at night or in transit. When used as head cloth, it is folded into a triangle, with the apex on the forehead and the two ends knotted at the nape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Men also wear the <em>kandit</em> or traditional belt which measures up to 15 m or more made of red cotton cloth called <em>gilim</em>. This is tediously coiled around the waist with tassels of unwoven sine&rsquo;luan cloth sewn at one end to cover the genital area. The belt is worn for protection during combat. Sometimes the kandit may be used as a hammock or as a pillow. The Yakan accessorize their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">costume</a> with <em>sappa</em> or <em>lutuan</em> which is a betel nut container tied around the waist; the <em>barung lella</em> or male bolo; and the <em>saruk</em> or nito hat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Megtambul <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/31\">music</a> is the accompaniment for any tumahik performance. The music is produced by the tagungguh composed of three gongs of different sizes, the set of <em>kwintangan tumbaga</em> (graduated bronze gongs), and the <em>gandang</em> (split bamboo tube).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tumahik is an important tradition reflective of the ancient culture of the Yakan. In 2013, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao and Basilan Province launched the first Tumahik Festival. Though the dance is synonymous with war and fighting, the tumahik is also a symbol of the husband&rsquo;s responsibility to protect his wife and family. The latter is the relevant cultural value being propagated by the Tumahik Festival. In the light of the continuing strife in Basilan Province, the Tumahik Festival, erstwhile a symbol of war, is now used as a symbol of protection. Each participating group wears their typical Yakan attire, especially the men, who bring with them their weapons, shields, betel chewing containers, and other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">properties</a>. The festival provides an important venue for the Yakan to hone and exhibit their dancing prowess accompanied by the skillful playing of the traditional tagungguh. The Tumahik Festival promises to uphold Yakan cultural identity.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Earl Francis C.

The decade of <strong>ballroom dancing</strong> in the 1940s gave way to the rock and roll era of the 1950s which also ushered in the beginning of dancing in TV variety shows. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1476\"><em><strong>The Nida-Nestor Show</strong></em></a>, 1964-72, popularized the <strong>cha-cha</strong> and the <strong>boogie</strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/26\">choreographed</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2418\">Julie Borromeo</a>.

Helen Gamboa, the original &ldquo;Dancing Queen&rdquo; became popular in both films and TV with her signature song and dance <em><strong>Bang-Shang-A-Lang</strong></em>. She starred in her own show <em><strong>Helen</strong></em>, 1966-70, and was later dubbed as the diva of the 1960s. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the trend among dancers and TV and movie stars in shows such as <em><strong>Dance-O-Rama</strong></em>, 1967-72, was dancing &ldquo;ad lib&rdquo; or &ldquo;maskipaps&rdquo; (a shortened version of the Filipino phrase &ldquo;Maski papaano,&rdquo; which translates to &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo;), picking up steps from signature dances such as <strong>the chicken</strong>, <strong>mashed potatoes</strong>, <strong>the shovel</strong>, and <strong>watusi</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1970s, dances like <strong>the hustle</strong>, <strong>the bus stop</strong>, <strong>the bump</strong>, <strong>the L.A. walk</strong>, <strong>the grind</strong>, <strong>funk</strong>, <strong>pop</strong> from the record label Motown and their accompanying flashing disco lights bedazzled TV <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/65/1376\">viewers</a> with several dancers and choreographers leaving their mark on local television. Early in the scene were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2563\">Al Quinn</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2421\">Lito Calzado</a>, and Chito Feliciano who started the dance craze even before the dance instructors in <em><strong>Dance Time with Chito</strong></em> (1962-72) caught the public&rsquo;s interest in dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Successful TV dancers all had signature steps that were appealing to televiewers: Mike Monserat and Poncy Quirino of the Funky and Latin group of <em><strong>Penthouse 7</strong></em>, 1975-82, the Aldeguer sisters Lally and Terry, Chato Sugay, Pia Moran, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4725\">Vivian Velez</a>, Bella Dimayuga, pop legend Geleen Eugenio, &ldquo;Ms. Body Language of <em><strong>T.O.D.A.S.</strong></em>&rdquo; Frieda Fonda, and the &ldquo;Choreographer to the Stars&rdquo; Maribeth Bichara. Television reworked the vocabulary of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a>. For instance, the Aldeguer sisters reinvented the ballet genre and came up with their signature &ldquo;toss head back, pas de bourre&eacute;, cartwheel and split&rdquo; combination. This was later used by a new breed of dancers and choreographers like Eugenio, who worked with a group of sister recording companies: Electro Sound Center, Dyna Music, WEA Records, and other top record labels under one umbrella. The dance duo Geleen and John (Eugenio and Gaddi) which first danced on <em><strong>Penthouse 7</strong></em> later merged with The 8th of Sep, a group of modern dancers headed by choreographer Raffy Chan. Performing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/50\">cultural</a>, pop, and contemporary dances, they formed the WEA Dancers. The group got bigger with the addition of the WEA twins Joy and Gay Pobre and was eventually known as the WEA Family, appearing weekly in several TV variety programs, such as in one of the longest running TV variety shows, <em><strong>Superstar</strong></em>, 1972-89; <em><strong>Superstar sa 13</strong></em> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4851\">IBC 13</a>; and <em><strong>Superstar: Beyond Time</strong></em>, on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4860\">RPN 9</a>, both in the 1990s. As the WEA dancers dominated Philippine TV, Eugenio introduced signature steps such as <strong>new wave</strong>, <strong>the rock</strong>, <strong>punk rock</strong>, <strong>metallic gigolo</strong>, <strong>the wanderer</strong>, <strong>modern romance</strong>, <strong>curly shuffle</strong>, <strong>freaky</strong> and a variety of signature pop dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1980s, the disco with its iconic mirror ball and psychedelic graffiti was still popular, while the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/99\">street dance</a> style of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\"><strong>hip-hop</strong></a> and locking and popping of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/59\"><strong>breakdancing</strong></a> followed suit. The widespread new dance style of <strong>soul</strong>, <strong>funk</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/61\"><strong>jazz</strong></a>, <strong>rap</strong>, and <strong>r&amp;b</strong> eventually gave way to <strong>jazz funk</strong> which became the new dance vogue in both TV and films. The advent of retro-pop culture also saw the increase in number of international music labels and more commercial signature steps. Recording companies had in-house dancers for their labels: the WEA Dancers for Warner Elektra Atlantic labels; Vicor Dancers &amp; Vicor Crowd for the Vicor Music Corporation; the DYNA Dancers for DYNA Music; the Blackgold Dancers for Blackgold Records; the ALPHA Dancers for ALPHA Music; the PolyCosmic Dancers, Polycosmic Kukuz, and Polygram Dancers for PolyEast Records; and the OctoArts Dancers and Octo Mechanics, for Octo Arts/EMI Records. There were also ghost dancers or dancers who did not belong to the main recording label dancers but nonetheless promoted the same music as a follow-up promotion for the record company: WEA Pop Girls, Ral&rsquo;s Dancers, Disco Fantasy, Discorporation Dancers, Katz, Maneuvers, Knapsax, X People, Body Heat, Danz Promo, Kids at Work, Beat Culture, Abstract Dancers, Streetboys, and the Universal Motion Dancers. Members of these groups were regular dancers for top variety TV shows and also appeared in movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dance innovations or fusions, which were common in clubs, fitness centers, and parties, began to be featured in Philippine TV shows in the 1980s and continued to do so till the 1990s as local celebrities proved to be versatile performers who could dance with athletic grace and form. The popularity of these TV/movie idols saw the rise in the number of TV variety shows, which in turn increased the demand for dance groups for TV shows like <em><strong>Vilma!</strong></em>, later retitled <em><strong>Vilma In Person</strong></em>, 1986-95; <em><strong>Superstar</strong></em>, 1972-89; <em><strong>Maria! Maria!</strong></em>, later retitled <em><strong>Maricel Live!</strong></em>, 1986-89; <em><strong>The Other Side of Alma</strong></em>, 1981-83, and <em><strong>Loveliness</strong></em>, 1987-88; <em><strong>Manilyn Live!</strong></em>, 1986-88; <em><strong>Lotlot and Friends</strong></em>, 1985-88; <em><strong>Tonight with Dick and Carmi</strong></em>, 1988-91; <em><strong>Pops!</strong></em>, 1992-96; <em><strong>Vina</strong></em>, 1993-94; and <em><strong>The Sharon Cuneta Show</strong></em>, 1986-88, 1988-97, on IBC 13 and subsequently on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN 2</a>. With many stars having variety shows, the battle of opening production numbers began in the late 1980s and lasted until the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneous with the expansion of local recording companies was the birth of independent dance groups like the VIP Dancers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2559\">Powerdance</a>, Hotlegs, Adrenaline, Whiplash, Solid Gold, Discorama Dancers, Julie Borromeo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2498\">Dance Arts</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2408\">Veda Ba&ntilde;ez</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2536\">Metropolitan Dancers</a> which also shifted to commercial TV. The VIP Dancers danced for <em><strong>Vilma!</strong></em> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4766\">BBC 2</a> and later for <em><strong>Vilma In Person</strong></em>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a> was known for her death-defying dance routines in the show <em><strong>Vilma!</strong></em> With its in-house choreographer, Maribeth Bichara, it became the most awarded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1365\">musical variety show</a> in local TV history. The VIP Dancers&rsquo; style of dancing was diverse: <strong>commercial pop</strong>, <strong>street dance</strong>, ballet, jazz, <strong>gymnastics</strong>, hip-hop, <strong>ballroom</strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>folk</strong></a>, <strong>funk</strong>, <strong>broadway</strong>, <strong>theatrics</strong> or <strong>theatrical</strong>, and athletic dance steps were complemented by the use of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">props</a>. The movement combinations by the VIP Dancers paved the way for more dance fusions on Philippine TV which is seen until today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1990s witnessed crossovers from the 1980s. The developments in technology linked us to new video games, DJ scratching, line dancing, and other new dance styles like the <strong>tootsie roll</strong>, <strong>the jiggy</strong>, <strong>da dip</strong>, <strong>macarena</strong>, <strong>electric slide</strong>, and the <strong>running man</strong>. Associated with these dances was a range of looks and fashion styles such as the grunge look and hair spray, cargo pants and MC Hammer pants, Nike ball caps with tags, and chain necklaces with charms which were worn by many dancers on TV shows. Hip-hop, a major dance genre of the decade, was usually accompanied by a DJ&rsquo;s record scratching. Stunts such as leaps, somersaults, flips, rolls, hand stand, head stand, tumbling, and a combination of movements from gymnastics, ballet, ballroom, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/48\">cheerdance</a>, and other athletic moves were basic to this dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worldwide, the most popular dance was the <strong>macarena</strong>, with its signature arm movement combination and an eight-step line dancing. Locally, it was promoted by the Maneuvers. A number of pop-locking groups like Kidz at Work, Danz Promo, Octo Full Force, X-10, Universal Motion Dancers, Streetboys, Dyna Dance Squad, Teensquad, Abstract Dancers, and Sexbomb Dancers emerged at the time. The decade likewise saw the birth of a new genre, <strong>ballroom fusion</strong>, introduced by the VIP Dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The VIP Dancers also had their own show entitled <em><strong>Eezy Dancing</strong></em> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4975\">TV5</a>, 1995-98, which was later re-titled <em><strong>Keep On Dancing</strong></em> on ABS-CBN 2, 1998-2001, with the addition of Australian Marc Nelson. As ballroom dancing became popular on Philippine TV, it also became a sensation in clubs, afternoon discos, and bars. It also gave birth to a social but competitive dance, popularly known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/51\"><strong>dancesport</strong></a>. Later, this was showcased on Philippine TV by a reality dance competition program hosted by Lucy Torres-Gomez in her show <em><strong>Shall We Dance</strong></em>, 2005-10, which eventually became <em><strong>Celebrity Dance Battle</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, the ubiquitous <strong>street dance</strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>modern dance</strong></a> had movements borrowed from ballet or based on the lyrics of songs. <strong>Lyrical dance</strong>, or the new <strong>interpretative dance</strong>, falls under the category of hip-hop. The latter, which remains popular, borrows moves from different cultures and has changed the landscape of TV dancing. Meanwhile, a new generation of dance groups began appearing on local TV: the Dance Crews; the Philippine All Stars; the Intensity Breakers; the Team Imusenio; the Ad Lib; the Philippines Hip Dance Crew; the Philippines Underground Crew; the Extreme Boyz Gen San; and Jabbawockees. The latter is also known as the Fil-Am International Dancers. As a group, they won the 2006 and 2008 World Hip Hop Dance Championship. They specialize in a spin-off genre of hip-hop popularly known as <strong>urban dance</strong>. As b-boy dancers, many groups have also brought pride to the country by winning in international competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common among Philippine TV shows of the new millennium are permanent performers like the Sexbomb Dancers and EB Babes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><em><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></em></a>, the Go Girls of <em><strong>Magandang Tanghali Bayan</strong></em>, and the Showtime Dancers of <em><strong>It&#39;s Showtime</strong></em>. In the absence of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/27\">company</a>&rdquo; dancers dominating Philippine TV, there is now the G-Force which reinvented the urban style of the 20th century by pushing the limits of dance fusion. Collegiate pep squads have also become stronger and more competitive in both local and international cheerdance competitions. College pep squads have been invited to perform on local TV shows, and the UAAP Cheerdance Competition and the NCCA Cheerleading Competition are both regularly televised during the college athletic season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 2000s, TV dancing saw dances that shared the vocabulary of earlier dances. <strong>Krumping</strong> with its vocabulary of <strong>battle</strong>, <strong>biter</strong>, <strong>session</strong>, <strong>buck</strong>, <strong>call out</strong>, <strong>labbing kill-off</strong>, and <strong>jabs</strong> shares moves with hip-hop. Also incorporated in krumping&rsquo;s dance moves are different dance styles&mdash;<strong>pop and lock</strong>, <strong>chest pop</strong>, <strong>arm wave</strong>, and <strong>crisscross</strong>&mdash;seen on TV as dance groups &ldquo;battle&rdquo; with each other. But there are also viewers who feel that there are dances like <strong>twerking</strong> and <strong>pumping</strong> that have lost the &ldquo;story&rdquo; of dance by becoming too centered on the dancer and by displaying moves that are very sexually suggestive. Some groups associated with these are the V-Boyz and Men In Heels Dancing. These all-male groups usually perform very feminine routines, which have become popular on local television variety shows as well as online platforms like YouTube.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back at the development of TV dancing in the Philippines, it can be said that reinvention or innovation of dance genres is one of the reasons why dance on TV remains strong. Moreover, it has demonstrated that global influences have informed the evolution of various dance genres and forms.<strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Alberto L.

Associated with these dances was a range of looks and fashion styles such as the grunge look and hair spray, cargo pants and MC Hammer pants, Nike ball caps with tags, and chain necklaces with charms which were worn by many dancers on TV shows. Hip-hop, a major dance genre of the decade, was usually accompanied by a DJ&#x2019;s record scratching.
