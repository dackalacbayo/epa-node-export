In <b><i>Kinaadman</i></b> 1:151-227.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Agyu</i></b> is the epic of the Arakan-Arumanen or the Ilianon of northern Cotabato in Mindanao. It is closely related to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1974\"><b><i>Ulahingan</i></b></a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2359\">Livunganen-Arumanen</a>, with both epics having identical characters, because the two groups used to be one, called Arumanen. Agyu is chanted without the accompaniment of music or dance. The <b>likuen</b> (melody) is usually determined by the incidents being narrated. In battle scenes, for instance, the rhythm quickens and the singer is said to be <b>abmanna-hansang</b>&mdash;that is, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chanting</a> his lines in a staccato manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Agyu</i></b> is divided into two parts: the <b>pemahra</b>/<b>pamara</b>, or an invocation, and the <b>ulahingon</b>, or narrative proper. The ulahingon, in turn, consists of two parts: a <b>kepu-unpu-un</b> and a <b>sengedurug</b>. The kepu-un-pu-un is a standard narrative, although slightly different versions of it exist, about the history of Agyu&rsquo;s family and how they fled to Nalandangan and became immortal. It is usually recited rather than chanted. The sengedurug, the part that is chanted, continues the history and narrates the continuing adventures of Agyu and his relatives in Nalandangan. There is no single standard narrative for the sengedurug nor limit to the number of stories that can be told; hence, the multiplicity of Agyu stories. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">Epic</a> conventions that can be found in Agyu are stock epithets, including multiple names for one character or place; elaborate similes; hyperbole; the transformation of commonplace objects into magical ones, including the use of boats and kerchiefs as flying vehicles; the repetition of set descriptions; and the catalog of names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1913, Fay-Cooper Cole published stories of Agyu, which he described as a &ldquo;bed time chant.&rdquo; Tranquilino Sitoy of Misamis Oriental discovered another Agyu song and published it in English prose in 1937. In 1969, E. Arsenio Manuel transcribed the epic and titled it <b><i>Agyu: The Ilianon Epic of Mindanao</i></b>. His principal source was Blagtas Pandakan, then living in Lumut, Kallinan, Davao City. Blagtas Pandakan learned the epic from his uncle Sugalan, who had learned it from his father, Ampalid. Blagtas Pandakan was about 42 when, covering himself with a white blanket, he chanted the epic on the night of 9 May 1963. Assisted by Batooy Ambag, a son-in-law of a datu, and Pilisianu Tisio, Manuel recorded the epic from 21 Nov to 25 Nov. Manuel&rsquo;s version of Agyu follows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Living at the rivermouth of Ayuman/Sinimbulan are the three sons of Pemulaw, the brothers Kuyasu aka Banlak, Agyu aka Bagyasan / Datu Lungba, and Matilom aka Panganlawon/Lono. Agyu has four sisters, but only Yambungan and Ikwangan are mentioned in the Manuel version. Banlak&rsquo;s wife, named Mungan aka Paniguan, is badly afflicted with a consuming disease, leprosy. One of the subsistence occupations of the Ilianon people is the gathering of beeswax, which they trade with the Maguindanao, their distant neighbors, for articles and goods that they need. Although these goods and articles are not mentioned in the epic, they have been identified as cloth, blanket, swords, betel nut and lime containers, salt, and coconut oil. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a> depend much on other peoples for their supply of beeswax for caulking their vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One day Agyu sends his brother, Kuyasu/Banlak, to deliver nine <i>kamu</i>, or lumps of beeswax, to a Maguindanaon datu who is his trading partner. The Maguindanaon datu is irked at the meanness of the payment; and he hurls the beeswax at Kuyasu, hurting the latter&rsquo;s foot, which has an ulcer. Kuyasu retaliates instantly by spearing the Maguindanao datu in the chest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Banlak/Kuyasu hurries back to Ayuman to warn Agyu that the Maguindanao enemies are coming because he has slain the datu. Agyu decides they must depart at once for Mount Ilian/Mabpung, where Agyu orders his people to gather logs and a hundred stones each that will crush their pursuing enemies. They build houses and wait. Soon, the day darkens as thousands of Maguindanao warriors arrive, but Agyu and his people decimate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After this victory, Agyu chooses the land of Pinamatun, aka Maladamal, to settle in. After they have built their shelters once again, Agyu leaves for Sandawa mountain (Mount Apo) to hunt with his brother Matilom, who cuts a path on the side of the mountain. Their two sisters, Yambungan Pignayuan aka Paniguan and Ikwangan aka Kabuyawanon, are each carried on a hammock as they go into the forest to search for honey, which they find inside a palm tree. Agyu arrives with a wild piglet. The animal is cut into equal pieces, as are the honeycombs, and these are distributed among the people. Agyu suggests to Banlak that he give some to his wife, Mungan, whom Banlak has abandoned in Ayuman because of her affliction. Banlak refuses, and so Matilom volunteers to deliver Mungan&rsquo;s share of the food. Arriving at Ayuman, Matilom/Panganlawon hears what sounds like the shouting of thousands. He finds Mungan/Paniguan now fully healed and offering him a golden betel chew and <i>pinipi</i> (young rice).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Learning of his wife&rsquo;s recovery, Banlak decides to return to her. Agyu sternly forbids him, for he has already forsaken her. The betel nut and pinipi are distributed, and the people feel a new life coming to them. Agyu and his people return to Ayuman, but Mungan is gone, having already ascended to heaven and leaving behind her house of gold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Agyu and his people sail for 10 days until they reach Tigyandang aka Nalandangan. Here, they build their houses and declare it their new country. Agyu and his people are attacked. The men descend to the battlefield while performing the war dance. They fight the enemy by the bay of Linayangon. As they are losing men by the thousands, Tanagyaw, Agyu&rsquo;s youngest son and a mere boy, offers to meet the invaders himself. By the fourth day, all the enemies are slain. The defeated leader invites Tanagyaw, the boy, to come home with him, but the boy only mocks him for his defeat. When the datu arrives at his home, he finds Tanagyaw in his house after all. The datu has his daughter, Buy&rsquo;anon, dress up and come out of her room. He bids her sit beside Tanagyaw, give him betel chew, and consider him for a prospective husband. Buy&rsquo;anon invites him to sit on her lap, but the boy refuses, saying he is merely a boy and, as such, still in search of adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reaching the country of Baklayon, Tanagyaw finds the people troubled because they are about to be attacked. Tanagyaw is well received and is offered the datu&rsquo;s young daughter, named Paniguan (not to be confused with Banlak&rsquo;s wife, also named Paniguan). She appears, offers him betel chew, and asks him to be her husband, saying he will be their savior. Tanagyaw slays the invaders, but the datu&rsquo;s son, Bagili, challenges him to a duel. Tanagyaw defeats him and leads the people in a victory cry. The defeated datu departs in shame. Tanagyaw is offered betel chew and marriage to Paniguan but he now decides to go home, promising to come to this country&rsquo;s rescue whenever it is needed. But Paniguan accompanies him home. Asked about her identity, Paniguan insists on marrying Tanagyaw, who, after his initial resistance, is joyfully wedded to her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After some time, Agyu calls all his people to an assembly to announce that invaders are coming from across the sea. The old man Yugang/Layunlayun declares his intention to flee, but his fearless wife calls him a foolish coward and declares her intention to stay. The enemies besiege the country of Tigyandang aka Nalandangan. All the men, including the younger ones, descend to the enemy camp to fight but are defeated. Old man Yugang/Layunlayun again predicts their doom. Tanagyaw chastises him, puts on his breastplate of 10 layers, and picks up his shield and unbreakable spear. Then he slays the invaders, and their corpses pile up like mountains. The leader of the invaders invites Tanagyaw to his country. But Tanagyaw boasts that he has defeated the leader. The leader&rsquo;s son fights him, using a bar of gold. Tanagyaw in turn uses his <i>tanigid</i> (golden cane) and pounds the challenger to a pulp. The leader returns to his homeland, lamenting his own son&rsquo;s death. Agyu assigns the country of Sunglawon to his victorious son, who settles there with his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Knowledge about Agyu has been enriched with the publication of more episodes. In 1972, the Xavier Folklife Museum and Archives published &ldquo;Battle of Nalandangan,&rdquo; transcribed by Ludivina R. Ope&ntilde;a, as it was sung by Luis Pasal of Banud, Malaybalay, Bukidnon. She was assisted by Ametta Suarez Taguchi, Felipe Ando, and Antonio Magana. Ope&ntilde;a also discovered a song which she titled &ldquo;Agyu Gets a Husband for His Sister,&rdquo; in which Agyu searches for an underworld deity, Tumpas Namapiyaw, whom his sister Matabagka/Tabagka has dreamt of and wants as a husband. The deity pays no bride-price for Matabagka/Tabagka, although he wants to, because he was abducted while he was sleeping. He later saves Nalandangan from invaders while Agyu and the menfolk are away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;The Battle of Nalandangan,&rdquo; earlier discovered by Ope&ntilde;a, was also recorded by Carmen Ching-Unabia, as sung by Luis Pasal. However, Pasal added a description of Nalandangan, a genealogy of Agyu and his relatives, and a history of the sky before the actual narrative. Ching-Unabia&rsquo;s thesis includes three other episodes which she titled &ldquo;The Marriage of Tabagka,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tagyakuwa and the Black Datu,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Capture of Nalandangan.&rdquo; Besides Pasal, her informants were Jose de la Mance of Silae, Malaybalay; Manuel Himaus of Maluko, Manolo Fortich; and Anastasio Saway of Sungko, Lantapan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The latest addition to Agyu scholarship is Corazon Manuel&rsquo;s thesis, &ldquo;The Epic of Nalandangan: A Study of Two Songs,&rdquo; 1976, which includes the songs that she titled &ldquo;The Warriors of Saliga Attack Nalandangan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Matabagka Searches for the Deity of the Wind.&rdquo; In these episodes, Agyu&rsquo;s sister Matabagka is the hero. In the first song, Matabagka saves Nalandangan from invaders while Agyu and the men are away. When the enemies land, Matabagka puts on her breastplate, takes her spear and shield, and marches to the shore, while the rest of the women cry in panic. The leader of the invading Sagila is surprised to see a woman approaching them. He tells his men to drop their arms so that Matabagka may not be scared away. He plans to marry her. Matabagka seizes her chance and attacks the invaders. For some time she is successful, but her hair becomes her undoing. The leader grabs her by it, and she turns livid. Agyu arrives and sends her home, while he fights the surviving invaders. His spear magically fights on its own until it meets the leader, who challenges Agyu. Agyu kills him, but Agyu, too, dies. Agyu&rsquo;s shield guards his corpse until he is resurrected by the gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Matabagka Searches for the Deity of the Wind,&rdquo; Matabagka is again instrumental in saving Nalandangan from destruction. Agyu&rsquo;s <i>tumanod</i>, or guardian spirit, predicts that Imbununga, the god of the wind and thunder, is about to invade Nalandangan. Being less powerful than the wind god, Agyu is restless. Matabagka senses this and, learning about the prophecy, she rides her <i>sulindaay</i>, or floating hat, to look for the wind god. When Agyu finds this out, he sends Lumuganod, his military chief, to look for her. Matabagka reaches Imbununga&rsquo;s place. Imbununga is enchanted by her beauty and takes her as his mistress. Later, she charms him to sleep with a special betel chew. While he is sleeping, Matabagka steals his <i>baklaw</i>, in which he stores his powers. She escapes in her sulindaay. But Imbununga soon awakens and sends his warriors after her. Imbununga tells the wind to send the sulindaay to ground, so that his men can pursue Matabagka. She defends herself with her dagger. When his men ask Imbununga to allow them to burn her, he refuses. The fighting lasts for days, and Matabagka&rsquo;s skin turns dark. Lumuganod saves her and sends her to Nalandangan. There she tells Agyu what she has done and shows him the baklaw. She also tells him how Imbununga protected her from his own men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Agyu assures her that he will persuade Imbununga to join them, for his powers will be useful for Nalandangan&rsquo;s defense. Agyu meets Imbununga by the shore and bargains for peace. Imbununga, admiring Matabagka&rsquo;s courage, marries her. Peace is restored to Nalandangan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is suggested by critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5509\">Patricia Melendrez-Cruz</a> that the <b><i>Agyu</i></b> epic bears utopian suggestions. In an introduction to the epic, she notes that the description of Nalandangan is in the first-person plural and in the present tense, although the narrative itself is in the past tense and in the third person. Nalandangan, therefore, is both &ldquo;a mythic past and a future yearning&rdquo; (Castro et al. 1983, 191). Each time the epic is sung, the utopia that is Nalandangan is brought to mind. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by E.

She was assisted by Ametta Suarez Taguchi, Felipe Ando, and Antonio Magana. Ope&#xF1;a also discovered a song which she titled &#x201C;Agyu Gets a Husband for His Sister,&#x201D; in which Agyu searches for an underworld deity, Tumpas Namapiyaw, whom his sister Matabagka/Tabagka has dreamt of and wants as a husband. The deity pays no bride-price for Matabagka/Tabagka, although he wants to, because he was abducted while he was sleeping.

In the first song, Matabagka saves Nalandangan from invaders while Agyu and the men are away. When the enemies land, Matabagka puts on her breastplate, takes her spear and shield, and marches to the shore, while the rest of the women cry in panic. The leader of the invading Sagila is surprised to see a woman approaching them. He tells his men to drop their arms so that Matabagka may not be scared away. He plans to marry her. Matabagka seizes her chance and attacks the invaders. For some time she is successful, but her hair becomes her undoing. The leader grabs her by it, and she turns livid. Agyu arrives and sends her home, while he fights the surviving invaders. His spear magically fights on its own until it meets the leader, who challenges Agyu. Agyu kills him, but Agyu, too, dies.

Matabagka senses this and, learning about the prophecy, she rides her <i>sulindaay</i>, or floating hat, to look for the wind god. When Agyu finds this out, he sends Lumuganod, his military chief, to look for her. Matabagka reaches Imbununga&#x2019;s place. Imbununga is enchanted by her beauty and takes her as his mistress. Later, she charms him to sleep with a special betel chew. While he is sleeping, Matabagka steals his <i>baklaw</i>, in which he stores his powers. She escapes in her sulindaay. But Imbununga soon awakens and sends his warriors after her. Imbununga tells the wind to send the sulindaay to ground, so that his men can pursue Matabagka. She defends herself with her dagger. When his men ask Imbununga to allow them to burn her, he refuses. The fighting lasts for days, and Matabagka&#x2019;s skin turns dark. Lumuganod saves her and sends her to Nalandangan.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3803\">Emmanuel Torres</a>. Manila: Bookmark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is Torres&rsquo;s first volume of poetry, which consists of 13 poems previously published in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a> anthologies of winning entries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In these early works, several dominant themes and images emerge. Notable among these are images of people attempting to impose order on objects and natural situations that defy such order.

The persona of &ldquo;May &rsquo;Da Ko Bonoan&rdquo; (I Have a Fish Corral) is a fisherman who talks about the difficulty of harvesting fish from his corral, but he is grateful that the sea never fails to provide for his everyday needs. &ldquo;Pusdaki Uran&rdquo; (Come, Rain) is a farmer&rsquo;s prayer for the rain to quench the thirsty fields, sate the river&rsquo;s longing, soften the earth for the farmer&rsquo;s plow, give life to the hungry roots, and make the rice grow pregnant with grain. The title piece, &ldquo;Ayaw Pagpudla an Tuog&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t Cut Down the Tuog Tree), speaks of the responsibility of humans as stewards of nature. The poet adjures the human being not to fell the <i>tuog</i>,<i> </i>a guardian tree in the community, for it is home to natural creatures and other spirits of nature. The tuog is a Philippine hardwood threatened by extinction. The storms that batter Samar necessitate community bonding, exemplified in &ldquo;Pamadlos&rdquo; (Storm), where a man opens his home to a passing stranger as a storm rages outside, and thus earns the stranger&rsquo;s gratitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mercurio&rsquo;s love poems are fresh and charmingly naive, deriving their figures from the fishing and farming life of his community. In &ldquo;Dalan san Gugma&rdquo; (Love&rsquo;s Path), a young swain waits, apprehensive and excited, under the talisay tree for his intended to pass by; in &ldquo;Kirom-Kirom&rdquo; (Touch-Me-Not), a young man compares his beloved to the touch-me-not, which closes up quickly at his touch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mercurio also comments on the social scene. In &ldquo;Ginkawat san Balud&rdquo; (Stolen by the Waves), a woman recounts how she lost her child to a storm surge because her husband was too drunk to take care of his family. Drunkenness is a common domestic problem in Samar where coconut plantations&mdash;and hence, tuba (palm wine)&mdash;abound. In &ldquo;Bugiot san Parag-uma&rdquo; (A Farmer&rsquo;s Outburst), a farmer waiting in vain for rain recalls a politician&rsquo;s promise of having a water system built. The violence attending elections in Samar is treated ironically as &ldquo;Pasalida&rdquo; (Showtime), with election-related murders likened to twists in the plot of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1355\">TV serial</a>. &ldquo;Panhayhay san Usa nga OFW&rdquo; (An OFW&rsquo;s Lament) expresses a domestic helper&rsquo;s longing to go home to Calbayog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mercurio&rsquo;s poetry is written in the Waray spoken in the northwest part of Samar. This dialectal distinction adds charm to the poems. Moreover, the use of the dialect asserts the legitimacy of dialectal variances as a creative medium and demonstrates the versatility of the language that can mirror the many facets of life in Samar. Following the <b>siday </b>tradition, Mercurio observes rhyme and meter, but he does not adhere to the stanzaic form.

The two poems in Filipino are &ldquo;Ama&rdquo; (Father), which questions the wages received by the workers; and &ldquo;Kung Kami&rsquo;y Magkakapit-Bisig,&rdquo; which is the author&rsquo;s translation into Filipino of his poem originally written in English, &ldquo;With Our Arms Joined Together.&rdquo; It affirms the power of collective action against the landed class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 15 poems in the second section chronicle the stage in the poet&rsquo;s life when he was preoccupied with existential questions.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5466\">Bienvenido L. Lumbera</a>. With a preface by the author. Marikina: Talingdao Publishing House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The word <i>balaybay</i> means &ldquo;branches heavy with fruit&rdquo;; and <i>manibalang</i>, by which word Lumbera&nbsp;called his new poems, &ldquo;newly ripened.&rdquo; The collection consists of the poems in Filipino previously published in Lumbera&rsquo;s earlier collection, <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1895\"><i>Likhang Dila, Likhang</i> </a><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1895\">Diwa</a> </i></b>(Creations of the Tongue, Creations of the Spirit), 1993, which had gone out of print, plus previously unpublished poems. Included here are poems written in the manner of traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, such as <b>tanaga</b> and <b>uyayi</b>.<b> </b>There are also experimental poems, autobiographical poems, occasional poetry inspired by the deaths of political icons or rallies, song lyrics from his plays, and translations of three English texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his preface, Lumbera recounts the story of his development as a writer.

The Chabacano poems are placed side by side with the English translations provided by the poet himself. The first poem, &ldquo;Balsa&rdquo; (Raft), uses the metaphor of the raft to describe how one who is not anchored in an uncertain world is simply carried by the current. Hence, one must turn back to his or her roots to stay afloat and retain one&rsquo;s identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the poems belong to the tradition of Romantic poetry. Macansantos begins many of his poems with scenes of nature, which he then uses to create emotional effects. In between the nature scenes and the emotional effects or responses, the poet interposes rhetorical devices, most of which deal with abstract and grand ideas about the nature of memory, the eternal pull of family ties, and the search for identity. Some of these poems also gracefully weave the influence that his family has had on him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Na Pantalan&rdquo; (At the Wharf) describes the general ambience of the wharf&mdash;including the strength of the winds, and the island of Basilan that looms in the distance. &ldquo;Contra Biento&rdquo; (Against the Wind) describes the experience of being trapped inside a hotel while a storm is raging outside. Macansantos draws a contrast between the peace within and the chaos outside. He then links this to his father&rsquo;s bravery and how his father tried to instill the same bravery in him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are also poems about particular places in Zamboanga City. &ldquo;El Birhen del Lodasal&rdquo; (The Virgin of the Boggy Fields) describes a marshland and the statue of the Virgin Mary looking out beyond her fort. The poem becomes a metaphor for the hope that we keep within us when we get bogged down by the marshlands of our lives. &ldquo;Cesar&rdquo; is about the slain mayor of the city, Cesar Climaco. It describes the mayor&rsquo;s resting place, up in the hills of the city, and how now even in death, he still looks after the city he loved and served.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the best poems in this collection is &ldquo;Cruzando con el Rio&rdquo; (Crossing the River), which describes the persona&rsquo;s childhood memory of himself and his father taking a small boat to cross a river. There is another young boy who rows them to the other side. The persona muses on the stark contrast between their lives, yet he feels envious of the boy&rsquo;s abilities and the confidence that the boy&rsquo;s father has placed upon him. His own father, in contrast, tries to keep him away from the water throughout the trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the poet, the greatest pain is the loss of one&rsquo;s roots&mdash;one&rsquo;s history or family.

Schlegel mentions an &ldquo;immensely long cosmological epic&rdquo; called <b><i>Berinarew</i></b>, which takes 80 hours to chant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic begins with an Invocation, in which the chanter prays to the spirits for guidance so that his memory will not fail him. The epic is then summarized in a few lines: the hero, a <b>belian</b> (shaman), as yet unnamed, long ago, underwent suffering before he left this world to pay his respects to the Supreme Being in behalf of his people. The story proper commences with the shaman Lagei Lengkuos, aka Seonomon, instructing his followers on swidden farming, which is the <i>terasai </i>(suffering) they should undergo to attain happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lukes Libun interrupts them to announce that eight datus have abducted her daughter Seangkaien at the river. She holds Seonomon responsible because he is betrothed to Seangkaien. Seonomon consults his palm and shield but to no avail; it is the highest tail feather in his headdress who names the eight datus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Seonomon sends the wind to gather his forces. A catalog of his allies&rsquo; names is given as they arrive. They pray for a sign of victory, and deafening thunderclaps and a strong earthquake are the response. Seonomon flies on his shield, following the sound of the missing lady&rsquo;s weeping to the place of her abductors. One of them, Tuko Fenuo, sends his sister to serve betel chew to Seonomon, who attacks her instead. A battle with Tuko Fenuo and his people ensues, and Seonomon is victorious. He proceeds to Gentanga Lawai&rsquo;s place, where they parley on the violation of rights and their restoration. Gentanga Lawai&rsquo;s followers agree on their leader&rsquo;s wrongdoing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Seangkaien gives Seonomon a special betel chew, offering to &ldquo;enter the tassel of his necklace.&rdquo; Seonomon takes the chew but must resume the fight. He tells her to put on her best clothes and watch the battle from her window. His allies arrive and they form an impenetrable wall with their shields standing side by side. Gentanga Lawai strikes several times but fails to hit Seonomon, whose shield reproaches Gentanga Lawai for having claimed what was not his. Seonomon&rsquo;s allies join the fray but a goddess appears and commands Gentanga Lawai to return Seangkaien to Seonomon. Disgraced, Gentanga Lawai asks Seonomon to kill him; soon after, one of Seonomon&rsquo;s allies kill all of Gentanga Lawai&rsquo;s people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Seangkaien offers Seonomon her 10-meter long heirloom necklace as a sign that she wants their betrothal renewed. After serving betel chew to all of Seonomon&rsquo;s allies, Seangkaien walks home because riding on the shield with any of them would be improper. She comes upon Mo Legu, Seonomon&rsquo;s brother who resides at the <i>tadgeher</i>, the tree that is as old as earth, its top like gold and its branches like a rainbow. Seangkaien learns that he has arranged Seonomon&rsquo;s marriage with Datu Kadeg Teresang&rsquo;s daughter, Linauan Kadeg. Hence, when Seonomon pays her a visit, Seangkaien refuses to serve him betel chew. They argue over rights: his rescue of her has earned him the right to take her to his home, but she claims her right to be spared of humiliation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upset, Seonomon journeys through several levels toward Fulu-fulu, the Supreme Being (who is female), to ask for a bracelet with eight knots, which signifies passage from this world to the next. Menggerayur, a lower deity, advises him not to give up so easily. Fulu-fulu reminds him that whomever he gives the bracelet to will be his partner in leading the Tiruray&nbsp;to the land of happiness, and it is Seangkaien&rsquo;s destiny to be that partner. Seonomon despondently swears he would rather die than take betel chew from Seangkaien.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Seonomon is smitten by Linauan Kadeg. He gives her the bracelet with eight knots for her bride-price and they marry. Meanwhile, Seangkaien journeys through many levels, including Fulu-fulu&rsquo;s place, seeking aid to get Seonomon back and the bracelet. All the <i>lundaan</i> (spirits) reproach her for misjudging Seonomon. She finds a spirit-guide, her uncle Mangimfangalen. He summons his allies, who are datus and mountain spirits, whom Seangkaien leads into battle against Linauan Kadeg. She wins the friendship of Seonomon&rsquo;s sister, Lenolouon, and together they fly on a shield to Mount Keroon Kedataran, to plead for aid from Datu Fenrebangar, an ally of Seonomon. After reproaching Seangkaien for doubting Seonomon, he agrees that the bracelet must be for Seangkaien only. Three ladies&mdash;Seangkaien, Lenolouon, and Tama Talun, all flying on a shield&mdash;lead the fight, together with the datus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Seangkaien turns into a dove and joins Linauan Kadeg&rsquo;s seven other doves to recover the bracelet. When Linauan Kadeg feeds them, Seangkaien snatches the bracelet, which is concealed in Linauan Kadeg&rsquo;s diamond ring. Linauan laments its loss, and Seonomon tearfully reproaches her for having insisted on taking it as her bride-price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Seangkaien&rsquo;s allies penetrate Seonomon&rsquo;s fort of boulders and are victorious. Seangkaien offers Seonomon betel chew, and he reluctantly takes it. After chewing it, Seonomon dies. Seangkaien travels to the places of the dead to ask the guardians there not to welcome Seonomon&rsquo;s soul. She takes him to her house on Mount Lunggun Menurer and tries to revive him, but his corpse turns into liquid. Before it seeps into the ground, Seangkaien catches it in a bamboo container. She goes in search of his soul, finds it inside the tadgeher, and puts it in the tassel of her necklace. She takes him to her home and, with her brother&rsquo;s help, revives Seonomon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reunited, Seonomon and Seangkaien return to Mount Lengkous, where he tells his people that they must first suffer&mdash;that is, engage in swidden farming. On the eighth night, he dances with stamping feet and arms outstretched. The spirits of Linamasan come down to give a piece of land that all the people will ride on to the other world. Seonomon, however, chooses to walk. When they reach the gate of heaven, Seonomon tricks its guardian by giving him eight betel chews instead of eight persons as gifts. They cross the boundary and wash their bodies away in the Ligoden river. They walk past the land of &ldquo;continuous lightnings&rdquo; and of &ldquo;rainbows one over the other&rdquo; until they are finally welcomed by Fulufulu, who says: &ldquo;(Now) you have no more to worry.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In<b> <i>Berinareu</i></b> the tribes of Seonomon and Seangkaien unite and engage in a war for the sake of <i>sefebenal</i> or &ldquo;the right to seek revenge&rdquo; but in practice it means the right to restore a right transgressed by their common enemy. <b><i>Berinareu</i></b> is the only epic so far recorded that makes explicit statements about the defense and restoration of human rights. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Emmanuel V.

Alfonso appoints Don Sancho as general of the army and Don Rubio as captain. Unfortunately, both Don Sancho and Don Rubio fall in love with Jimena, Alfonso&rsquo;s sister. When Jimena spurns Don Rubio, he vows revenge. Don Rubio gets his chance when the love child of Don Sancho and Do&ntilde;a Jimena is born. He betrays the lovers to the king, who imprisons and blinds Don Sancho and confines Do&ntilde;a Jimena in a convent. The king entrusts the child to Don Rubio, with instructions to have the child baptized and brought up as he would his own son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The child, named Bernardo, shows signs of extraordinary strength. As a boy of seven, he can kill any animal with his bare hands. The king forbids Don Rubio from telling the child who his parents are and orders everyone in the kingdom, on pain of death, to do likewise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bernardo realizes that Don Rubio is not his real father when he tells Don Rubio to ask the king to knight him so that he can wipe out idolatry in the kingdom. Don Rubio scolds him for being too ambitious for his dim origins. Bernardo weeps, but the king adopts him and knights him soon after. Bernardo challenges Don Rubio to a fencing match and cuts him in two, thus unwittingly avenging his father. He also replaces Don Rubio as general of the Spanish army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At this time, a powerful emperor named Carpio sends an emissary to Spain, demanding its surrender. Bernardo singlehandedly wipes out the enemy. He asks, as his reward, for some information about his true parents, but the king sends him to attack Emperor Carpio&rsquo;s castle, hoping that he will be killed in the fighting. However, Bernardo conquers all the 19 castles of Emperor Carpio, who then confers on him the name &ldquo;Don Bernardo Carpio&rdquo; in recognition of his prowess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later, Bernardo is told the truth about his parents. Bernardo resolves to go to his father and mother, but first he conquers France. Bernardo is reunited with his father who, after blessing him and begging him not to harm the king, dies in his arms. Bernardo keeps his father&rsquo;s death a secret. He fetches his mother from the convent and takes her to the palace. Then Bernardo brings his father, covered with cloth on the pretext that he must not be exposed to the cold air, to the palace, where he is married to Do&ntilde;a Jimena by the archbishop. Only after the wedding ceremony does Bernardo pretend to discover that his father is dead. Jimena laments. After the funeral, she returns to the convent, and Bernardo, despite the king&rsquo;s pleas for him to stay as his heir, goes away to conquer all non-Christian kingdoms and to eradicate idolatry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After traveling for some time, Bernardo arrives before a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>-like structure with two lion statues guarding its entrance. Bernardo kneels to pray, when lightning strikes one of the lions. Bernardo vows to destroy the lightning. Not far away, he sees two mountains hitting each other. An angel tells him that God has sent him to tell Bernardo that the lightning has gone into the mountain, and that Bernardo can neither see nor capture it. When the angel takes the path of the lightning, Bernardo arrogantly follows, and the mountains close in upon him. The romance ends here, but legend supplies a coda, according to which Bernardo lies on a marble bed inside a cave. He tells a stranger who wanders into the cave that he will rise someday to save his oppressed people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bernardo Carpio is the only hero of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a> who has so captivated the imagination of the masses that they have adopted him as a kind of culture hero. Thus Bernardo Carpio has passed from the realm of romance to the common everyday world of Philippine legend, with places as far apart as Rizal and Cagayan province claiming that the mountain in which Bernardo lies is located there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Bernardo</i></b><i> <b>Carpio</b> </i>has been made into a movie, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4614\">Cesar Ramirez</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4729\">Alicia Vergel</a>, 1951; into a musical by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio Almario</a> and Tito Climaco in 1976; and into children&rsquo;s stories. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5284\">Damiana Eugenio</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5284\"> </a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Balmaseda, Julian Cruz.

Bernardo is reunited with his father who, after blessing him and begging him not to harm the king, dies in his arms. Bernardo keeps his father&#x2019;s death a secret. He fetches his mother from the convent and takes her to the palace. Then Bernardo brings his father, covered with cloth on the pretext that he must not be exposed to the cold air, to the palace, where he is married to Do&#xF1;a Jimena by the archbishop. Only after the wedding ceremony does Bernardo pretend to discover that his father is dead. Jimena laments. After the funeral, she returns to the convent, and Bernardo, despite the king&#x2019;s pleas for him to stay as his heir, goes away to conquer all non-Christian kingdoms and to eradicate idolatry."

An angel tells him that God has sent him to tell Bernardo that the lightning has gone into the mountain, and that Bernardo can neither see nor capture it. When the angel takes the path of the lightning, Bernardo arrogantly follows, and the mountains close in upon him. The romance ends here, but legend supplies a coda, according to which Bernardo lies on a marble bed inside a cave. He tells a stranger who wanders into the cave that he will rise someday to save his oppressed people."

In the third poem, &ldquo;Ark: September Evening, Hawthornden,&rdquo; a poet is adjusting to his new surroundings, intentionally misremembering the sound of trees around Hawthornden Castle as huge cavans of rice being poured into their bins back in the Philippines.

So unnerved, the poet turns the minor incident into a passage for a meditation on giggling stars and sizzling fires.

In &ldquo;Cure,&rdquo; de Ungria begs, almost admonishes, an unseen editor (presumably foreign) to publish his poetry precisely because it comes from a different place and is written in a different English. In &ldquo;Jam: Taxi,&rdquo; de Ungria listens to a Filipino taxi driver he encounters overseas soliloquize. The driver enumerates places like Paco and the Coca-Cola plant; at the same time and in the same tone he confides that the next block is where the bodies of the extrajudicially executed are dropped off. The sentimental longing for home is nipped in the bud by the mention of unsavory physical, cultural, and social realities. In &ldquo;Chiaroscuro,&rdquo; terror liberates, violence reveals, but meanings wave from a far-off place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Ungria begins with his strongest lines, relaxes, and then gradually builds to a crescendo by cataloguing until a well-deserved, if sometimes clipped, epiphany is reached. One finds this cataloguing habit in several poems: in &ldquo;Exits: Arriving at a Notion Of,&rdquo; a list of things to do and not do at a tourist spot; in &ldquo;Mass: Ode to the St. Thomas More Chapel,&rdquo; a rundown of the priests at the Ateneo chapel; in &ldquo;Xylograph,&rdquo; a series of short, almost treacle tercets cataloguing the items etched on wood engravings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last poem, &ldquo;Zense: Inside English,&rdquo; is a nod to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a> (&ldquo;Am here inside. Have come &hellip;&rdquo;), a playful exploration of a poet&rsquo;s sense of Zen, and a coming home of sorts into the colonial language English. &ldquo;Zense&rdquo; is a place, a home in complete contrast to the sense of doom in the earlier &ldquo;Chiaroscuro.&rdquo; Home is &ldquo;buried in me / like the sunsmell / on my skin.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Arvin Abejo Mangohig</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The driver enumerates places like Paco and the Coca-Cola plant; at the same time and in the same tone he confides that the next block is where the bodies of the extrajudicially executed are dropped off. The sentimental longing for home is nipped in the bud by the mention of unsavory physical, cultural, and social realities. In &#x201C;Chiaroscuro,&#x201D; terror liberates, violence reveals, but meanings wave from a far-off place."

Describing her innocence and spiritual beauty, the author sees her as the symbol and incarnation of his country in that era of the revolution against Spain. A tragic beauty, she is a victim of voracious designs. In quatrains of 11 syllables per line, Guerrero laments that morning liberty has not yet dawned for his beloved country and that &ldquo;todavia lloramos en la sombra&rdquo; (we still weep in the shadows). &ldquo;A Rizal&rdquo; (To Rizal), 1899, was written on the third death anniversary of the great martyr. He describes the sufferings of the Filipinos in the &ldquo;claws of the voracious eagles,&rdquo; with the guns and cannons of the revolution still booming in the distance. &ldquo;Tu Eres la Gloria&rdquo; (You Are the Glory) was written on the occasion of Rizal&rsquo;s birth anniversary, 19 Jun 1906, and dedicated to the Filipino youth. It is an impassioned and inspiring call to rise and fight in defense of their cultural heritage, to stand stalwart against those who have tried to impose foreign customs, culture, and language. The poem warns of the impending danger to the native Filipino soul, for submission would mean the prostitution of the soul of the race, a slavery more terrible than that which whips and muzzles. &ldquo;Una Fe y Una Corazon&rdquo; (One Faith and One Heart) is a call to unity addressed to the country&rsquo;s politicians, warning them against the division being wrought by the barbarians, whom the poem identifies as the American colonizers. Invoking the old traditions, he counsels them not to scatter seeds of discord among the people, giving as example the heroic insurgents of the revolution, who died crying &ldquo;Union for Liberty!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A poem dedicated to his wife is &ldquo;Petalos: A Carmen&rdquo; (Petals: To Carmen), which describes the pain of their separation during the days of the revolution and the passionate bliss of their reunions. It affirms that absence or distance heightens the rapture of reunion. The poet uses vivid imagery, metaphors, similes, and personifications to make this a sensual piece. &ldquo;Claro de Luna&rdquo; (Moonlight) is another love poem in quatrains of <b>rima perfecta<i> </i></b>(perfect rhyme), flowing euphonic verses, depicting a pure, powerful passion between man and woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Guerrero&rsquo;s poems demonstrate his definition of poetry as stated in his autobiography included in <b><i>Aves</i> <i>y Flores</i></b>,<i> </i>here in English translation: &ldquo;Poetry should vibrate with the trembling of the thoughts and emotions, a trepidation which can be born only from a deep sincerity.

No one wants to go there anymore, but his grandmother insists that there is nothing left there but memories. In &ldquo;The Zoo,&rdquo; the persona is a young girl who is frightened by the noises made by the caged animals and can find comfort only in the birds&mdash;an irony, as the birds themselves are trapped in the zoo.

In Keith Cortez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Collect Them All,&rdquo; the persona literally gives parts of himself to his beloved. He starts with his limbs and proceeds to his innards&mdash;an expression of a relationship that is built on installments. Anna Bernaldo-Romulo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jasper&rdquo; is about how the persona makes up the reasons for staying with her beloved despite the fact that one or even both of them are broken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The voices and themes in this collection are diverse, yet there is a certain sameness that runs through the poets: the largely urban settings, the preoccupation with romantic situations, the presence of alcoholic beverages, and a buried plea for the reader&rsquo;s understanding.

Translation into English, Sister Maria Delia Coronel, ICM. Marawi: Folklore Division, University Research Center, Mindanao State University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i><strong>Darangen</strong></i></b> is a body of songs or poems chronicling events in the ancient history of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, a people of Mindanao. It is one of the two types of epics sung among the Maranao. The other type, which recounts the relatively newer exploits of Muslim warriors against Spanish and American colonizers, is called <b>daramoke-a-babay</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American missionary and teacher Frank Laubach recorded and published one episode from the <b><i>Darangen</i></b><i> </i>for the first time in 1930. Since then, more parts of the epic have been gradually discovered and appreciated by non-Muslim societies. In 1902, a summary of an episode was made in the <b><i>Journal of</i></b> <b><i>American</i></b><i> <b>Folklore</b> </i>by a US Army medical officer assigned to Mindanao. Eight volumes of the epic have come out since 1986; two volumes in 1992, featuring the original Maranao text and an English translation, compiled by Mamitua Saber and Sister Maria Delia Coronel, ICM, under the foreign-funded Darangen Project of Mindanao State University. To date, 17 episodes have been identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The events chronicled in the <b><i>Darangen </i></b>are about the lives and times of royal families in ancient mythical Maranao kingdoms, which include Bembaran/Borantakan, Pangensayan a Rogong, Nataengcopan a Ragat, and Minirigi a Rogon. Bembaran is the most important of these kingdoms. The narratives are set in towns like Madaraba Kalinan, Bagomba-o Samakaet, Kodarangan a Lena, and Ondi-ayan a Tina. The epic unfolds through the complex genealogical interactions of the characters, with various episodes occurring as cycles identified with each Maranao clan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most important character in the <b><i>Darangen </i></b>is Bantogen/Bantugan, whose journeys and marriages and those of his sons are the subjects of most of the songs in the epic. The other major characters occupy leading positions in the royal genealogy: Diwata Ndaw Gibon, the first ruler; Tominaman sa Rogong, the eldest son of Diwata Ndaw Gibon and the father of Paramata Bantogen, the hero; Mangondaya Boisan, the second son of Diwata Ndaw Gibon; and Pasandalan a Morog, the eldest son of Tominaman sa Rogong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic&rsquo;s first song, only the English title of which is available, &ldquo;The First Ruler, or Diwata Ndaw Gibon of Iliyan a Bembaran,&rdquo; recounts the immediate lineage of all the major characters, the beginnings of the kingdom of Diwata Ndaw Gibon in the small settlement called Bembaran, and the names of the other kingdoms and of the kings who rule over them. The first marriage in the epic takes place between Datu Gibon and the princess Aya Paganay Bai from the kingdom of Minangoaw a Rogong, who is found after a long quest. Datu Gibon transforms the settlement into a kingdom by taking five other wives from neighboring kingdoms. The first wife resigns herself to her lot and leads the musical ensemble to welcome the other wives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Years pass and Datu Gibon dies. Tominaman sa Rogong, his son with Aya Paganay Bai, is proclaimed his successor. He ends up with eight wives. He sires 15 children, one of whom is Bantogen, who appears in the third song &ldquo;Kapmadali&rdquo; (The Story of Madali, one of the grandsons of Datu Gibon). Bantogen has just returned from his many forays into foreign lands, courting and winning women. One of his loves, Lawanen, turns out to be one of his sisters. Totally distraught, Lawanen is convinced by Bantogen that the tragedy has been willed by the gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Then a fight ensues between Bantogen and Madali. Bantogen thinks that Madali is responsible for the destruction of Bembaran, while Madali thinks that Bantogen has come to take Princess Danangkap. They later recognize each other as first cousins, and they embrace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two songs narrate the exploits of Bantogen: &ldquo;How Bantogen Died below the Mountain by the Sea&rdquo; and &ldquo;How Bantogen Came Back from Heaven.&rdquo; The king of Bembaran learns that his brother Bantogen has been courting Babali Anonan. He decrees that no subject should ever talk to Bantogen when he returns. The members of the royal council think that the edict is too cruel, but they submit to it anyway. Except for his son and his sister, no one else talks to Bantogen when he arrives in the kingdom. He makes his farewells to everyone and women weep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despondent, Bantogen runs in the heavy rain, removes his clothing, lays aside his blade, and lies down under a balete or banyan tree. He summons Magaw, his guardian spirit, who brings him to All the Land between Two Seas. There, Bantogen is nursed by Princess Timbang, who gives him a hammock and betel chew. She calls for a healer to bring him back to health, but Bantogen dies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The king of All the Land between Two Seas has Bantogen&rsquo;s body placed in a royal bed, adorned with flags and flowers, at the center of a great hall. Since he is a stranger to the people of All the Land between Two Seas, gongs are beaten to summon people who can identify him. Although 10,000 come in answer to the call, none of them knows him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Finally, Bantogen&rsquo;s parrot arrives, grieves over its fallen master, and faints. Revived with water, the bird identifies the dead man. The king places the body in a ship, while the princess sends the parrot back to Bembaran to make the sad announcement. The king of Bembaran faints upon hearing the news; the people are struck with grief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Mabaning and Madali learn about Bantogen&rsquo;s death, they ride their magic shields and fly to the sky world to retrieve the dead warrior. Mabaning disguises himself as a beautiful woman to make the Angel of Death think he has been given a wife by the gods. He asks the Angel where he can find <i>korna</i>,<i> </i>the fruit of heaven. As the Angel leaves him to obtain one, Mabaning loudly asks where Bantogen is. A tiny voice floats from a corked bottle, where Bantogen&rsquo;s soul is kept. Mabaning grabs the bottle and rejoins Madali. They zoom back to Bembaran. The hero&rsquo;s soul is released, and Bantogen is brought back to life. There is great rejoicing in the kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later, Bembaran is invaded by enemies who think that Bantogen is dead. With magic, he defeats the invaders. The war being over, he sails to distant lands and kingdoms, and marries several women: Maginar, Princess Minoyod, Princess Maginawan, Princess Timbang of All the Land between the Two Seas, Bolontai a Pisigi, and 40 other lovely ladies.

Reprinted, Davao City: Road Map Series, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This anthology gathers the literary works and prints of visual art by writers and artists in and from Davao. The book is divided into six sections: &ldquo;Poetry in English,&rdquo; &ldquo;Poetry in Pilipino,&rdquo; &ldquo;Short Stories,&rdquo; &ldquo;Art Folio,&rdquo; &ldquo;Biography,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Essays and Editorials.&rdquo; Capsule biographies of the 47 contributors are provided at the end of each volume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Eight Poems&rdquo; by Salanga relies on simple imagery: rain is the image for the writing process; old storytellers, for mortality; the moviehouse, for American hegemony; a clothes closet, for aging love; birds&rsquo; nests, for words that fly; mountains, for constant self-searching; the sky, for the masks that people wear; and ocean beds, for the passing of time. Among Lacambra-Ayala&rsquo;s three poems is &ldquo;Lost: One Rebel,&rdquo; a mother&rsquo;s deeply interiorized dirge for a child whose life has been sacrificed for a political cause. Paradoxical imagery is the main device in Lilia Lopez Chua&rsquo;s poems: &ldquo;Without Reaching&rdquo; muses on the paradox of things that stay out of reach when one waits for them but come closer when one stops waiting; in &ldquo;Departure,&rdquo; farewells are a preparation for forgetting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Seven of the nine poems in Filipino are untitled and have as their common denominators a stone, fire, a kite, and an ocean wave. Zelie Lorenzana,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3100\">Gus Miclat</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5072\">Jose Ayala</a>, and Sonia Solido all use the kite to represent aspects of human nature. Gwenn Bundalian depicts the life of the <i>bato</i> (stone), and Aida Cunanan likens <i>apoy</i> (fire) to a man&rsquo;s love for woman. The eighth poem, titled &ldquo;Gabi&rdquo; (Evening), is Mae Monteclaro&rsquo;s six-line description of evening; and the ninth, Wenzl Bautista&rsquo;s &ldquo;Singkamas&rdquo; (Turnip), likens this food item, dipped in vinegar and salt, to the process of falling in love. It is Nic Gabunada, however, who derives his imagery from a <i>lumad</i> (indigenous people) concept; his poem is a prayer that the <i>alon</i> (wave) would wash away the world&rsquo;s sins into the <i>pusod ng dagat</i> (navel of the sea).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two tales in English are Jorge Sabino&rsquo;s fable, &ldquo;The Sheep,&rdquo; and Jose V.

Among Lacambra-Ayala&#x2019;s three poems is &#x201C;Lost: One Rebel,&#x201D; a mother&#x2019;s deeply interiorized dirge for a child whose life has been sacrificed for a political cause. Paradoxical imagery is the main device in Lilia Lopez Chua&#x2019;s poems: &#x201C;Without Reaching&#x201D; muses on the paradox of things that stay out of reach when one waits for them but come closer when one stops waiting; in &#x201C;Departure,&#x201D; farewells are a preparation for forgetting."

Zelie Lorenzana,&#xA0;<a href=\"/7/7/3100\">Gus Miclat</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5072\">Jose Ayala</a>, and Sonia Solido all use the kite to represent aspects of human nature. Gwenn Bundalian depicts the life of the <i>bato</i> (stone), and Aida Cunanan likens <i>apoy</i> (fire) to a man&#x2019;s love for woman. The eighth poem, titled &#x201C;Gabi&#x201D; (Evening), is Mae Monteclaro&#x2019;s six-line description of evening; and the ninth, Wenzl Bautista&#x2019;s &#x201C;Singkamas&#x201D; (Turnip), likens this food item, dipped in vinegar and salt, to the process of falling in love. It is Nic Gabunada, however, who derives his imagery from a <i>lumad</i> (indigenous people) concept; his poem is a prayer that the <i>alon</i> (wave) would wash away the world&#x2019;s sins into the <i>pusod ng dagat</i> (navel of the sea)."

Cebu City: Aistemus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Composed of 61 poems, this book is divided into six sections: &ldquo;Nahumod sa Salibo&rdquo; (Drenched by Rain), &ldquo;Gibug-aton sa Panahon&rdquo; (The Weight of Time), &ldquo;Hilab sa Gakutoy nga Dughan&rdquo; (Desire of the Hungry Heart), &ldquo;Buhakhak sa Amang&rdquo; (The Mute Giggles), and &ldquo;Ang Kinabuhi Usa ka Bangkang Way Katig&rdquo; (Life Is a Boat without Outriggers). Each sequence contains 12 poems written in different styles, voices, and forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first section &ldquo;Nahumod sa Salibo&rdquo; contains poems that use rain as motif. It appears as drizzle, mist, and downpour. Passengers in a jeepney are lost in thought as rain begins to fall in &ldquo;Salibo&rdquo; (Drizzle). In &ldquo;Uwan sa Disyerto&rdquo; (Desert Rain), rain is personified and then likened to a prudent cat. In &ldquo;Balaki Ko, Day, Samtang Gasakay Tag Habalhabal&rdquo; (A Poem, Babe, While We&rsquo;re on This Fuckin&rsquo; Ride), a motorcycle driver courts his female passenger by asking her to recite a poem as they look forward to the blessing of rain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the second sequence &ldquo;Gibug-aton sa Panahon,&rdquo; Durado presents poems that describe the &ldquo;weight&rdquo; of instances and the space which time occupies. The poem &ldquo;Kadlawon sa Pasil&rdquo; (Pasil, Dawn) captures the morning rush in a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">marketplace</a>. Time is suspended in &ldquo;Pagkaugdaw&rdquo; (After the Fire), a poem that describes a neighborhood&rsquo;s daily routine violently disrupted by a fire. In &ldquo;Alang Kang Yana&rdquo; (For Yana), a father awaiting the birth of his daughter compares the moment to the lashing of waves against an island shore and the unfolding of dragonfly wings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third sequence &ldquo;Hilab sa Gakutoy nga Dughan&rdquo; features humorous and sensual love poems. An old man woos a young woman in &ldquo;Gurang Blues&rdquo; (Old Man Blues) by showing her his dentures. In &ldquo;Nganong ang Pizza Di Angay sa mga Tawng Lonely?&rdquo; (Why Pizza Is Not Good for Lonely Guys), a young man in a pizza parlor envies a pair of lovers. In &ldquo;Ang Babayng Way Bilbil&rdquo; (No-Fat Woman), Durado pays tribute to voluptuous women whose figure holds the mysteries of nature. In &ldquo;Ngano Man Diayg Bayulit ang Barikus ni Violeta&rdquo; (Violeta Has Purple Varicosities? So What?), a man dismisses his beloved&rsquo;s insecurity over her purple varicose veins, in the end reminding her that the tip of his penis is also purple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poems in the fourth section &ldquo;Buhakhak sa Amang&rdquo; break away from the usual structure of lyrical verse and take on experimental forms. In the darkly humorous &ldquo;Usa ka Gabiing Way Sud-an ug Way Bituon ug sa Akong Nasabtan ang Angay Basulon Mao ang Kulafung Gilaklak ni Papa&rdquo; (One Evening Nothing for Dinner and No Stars in the Sky and as Far as I Can See the One to Blame Is the <i>Kulafu</i> That Papa Glugged), a son witnesses a fight between his mother and drunk father, which ends with the mother butchering the father and cooking the different parts of his body. When they are through with him, the mother looks for a new husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the last section &ldquo;Ang Kinabuhi Usa ka Bangkang Way Katig,&rdquo; the poems are meditations on fear, courage, and human suffering. In the title poem &ldquo;Dili Tanang Matagak Mahagbong&rdquo; (Not All That Drops Falls), Durado describes a state of being in perpetual postponement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Durado commands a range of personas, poetic devices, and forms influenced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> radio dramas, the romantic Cebuano <b>balak</b>, and modernist and surrealist poetry. Fusing emotion and intellect, he searches for answers to philosophical questions in the lives of ordinary people. Durado employs colloquial orthography, terms, and idioms to create compassionate and impeccably crafted poems. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jeffrey Javier</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Fierabras, son of Balan, sacks Rome and Jerusalem. Carlo Magno sends Gui de Borgo&ntilde;a to retake the city, but the latter does not see Fierabras. Instead, he sees Balan and his lovely daughter Floripes. Peer and fair maiden fall in love with each other. Gui reports back to the emperor, who, displeased, sends him back. Gui is met by Floripes with her army, and he refuses to fight her. Gui returns to Carlo Magno, saying the enemy wants a truce. An impatient emperor sends Roldan and eight other peers to demand that the Turks leave Rome. Balan sends his brother Corsubel to the city with 50,000 soldiers. War erupts and Corsubel is killed. The peers return to France to offer their victory to Carlo Magno, but Rome remains in Turkish hands, and they are repulsed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fierabras rides to Mormondia, where the peers are camped, to avenge Corsubel&rsquo;s death. Carlo Magno orders Roldan to fight, but the latter refuses. Oliveiros is sent instead, who succeeds in defeating Fierabras and then persuades him to be baptized. Oliveiros is attacked and taken prisoner. Carlo Magno joins the battle with his forces, but four peers are captured. The five peers are then taken to Turkey, where they are thrown into a dungeon directly under Floripes&rsquo;s tower. Out of love for Gui de Borgo&ntilde;a, she lets them into her tower, nurses Oliveiros&rsquo;s wounds, and arms them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carlo Magno sends the remaining seven peers to demand the freedom of the prisoners. Meanwhile, Balan has sent 15 kings to negotiate the exchange of the peers for Fierabras. The two delegations meet at Mentible bridge, where a fight erupts. The peers kill and behead 14 of the 15 kings, then proceed to Turkey where they are welcomed by Balan, who is unaware of his emissaries&rsquo; fate. The remaining king who has managed to escape arrives to report to Balan, and the emperor orders the seven peers tied up. All 12 peers are sentenced to death, but Floripes has the sentence stayed. The 12 peers are reunited. With Floripes&rsquo;s help, they frustrate Balan&rsquo;s efforts to get at them. But they lose Floripes&rsquo;s magic girdle which staves off hunger, and they begin to feel hungry. They decide to hunt for food. Gui de Borgo&ntilde;a is captured and is about to be executed when he is rescued by the 11 peers. One of them, Ricarte, is sent to Carlo Magno to ask for reinforcements. Guided by a magical white deer, Ricarte hurdles obstacles and reaches France. Carlo Magno heads an expedition to rescue the peers. Balan is defeated and, because he refuses to be baptized, is executed. Gui de Borgo&ntilde;a and Floripes are married and inherit Balan&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One day, Santiago the Apostle appears to Carlo Magno in the form of a young man and tells him to conquer Galicia for the faith.

They build <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a> and wage more wars, defeating King Aigolante, Prince Furra, and the giant Farragus.

Carlo Magno sends an officer, Galalon, to this king to demand that he forsake Islam, be baptized, and render tribute. But instead Galalon plots with Marsirius to destroy Carlo Magno and his peers. They trick the emperor into sending the peers to Roncesvalles, where they are surrounded and attacked. All are killed except for three. A mortally wounded Roldan kills Marsirius, then flees to the mountains with Baldovino and Tietri. Carlo Magno learns about Roldan&rsquo;s death from the archbishop who hears angels saying that they are taking the peer&rsquo;s body to heaven. Baldovino arrives and confirms Roldan&rsquo;s death. Carlo Magno travels to Roncesvalles and buries his dead lieges. He has Galalon arrested and executed by quartering. Afterward, Carlo Magno entrusts all his wealth to churches and retires to Aquisgran, where he dies on 16 Feb 1012.

Author, Rio Alma (pseud. of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5033\">Virgilio S. Almario</a>). Manila: Aklat Peskador.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is Rio Alma&rsquo;s third volume of poetry, written in the early 1970s, during a time of social and political turmoil in the country, and covering a wide range of themes reflective of the poet&rsquo;s complex experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The title is a clear message of the poet&rsquo;s intent: to project a worldview that is rooted in the earth, anchored to the social realities of his time. The poems, directly expressive of this worldview, are set against the background of his intellectual engagement in the cultural activism that flourished during the years preceding the declaration of martial law. The world of <b><i>Doktrinang&nbsp;<strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong>pawis</i></b><i> </i>contains fresh and brilliant metaphors, with a delightful mixture of tones closely identified with the poetry of modern American and Latin American poets, always filtered with irony and detachment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collection consists of 12 books. As a whole, it presents the poet&rsquo;s changing perceptions of a society radically questioning itself. The first book, &ldquo;Sa Pagitan ng Hininga&rsquo;t Kamatayan&rdquo; (Between Breathing and Dying), locates the lives and deaths of people within those spaces which hardly call attention to themselves, overwhelmed by the power struggles of the privileged in an unequal society. &ldquo;Lakbay-Nilay&rdquo; (Ruminations), the second book, conveys the motif of journey, a pilgrim&rsquo;s progress through sights and impressions making up the poet&rsquo;s past. The third and fourth books oscillate from the very personal &ldquo;Pangungulila&rdquo; (Loneliness) to the deceptively charming evocation of bucolic peace in &ldquo;Tumatabal ang Talahib sa Taglamig at Tag-init&rdquo; (The Grass Grows Wild in the Cold and Hot Seasons), which seethes with subdued anger and violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Love in its various manifestations is the theme of the fifth book, &ldquo;Katekismo ng Puso&rdquo; (Catechism of the Heart). Here Alma experiments with different poetic forms (villanelle, sonnet, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>kundiman</b></a>)<i> </i>in presenting a gallery of assorted characters, such as Citizen Juan, the bored society girl, the American GI turned millionaire, and the famous movie director. Notable is the effortless weaving in and out of traditional forms such as the <b>oyayi<i> </i></b>(cradle song), <b>ambahan<i> </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a> oral poetry), and the folk song to create the different portraits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ninth and tenth books are composed of very short poems which contain vignettes of life, terse comments on society&rsquo;s lifestyles and mores. The eleventh book embodies the poet&rsquo;s doctrine of the common person.

The poems, directly expressive of this worldview, are set against the background of his intellectual engagement in the cultural activism that flourished during the years preceding the declaration of martial law.

The third and fourth books oscillate from the very personal &#x201C;Pangungulila&#x201D; (Loneliness) to the deceptively charming evocation of bucolic peace in &#x201C;Tumatabal ang Talahib sa Taglamig at Tag-init&#x201D; (The Grass Grows Wild in the Cold and Hot Seasons), which seethes with subdued anger and violence."

Ten of these songs were <i>agmaman</i> (chanted) by Baket Kinya Infiel, whom Norma Respicio recorded between 1985 and 1996 in Pagpag-on, Nueva Era, Ilocos Norte. The epic is sung in Inlaud, one of five major <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\\\\\">Itneg</a> languages. It is the language of the Itneg in Nueva Era, Ilocos Norte, and Cabugao, Ilocos Sur. The same chanter translated the songs into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, which Respicio translated to English. The two songs that have been published online were recorded, transcribed, and translated from 1988 to 1990. Three others have been summarized by Respicio and included in <b><i>The Literature of Voice</i></b>, 2005: &ldquo;Agimlang,&rdquo; &ldquo;Si Babey a Dulimaman&rdquo; (The Maiden Dulimaman), and &ldquo;Ti Paspasyal ni Ligi Wadagan ken ti Ay-ayam na nga Dumaygawan&rdquo; (The Adventure of Ligi Wadagan and His Dumaygawan Toy/Plaything).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic is sung as part of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> preparations for cultural activities, such as textile and basket weaving, or for community celebrations. It may be sung after lunch or before bedtime. The chanter and her audience sit on the floor, the chanter folding her legs up against her chest, her feet close together and flat on the floor. One song takes between an hour and an hour-and-40 minutes to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chant</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Itneg social structure, the <i>dulimaman</i> is a class whose members have supernatural powers and thus are of a higher status than the <i>babaknang</i> (traditional class). The principal characters of the epic are of this class. Additionally, as in many indigenous societies across the country, there are women who are kept isolated from the rest of the community until they are married. Among the Itneg, they are called <i>alimban</i>, just as among the Visayans they are called <i>binukot</i>. Alimban characters figure prominently in the <b><i>Dulimaman</i></b> songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Apo ni Bolinayen,&rdquo; Ligi Wadagan is a persistent suitor of Ayo, the mistress of the servant, Bolinayen. The reluctant Ayo flees him by first going to the Ilocos town of Santa. The wind sweeps her Itneg-woven basket away from her hand, and she is forced to replace it with the plainer Ilocos basket from the town market. She travels farther north to the town of Paoay, where she is taken in by a kindly but impoverished, old woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ligi goes in pursuit of Ayo and arrives in Paoay. At the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">market</a>, he recognizes the designs on the blankets that Ayo has been weaving for the old woman to sell. He follows the old woman, who invites him in for a meal. Seeing that the table is laid for three, he persuades the old woman to bring out the third person. After much pleading from Ligi and with the kindly woman&rsquo;s persuasion, Ayo finally accepts him, and the two live together as husband and wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The couple&rsquo;s abundant harvests from their swidden field become the envy of the Ilocano people of Paoay. Claiming that only Ilocano people should live in Paoay, they get Ligi jailed in Laoag. Ayo overpowers the jail guards and breaks Ligi out of jail. They flee toward Nueva Era, where they dig a well at the riverbank for the tired and thirsty Ayo. Then they resume their journey into the mountains of Abra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Istolya ni Gumigiteng&rdquo; (The Story of Gumigiteng) opens with the happily married couple, Ligi and Ayo, of Kadallayapan. The pregnant Ayo has a craving for the egg of the <i>lablabugauen</i> (wild fowl), which is in Gumigiteng&rsquo;s keeping in Namsangan. Ligi sets off to obtain the lablabugauen&rsquo;s egg. On the way, he encounters two alimban, who warn him of the fatal dangers ahead. He is resolute, so they give him a <i>binassaan</i> (richly brocaded wraparound cloth), which will fly him across the turbulent waters of the river and toward Namsangan. The women at the river direct him to Gumigiteng&rsquo;s house, the roof of which is of human hair, and they merrily predict that there will be a feast tonight. Gumigiteng and his wife, Donya Madilakan, eagerly welcome Ligi in, for their favorite dish is human fingers. Gumigiteng permits Ligi to go and get the lablabugauen&rsquo;s egg, but this is because it is caged by a fence with a saw&rsquo;s edge and atop a ladder with rungs made of knives. A friendly spider offers its web for Ligi to walk on, but on his way back, with lablabugauen&rsquo;s egg in hand, Ligi falls from the spider&rsquo;s web and onto the knives below. Gumigiteng gleefully calls on his townmates to help him chop Ligi to pieces for a feast. They use his genitals for the drumskin and stick. Ayo hears with foreboding the sound of the drums. She sees that her betel tree has wilted and realizes that Ligi is dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Years later, Ligi&rsquo;s son, Balballokanag, and his cousin Dumnaw take the same route to Namsangan to avenge Ligi&rsquo;s death. The two alimban who had helped Ligi before likewise give the two cousins each a binassaan to help them cross the same river. The cousins kill the man-eating couple. They put Ligi&rsquo;s bones together, and Balballokanag restores his life. The cousins slaughter the people of Namsangan and the river runs red. On their way home, they pay court to the two alimban, who, after some initial resistance, consent to leave their village and marry the youths. The village celebrates the recovery of Ligi Wadagan by the two youths and their joint wedding with the two alimban. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5200\"><strong>Rosario Cruz-Lucero</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Respicio, Norma A. 2005. &ldquo;<em>Dulimaman</em>, the Itneg Epic.&rdquo; In <em>The Literature of Voice</em>, ed.

The same chanter translated the songs into <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, which Respicio translated to English. The two songs that have been published online were recorded, transcribed, and translated from 1988 to 1990. Three others have been summarized by Respicio and included in <b><i>The Literature of Voice</i></b>, 2005: &#x201C;Agimlang,&#x201D; &#x201C;Si Babey a Dulimaman&#x201D; (The Maiden Dulimaman), and &#x201C;Ti Paspasyal ni Ligi Wadagan ken ti Ay-ayam na nga Dumaygawan&#x201D; (The Adventure of Ligi Wadagan and His Dumaygawan Toy/Plaything)."

Among the Itneg, they are called <i>alimban</i>, just as among the Visayans they are called <i>binukot</i>. Alimban characters figure prominently in the <b><i>Dulimaman</i></b> songs."

The wind sweeps her Itneg-woven basket away from her hand, and she is forced to replace it with the plainer Ilocos basket from the town market.

On the way, he encounters two alimban, who warn him of the fatal dangers ahead. He is resolute, so they give him a <i>binassaan</i> (richly brocaded wraparound cloth), which will fly him across the turbulent waters of the river and toward Namsangan. The women at the river direct him to Gumigiteng&#x2019;s house, the roof of which is of human hair, and they merrily predict that there will be a feast tonight. Gumigiteng and his wife, Donya Madilakan, eagerly welcome Ligi in, for their favorite dish is human fingers. Gumigiteng permits Ligi to go and get the lablabugauen&#x2019;s egg, but this is because it is caged by a fence with a saw&#x2019;s edge and atop a ladder with rungs made of knives. A friendly spider offers its web for Ligi to walk on, but on his way back, with lablabugauen&#x2019;s egg in hand, Ligi falls from the spider&#x2019;s web and onto the knives below. Gumigiteng gleefully calls on his townmates to help him chop Ligi to pieces for a feast. They use his genitals for the drumskin and stick. Ayo hears with foreboding the sound of the drums.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\">Rolando S. Tinio</a>. n.p.: Heart-Throbs and Other Beats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 45 poems in this book are grouped into four sections. The first section &ldquo;Bagay-bagay&rdquo; (Things) opens with &ldquo;Alitaptap&rdquo; (Firefly), which states the unifying theme of the section and the book: intelligence is like handcuffs preventing one from discovering the wonders of life, here symbolized by the night air filled with fireflies. Tinio seems to set up an opposition between purely conceptual thinking, on the one hand, and immersion in sensory experience or interaction with actual things, on the other. In &ldquo;Ang Bentilador&rdquo; (The Electric Fan), the cool breeze from a fan provokes the persona into thinking about perception. A longer poem with a similar subject, &ldquo;Pagkamulat ng Makata&rdquo; (Poet&rsquo;s Enlightenment) describes in detail the goings-on inside the mind of a writer from the moment he wakes up in the morning. By the end of the poem, the writer realizes that only by interacting with the real world can one experience life to the fullest. In these philosophical poems, Tinio turns to everyday objects and experiences and uses ordinary language&mdash;characteristics of <b>bagay</b> poetry, with which Tinio is identified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second section, titled &ldquo;Mga Kuwadrong Panlipunan&rdquo; (Portraits of Society), consists of seven poems presenting historical events, such as the Vietnam War, an eclipse in Africa, and the bombing of Hiroshima. Many of the poems, like &ldquo;Ang Maestra&rdquo; (The Female Teacher) and &ldquo;Eklipse sa Aprika&rdquo; (Eclipse in Africa), are studies of human character in extreme situations. In &ldquo;Alaala ng Hiroshima&rdquo; (Remembering Hiroshima), the poet vividly but impersonally describes the bombing of the city in Aug 1946. The tension between the object of description&mdash;the catalog of victims&mdash;and the method of description adds to the reader&rsquo;s sense of horror at that event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tinio&rsquo;s lyricism is given space in the third section of the book, &ldquo;Mga Awit ng Pagmamahal&rdquo; (Love Songs). The poems are about lovers&rsquo; experiences as they go through a romantic relationship, from the euphoria of finding an apparent soul mate to the despondency of affection ending. Tinio proves himself capable of writing in traditional forms without sinking into sentimentality or resorting to worn-out expressions. &ldquo;Irog na Napasaan&rdquo; (Lost Beloved) is in the <b>tanaga</b> stanza, a heptasyllabic monorhyming quatrain, but Tinio leaves one line unrhymed in every stanza, a note of dissonance that is appropriate to the theme of disaffection. He uses mostly rhetorical questions and ends with the image of a setting moon instead of using direct statements, which is the traditional way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the fourth section, Tinio reflects on the ideas of philosophers. Most of the poems, like in &ldquo;Mga Ehersisyong Analitiko&rdquo; (Analytical Exercises) and &ldquo;Mga Solilokyong Hango kay Sartre&rdquo; (Sartre-Inspired Soliloquies), are serious in tone; but &ldquo;Payo sa Bumabasa ng Tula&rdquo; (Advice to the Reader of Poems), in likening the act of reading to eating a mango, can be humorous. In either case, the richness of language and varied rhythms are employed here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fifth section consists of the lyrics of the 12 songs in Tinio&rsquo;s play <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/605\"><strong>May Katwiran ang Katwiran</strong></a> </i></b>(Reason Has Its Reason). These have the qualities of the other poems in the collection. The songs are very witty and show the funny predicament that the rich and the miserable Filipinos find themselves in as they confront the issue of social justice. The songs depict the disadvantages and benefits of being either wealthy or poor.

Editor, Gemino H. Abad. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"WorksBodyTextnotab\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The series of anthologies provides a comprehensive overview of the development of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> and Abad&rsquo;s theory of poetry as an act of writing <i>from</i> a language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first anthology covers verse and poetry written between 1905 and the mid-1950s, although the first poem, &ldquo;Where Is My May?&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5349\">Fernando Ma. Guerrero</a>, is dated 1912. Abad and Manlapaz chose 330 poems by 80 poets from a corpus of some 10,000. Abad&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;Rereading Past Writ: An Introduction&rdquo; explains the book&rsquo;s title, principle of organization, and ultimate criterion. He cites the difference between poem and verse as the critical turn in how Filipino poets came to write <i>from </i>English, rather than <i>in </i>English: an awareness of poetry as an utterance that artfully makes use of a language as guided by a unique sensibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poets are all Filipinos except for one. Poems were chosen with the following in mind: the poem itself; the possible reader; its reflection of the poet&rsquo;s work and development; the total range of poetic forms and experiments; evidence of relations between poet and milieu. The choice and arrangement are, as Abad says, &ldquo;already a reading of the poems.&rdquo; Part 1, &ldquo;Clearing the Ground,&rdquo; includes such poets as Fernando Ma. Guerrero, Juan F. Salazar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5494\">Fernando M.

Part 3, &ldquo;Toward a New Clearing,&rdquo; starts with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>, who has the most poems in the book, and includes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5686\">Bienvenido N.

Citing Daguio&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Man of Earth&rdquo; as a turning point, Abad argues that Filipino poets, by virtue of their reality and own agency, began to write <i>from</i>, rather than <i>in</i>, English. Revisiting the myth of the Filipino as originating from the bamboo, the persona in the poem ultimately rejects the comparison, instead asserting that he &ldquo;will be a man.&rdquo; For Abad, the poem illustrates how English is used to affirm the Filipinos&rsquo; sense of themselves and their reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>A Native Clearing </i></b>presents 49 poets and 383 poems. The book is divided into two parts. &ldquo;The Persevering Muse&rdquo; consists of poems by transitional figures already in the first anthology: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5578\">C. V. Pedroche</a>, Bienvenido N. Santos, Dominador I. Ilio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5779\">Manuel A. Viray</a>, Nick Joaquin, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5570\">Benjamin Pascual</a>. As the section title suggests, &ldquo;Through the &rsquo;50s and the &rsquo;60s to the Present&rdquo; consists of poems by poets who began to be published in the 1950s and 1960s, although many of them continued to write in the decades that followed. They include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5728\">Edith L.

Guillermo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5103\">Cirilo F. Bautista</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poems in this section bear the influence of the New Criticism&mdash;a bias for irony, paradox, and tension. Tiempo and Demetillo are credited for heralding the New Critical phase of Philippine poetry in English, so they head the roster. But Abad also notes other influences, including Villa, the French Symbolists, Chinese and Japanese poets, and the Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop, with which the Filipino poets engaged in the practice of their craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The series is concluded in <b><i>A Habit of Shores</i></b>, 1999. Abad presents a &ldquo;historical cartography&rdquo; of Philippine poetry, in which he divides it into three broad and overlapping phases or strains: &ldquo;an inveterate Romantic spirit &hellip; then, an enduring formalist or &lsquo;New Critical&rsquo; concern &hellip; and finally, an open, liberative or post-structuralist space.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The anthology proper consists of 96 poets&mdash;the eldest (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5144\">Luis Cabalquinto</a>) of them born in 1935 and the youngest (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5195\">Conchitina R. Cruz</a>) in 1976&mdash;and 388 poems, and is illustrative of the last phase in Abad&rsquo;s classification. The poems from the 1970s evince a loosening of the New Critical grip, at least in its the preoccupation with figures and the its assumption that the poem is an autonomous verbal icon. Extending a line that goes back to Ponciano Reyes&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Flood,&rdquo; 1905, the poems also reflect the political upheavals and social realities of the time, such as are described in the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5011\">Mila D. Aguilar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5428\">Emmanuel Lacaba</a>. The trend was already reflected in the works published in the late 1960s and the 1970s of some of the poets included in <b><i>A Native Clearing</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1980s show that the poets were being infected by critical theories of structuralism and post-structuralism. Abad also notes the increase in the number of women poets, 30 in this anthology compared to 5 in the second. They include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5034\">Merlie M. Alunan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5436\">Marra PL. Lanot</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5501\">Elsa Martinez Coscolluela</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5729\">Rowena Tiempo Torrevillas</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5286\">Marjorie Evasco</a>. There are also a number of expatriate writers&mdash;Cabalquinto, Myrna Pe&ntilde;a-Reyes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5012\">Ma. Luisa B. Aguilar Cari&ntilde;o</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5305\">Luis H. Francia</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5319\">Eric Gamalinda</a>. Among the other poets represented are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5667\">Alfrredo Navarro Salanga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5675\">Wilfredo Pascua Sanchez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5167\">Erwin E. Castillo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5794\">Alfred A. Yuson</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5241\">Ricardo M. de Ungria</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5424\">Marne Kilates</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5714\">Ramon C.

Lim-Wilson</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5326\">J. Neil C. Garcia</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The value of the three anthologies lies not only in that they give readers access to the poems but also in that they provide a scholarly apparatus. The biographical notes, sources, and notes on the poems, running close to 200 pages in each volume, is veritably a book in itself. This series is the first of its kind in coverage and purpose: to reread past writ, works largely unavailable and thus long unread. To the scholar, it gives evidence for literary history; to the critic, the context against which to evaluate; and to the poet, an indication of heritage. The handmaid, as it were, to the anthologies is Abad&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1636\"><b><i>Our Scene So Fair: Filipino <strong>Poetry</strong> in English, 1905-1955</i></b></a>, 2008, a collection of his critical essays. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

Cruz</a>) in 1976&#x2014;and 388 poems, and is illustrative of the last phase in Abad&#x2019;s classification. The poems from the 1970s evince a loosening of the New Critical grip, at least in its the preoccupation with figures and the its assumption that the poem is an autonomous verbal icon. Extending a line that goes back to Ponciano Reyes&#x2019;s &#x201C;The Flood,&#x201D; 1905, the poems also reflect the political upheavals and social realities of the time, such as are described in the works of <a href=\"/9/9/5011\">Mila D.

This series is the first of its kind in coverage and purpose: to reread past writ, works largely unavailable and thus long unread.

In the process, it entered folk consciousness with the force of transmitted wisdom. The greatness of the work rests on the author&rsquo;s ability to comply with the accepted technical conventions of the <b>awit<i> </i></b>or metrical romance while at the same time introducing innovations which improved on the genre. These include using a dedicatory poem to a woman instead of the usual religious invocation; the use of flashback instead of strict chronological sequencing of events; the use of classical allusions which are not stereotyped or inaccurate but are apt and carefully explained in footnotes; the absence of magic objects and occurrences; and, perhaps the most significant, the unconventional portrayal of Muslim characters&mdash;Aladin and Flerida&mdash;as male and female heroes comparable in virtue to their Christian counterparts Florante and Laura.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The opening scene is a dark forest, where Florante has been tied to a tree and exposed to the predators of the wild. While lamenting his fate, he is threatened by two lions. A brave Persian warrior, Aladin, arrives in time to rescue the helpless Florante. Aladin is a fugitive, his beloved Flerida having been taken away from him by his own father. The two warriors become friends, and they unravel to each other the story of their lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Florante is the son of Duke Briseo and Princess Floresca of the kingdom of Albania. After spending a happy childhood in Albania, he is sent to Athens to be educated. Here Florante so excels in his studies that he incurs the envy and ire of countryman Adolfo, who attempts to kill him but is thwarted by the timely intervention of Menandro, the hero&rsquo;s bosom friend. Called home to Albania by the death of his mother, Florante is taken into the service of the king as general of the army. In the royal court, he meets and falls in love with Laura, the king&rsquo;s beautiful daughter. Inspired by Laura and aided by Menandro, Florante wins his first big battle against the Persian army invading Krotona. Returning, they find Albania under Persian occupation. They rescue Laura from her captors, recover the kingdom, and release the king, the duke, and the other nobles, including Adolfo, from prison. Laura bestows her love on Florante.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Albania enjoys peace only briefly. A Turkish army invades, led by the renowned Miramolin. Florante defeats him, then goes on an all-out crusade against the Moors. While he is away, Adolfo usurps the throne, has the king and his father killed, and tries to force Laura to marry him. Recalled home by a letter forged by Adolfo, Florante is seized and imprisoned. Laura intervenes, and instead of being beheaded, Florante is taken to the dark forest and bound to a tree, where Aladin finds him. The two live in the forest for five months, at the end of which they are reunited with their sweethearts, who also happen to be there. Flerida has escaped from Persia on the eve of her wedding to Aladin&rsquo;s father. In her wanderings, she comes upon Adolfo about to ravish Laura, and she kills the tyrant with her arrow. The happiness of the four lovers is made complete by the arrival of Menandro, who has recovered Albania from the forces of Adolfo. Florante and Laura take Aladin and Flerida to Albania where the two Persians are baptized as Christians. A double wedding ensues. Florante ascends to the Albanian throne and with Laura rules long and peacefully. The Albanians live happily ever after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As in other Philippine metrical romances, the didactic element in <b><i>Florante at Laura</i></b><i> </i>is deliberately emphasized and accounts greatly for the work&rsquo;s popularity. The work abounds in precepts and proverb-like passages for a great many themes in human society&mdash;friendship, betrayal, the rearing of children, the power of love, the perversion of love, the evils of tyranny expressed in beautiful and memorable assonantal couplets and quatrains, and in majestic dodesyllabic meter. The most popular include the following: &ldquo;Ang laki sa layaw, karaniwa&rsquo;y hubad / Sa bait at muni&rsquo;t, sa hatol ay salat&rdquo; (Reared in ease, one is deficient / In good sense and judgment); &ldquo;O pagsintang labis na makapangyarihan / Sampung mag-aama&rsquo;y iyong nasasaklaw / Pag ikaw ang nasok sa puso ninuman / Hahamaking lahat masunod ka lamang&rdquo; (Love, your allure&rsquo;s overpowering / And you rule over both fathers and sons / When you enter the heart of anyone / He would defy all to follow your bidding); &ldquo;Sa loob at labas ng bayan kong sawi / Kaliluha&rsquo;y siyang nangyayaring hari / Kagalinga&rsquo;t bait ay nalulugami / Ininis sa hukay ng dusa&rsquo;t pighati&rdquo; (Throughout my pitiful country / Everything&rsquo;s fallen to vile tyranny / All goodness and wisdom are given no mercy / Strangled to the grave by dire misery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Florante at Laura </i></b>has been studied in high school for decades.

Transcriber, Esterlinda Mendoza-Malagar, &ldquo;The Guman of Dumalinao: A Suban-on Epic,&rdquo; <b><i>Kinaadman </i></b>2 (1980): 275-380.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Guman </b>is the generic term for epic among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a>, a sub-Visayan mountain folk of the Zamboanga Peninsula. However, it is also the title given to the first full-length Subanon epic to be recovered and published. It has over 4,000 lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Esterlinda Mendoza-Malagar recorded the epic in 1971. Her sources were Cabao Talpis, who served as her informant, and Pilar Talpis, who chanted the guman. Both hail from Dumalinao, Zamboanga del Sur. Her work was submitted to the Graduate School of Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro in 1972 and was later published in <b><i>Kinaadman</i></b>,<i> </i>1980. Portions of the text and its English translation also appeared in an anthology of Philippine folk literature by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5284\">Damiana Eugenio</a> in 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic has two similar plots, which vary only in the names of the characters and in some minor details. The kingdom of Mount Dliyagn is set in the mountainous regions of the Zamboanga Peninsula, which is drained by a straight river whose bottom is lined with porcelain and beads of gold, and whose banks are bordered by flowering plants. Datu Pombnwa, his wife Baysalaga, and their young daughter rule the kingdom. They live in an eight-room mansion with furniture made of gold. Datu Pombnwa and Baysalaga used to have other children, but their daughters drowned in the river, and their sons, venturing out in search of them, failed to return. The other members of the household are Sampilakn and Tinayobo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One day, while Datu Pombnwa is making a shield, he hears disturbing sounds from the sea. War vessels are coming. Tinayobo sounds the magical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>, and as she beats them, the mast and the outriggers of the invading ships are shattered. After six days, the enemies, sent by three evil queens, land. They start to scale the mountain to reach the kingdom, but because the mountain keeps growing taller, it takes the invaders a month and a half to reach the summit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When they reach the royal household, the invaders are met by Tinayobo. They strike her with a <i>kampilan </i>or blade, but the blow lands on the porch, damaging it. Tinayobo restores it in a flash. Datu Pombnwa and Sampilakn join in the fight. After a month, however, the two old warriors grow exhausted, and they fall to the ground. This prompts their daughter, Ba-e ri Dliyagn, to fight. Initially, she successfully battles the enemies, but after a month, she is bathed in blood. Thinking her dead, the enemies abandon her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A young man, Sakandal, told that Dliyagn is under attack, comes to help. He restores the princess&rsquo;s spirit and beauty. As he goes to the mansion with her, the strength of Datu Pombnwa and Sampilakn is restored. The ba-e&rsquo;s parents take notice of the young man and hope that he will propose to their daughter someday. The daughter is then given a name, Pailalam ri Bolak, for she has come of age. She is also given a chewing box. As she chews, her beauty increases. She then learns about her brothers and sisters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Sakandal goes to battle in the kingdom of Tomanong. For days, Pailalam ri Bolak observes him from the mansion&rsquo;s porch as he fights. Sakandal meets the chief of the Tomanong. As they fight with their kampilan, the enemy causes the river to be overrun by fire, but Sakandal extinguishes it with a flood. After two weeks of fighting, the chief of Tomanong retreats almost lifeless. Sakandal, too, is exhausted, but Pailalam ri Bolak fans him and restores his strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pailalam ri Bolak receives a message from the maiden of Patola, who is asking whether she should go with a stranger who has come to Mount Patola. Sakandal takes his ring and gives it to Pailalam ri Bolak, telling her to knot it in the kerchief and send it to the maiden of Patola. The invaders arrive ahead of Sakandal&rsquo;s ring. The ring drops and becomes unknotted. Out of the ring comes a man named Salilayan. He helps defeat the invaders. The kerchief returns to the mansion, and Sakandal asks Pailalam what else he can do for her. She asks him to lend her his magical powers. She is given a kerchief with 18 rings knotted to it. She disappears from the spot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The guman shifts to the kingdom of Pagkatologon. The kingdom is in the same situation as Dliyagn. With no fighting men, the women of the kingdom are inspired to fight. A man named Madlawe helps them, just as Sakandal has helped Pailalam ri Bolak. The second part, however, may be said to be more magical than the first. Pailalam ri Bolak reappears to take an important<b><i> </i></b>role. The guman ends with the return of the missing children. A traditional <i>buklog </i>or feast is held to celebrate the union of the two kingdoms. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Servando Halili Jr</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Malagar, Esterlina Mendoza. 1980. &ldquo;The Guman of Dumalinao: A Suban-on Epic.&rdquo; <em>Kinaadman </em>2:275-380.<br />\r\n&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. 1980. &ldquo;The Suban-on and the Guman: Introductory Essay.&rdquo; <em>Kinaadman </em>2:253-74.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

In &ldquo;Cine-Renacimiento&rdquo; (Renaissance Cinema), the reader is invited to scrutinize four &ldquo;films,&rdquo; each featuring the villain as devoid of honor and integrity: a proud but worthless writer, a wealthy politician who turns away a pauper asking for help, a priest feigning holiness, and a cunning suitor who wins the leading lady by threatening the life of his rival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Poems published in 1923-30 hew to the conventions of traditional Tagalog poetry, which is typically didactic, conservative, and sentimental.

In &ldquo;Independence Congress,&rdquo; the persona satirizes the collusion between his fellow politicians and the American colonial government to impede the nation&rsquo;s struggle for independence.

Eliot, Pablo Neruda, Rainer Maria Rilke, Salvatore Quasimodo, and other modern poets. The political developments of the succeeding decades further sharpened the literary craft of Antonio by imbuing it with a critical outlook on social phenomena, particularly on the harsh conditions obtaining in the Philippines.

Wielding metaphor, sound, sight, and insight together, Antonio succeeds in creating portraits of a social milieu wracked by violence, absurdity, repression, and resistance.

In poems formed from rural experience, poverty is unrelieved and life is a heavy burden to bear, with the poet assuming the role of a persona who interrogates, narrates, participates in the unfolding narrative, or who criticizes the social phenomenon that has brought about the condition of oppression. Sardonic humor is present as poetic device in evoking tragicomic characters, such as Mariang Beha, Islaw Palitaw, and Pedro Penduko.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modernist techniques are apparent in Antonio&rsquo;s metaphorical addresses about love, birthing, dying, nature, and life in the city and countryside. But what endows his poems with lyricism and expressiveness is the poet&rsquo;s view of the world as deeply flawed, but worthy and needing of change.

Like most Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, the hudhud is performed during communal affairs, such as wedding feasts and wakes, but it is most often performed during harvest. Hudhud literally means &ldquo;harvest-song.&rdquo; In contrast to most Philippine epics, which are chanted, the hudhud is sung. Traditionally, only women can sing the epic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are legends surrounding the practice. Some folks believe that while a group of women were singing about the adventures of the hero Pumbakhayon one harvest season, he appeared to them and taught them to sing new hudhud, revolving around other characters such as Aliguyon and Bugan. At dusk he disappeared, and all those who saw him died. Two female harvesters who heard but did not see him survived to spread the new hudhud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Different hudhud have been transcribed, but they all deal with the hero Aliguyon and his kin. In 1902, an unknown <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a> transcribed a hudhud as it was recited by Leon Kutug in Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya. William Beyer recorded about 40 songs, but to date, these have not been transcribed. Rufino Chungalao transcribed and translated &ldquo;Bugan Inaliguyon&rdquo; (Bugan, Wife of Aliguyon) in 1950 but has not published it yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fr Francis Lambrecht, CICM, is the most prolific transcriber of the hudhud. He transcribed four hudhud from the 1930s to the 1950s. In the 1960s, he transcribed two hudhud: <b><i>Hudhud of</i></b> <b><i>Aliguyon Who Was Bored by the Rustle</i></b> <b><i>of</i></b> <b><i>the Palm Tree at Aladugan </i></b>and <b><i>Hudhud of</i></b> <b><i>Bugan with</i></b> <b><i>Whom the</i></b> <b><i>Ravens Flew</i></b> <b><i>Away at Gonhadan</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lambrecht&rsquo;s source for <b><i>Hudhud of</i></b> <b><i>Aliguyon Who Was Bored </i></b>was Margarita B. Gimbatan, a native of Lagawe. Lambrecht was assisted by Fr Emiliano Madangeng, a native of Hapao. In this hudhud, Aliguyon, disguised as an old man, wins himself a wife. Bored by the rustle of the leaves of the palm tree in their yard, Aliguyon informs his mother that he will journey to neighboring villages. He meets an old man who offers him betel to chew. The old man asks to be slain. Aliguyon kills him, dries the old man&rsquo;s skin in the sun, and wears it. Disguised as an old man, he reaches Tulaling where lives Bugan, a beautiful maiden who pities him and feeds him warm cooked rice. Bugan bejewels herself and goes to Makawayan, where she is well received. There, she dances with Dadyaahon and drinks rice wine with him. When she comes home tipsy, she pines for him. A month and a half pass, and Bugan visits another village. Aliguyon disguises himself as Intuliktik, the wife of Dadyaahon. Bugan dances with Aliguyon, who is in disguise, and drinks rice wine with him. At sundown, Bugan returns home, still pining for Dadyaahon. Aliguyon, still disguised, goes to Bugan&rsquo;s mother and proposes that she hold a feast to attract boys from neighboring villages. During the feast, Pinayudan seems to be the best match for Bugan, but Aliguyon, as an old man, wrestles with Pinayudan and unmasks himself. His disguise&mdash;the old man&rsquo;s skin&mdash;is torn apart. Bugan and Aliguyon are married. After the wedding feast, Aliguyon returns to his village with Bugan. He learns that his mother felled the palm tree in their yard some time ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Hudhud</i></b><i> <b>of</b> <b>Bugan with</b> <b>Whom</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ravens</b> <b>Flew</b> <b>Away</b> <b>at</b> <b>Gonhadan</b> </i>is another story of Aliguyon&rsquo;s romance with Bugan. After feeding the chicken and pigs, Indangunay goes to the granaries while carrying her daughter Bugan in a blanket, which she slings on her back. She opens the 10th <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">granary</a> and lets Bugan down. While they are eating, ravens snatch Bugan and drop her on the crest of a mountain at Habungan. An older girl Indamolnay discovers Bugan and rears her, both of them feeding on guava fruit and berries. When they look down at the rice fields of Hananga, they yearn for rice. Indamolnay leaves Bugan in their house and goes down to Hananga to help the harvesters. At noon, the harvesters are told to carry bundles of rice to the granary pavement and to eat. Indamolnay hides a part of her share in her sleeve for Bugan. Malinayu, who divides the shares at the close of the day, gives but two bundles to Indamolnay, who carries the rice up to the mountain crest. Chickens and pigs meet her and eat the grains of rice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The same events happen over the next two days. On the fourth day, Bugan wants to go with Indamolnay, but Indamolnay advises against it. Stubborn, Bugan later goes out alone and picks droppings of rice ears. Rice carriers and other boys see her and inform Aliguyon, who looks for her. When he finds her, he tells her to come with him. She refuses at first but later consents. Arriving at Hananga, she introduces Indamolnay to Aliguyon. Aliguyon disposes of his wife and decides to marry Bugan. Indangunay hears of the wedding and, wondering whether Bugan is her lost daughter, goes to Hananga. Mother and daughter are reunited. Indangunay recounts how she lost Bugan. She then fetches Pangaiwan, her husband. The epic ends with a double wedding at the house of Indangunay and Pangaiwan: Aliguyon marries Bugan, and Indamolnay marries Daulayan, Bugan&rsquo;s brother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Besides Lambrecht, the fictionist Amador Daguio also studied the hudhud. For his thesis at Stanford University, he wrote an English translation of one sung by Hinayup Bantayan of Burnay and transcribed in Ifugao prose by Pio B. Abdul. Called <b><i>Hudhud</i></b><i> <b>hi Aliguyon</b> </i>(Hudhud of Aliguyon), Hinayup Bantayan&rsquo;s version centers on the feud between two heroes, Pumbakhayon and Aliguyon, and their eventual friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aliguyon of Hananga gathers friends of his age to play tops with them. Forcefully, he throws his top, which bounds across the yard and spins inside his house, hitting his father&rsquo;s <i>bangiban</i>,<i> </i>a piece of wood shaped like a boomerang. He goes up the house to look for his top. Not locating it, he picks up the bangiban and throws it away. Aliguyon brings a rooster down the house and calls his friends to watch what it will foretell about his plan to fight the Daligdigan, enemies of the Hananga. When the rooster augurs success, Aliguyon summons his comrades to camp at the yard, despite his mother&rsquo;s protestations. The next day, he asks his father for the whereabouts of the <i>idao</i>,<i> </i>a bird of augury. His father counsels him against battling the Daligdigan and suggests that he bring home a woman instead, but to no avail. His father tests Aliguyon&rsquo;s skill by throwing a spear at him. Aliguyon catches it very easily. He and his comrades proceed to Daligdigan, the chirping of the idao<i> </i>bird strengthening him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon reaching Daligdigan, Aliguyon challenges the Daligdigan led by Pumbakhayon, who responds that, as his men have not eaten yet, Aliguyon must wait. Pumbakhayon takes a rooster and opens it up to consult its bile sac for a sign. It foretells good luck. Calling all his men, he tells them to shake the soot from their shields. When the Hananga warriors hear the beating of the shields, they think of retreating, but Aliguyon assures them that their enemies are only cleaning their shields. Pumbakhayon crosses the village and comes to the rice path where Aliguyon meets him. Not wanting to fight in the rice fields and spoil their harvest, Pumbakhayon invites Aliguyon to fight him on the riverbed. Aliguyon refuses; he shall fight Pumbakhayon in the fields until bamboo and <i>alimit</i> trees grow there. The duel starts after sunrise and continues till noon. From a distance, the women of Daligdigan cheer for Pumbakhayon, but he tells them that Aliguyon is his equal in battle. Dangunay, Pumbakhayon&rsquo;s mother, arrives at the scene of the battle, bringing her baby daughter Bugan with her. Aliguyon notices them. Dangunay raises a bolo to stop the fight so that Pumbakhayon may eat. Aliguyon returns to his camp and eats. After the meal, Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon resume the combat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The seesaw battle lasts for a year and a half, pausing at evenings and at mealtimes. One day, Aliguyon notices that bamboo and alimit trees have grown on the rice terraces. He tells Pumbakhayon that he will return home, but Pumbakhayon says he shall come after Aliguyon afterward. When Aliguyon and his comrades reach Hananga at night, he asks his mother why the rice has not yet been harvested. Dumulaw, his mother, replies that they have enough rice on reserve. When dawn breaks, Aliguyon tells his comrades to hold a feast. Then he heads for the riverbank to meet Pumbakhayon. Aliguyon wants to save Hananga&rsquo;s harvest by fighting at the riverbank. Pumbakhayon sees the harvesters of Hananga and angrily spears Aliguyon&rsquo;s companions. He makes his way to the rice fields where Aliguyon fights him. Aliguyon&rsquo;s companions root for him, but Aliguyon tells them that Pumbakhayon is an equal and worthy opponent. Worried, Dumilaw goes to the ricefields with her daughter Aginaya. She breaks the fight so that Aliguyon may eat. Pumbakhayon notices Dumulaw and Aginaya, and asks Aliguyon about them. Out of respect, Pumbakhayon allows Aliguyon to eat. Afterward, the two chew betel nut. The battle resumes, the opponents hurling one spear between them. Their companions join in the fight, which lasts for another year and a half, with neither side victorious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Pumbakhayon notices that bamboo and alimit trees have grown on the terraces, he and his forces withdraw. Aliguyon says he shall follow them to Daligdigan. The next day, Aliguyon and his comrades leave Hananga for Daligdigan, where another protracted battle happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rumors of Pumbakhayon&rsquo;s death reach the neighboring villages. Daulayan, who has been betrothed to Pumbakhayon&rsquo;s sister, decides to fight for Pumbakhayon despite his mother Maggapid&rsquo;s warning. When he arrives at the scene of the battle, he finds Pumbakhayon alive, trading spear throws with Aliguyon. Daulayan says that he will take Pumbakhayon&rsquo;s place and explains that they will become brothers-in-law, for his mother Maggapid and Pumbakhayon&rsquo;s mother Dangunay have exchanged beads. Pumbakhayon advises him against fighting Aliguyon, but Daulayan is insistent. With a spear, Aliguyon wounds Daulayan. As he is about to be beheaded, Daulayan begs for mercy and offers Aliguyon all his beads in exchange for his life. Aliguyon spares him, but Pumbakhayon has been so shamed that he rejects Daulayan as his kin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Instead, he thinks Aliguyon will make a better brother-in-law than Daulayan. Daulayan returns home to his unsympathetic mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The two warriors Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon make peace. Pangaiwan, Pumbakhayon&rsquo;s father, divides a betel nut between them and offers each a cup of wine. The next morning, Aliguyon woos Bugan and takes Bugan to Hananga where they celebrate the wedding. In turn, Pumbakhayon marries Aginaya, Aliguyon&rsquo;s sister. He brings her to Daligdigan where they enjoy a life of renown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic is structurally symmetrical. It opens with something comparable to an invocation, the rooster prayer. The first major episode, Aliguyon&rsquo;s invasion of Daligdigan, follows. The action subsides with the arrival of the mother and daughter. The second major episode, Pumbakhayon&rsquo;s invasion of Hananga, parallels the first major episode, and, as with the first part, it is the female figures who break the battle. The epic ends with another rooster prayer, giving it a sense of closure and balance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Parallelisms in the details of the two episodes can be established. Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon, for example, describe each other in almost identical terms. The description of the battle fields in either episode is also similar. The repetitions climax in the resolution of the epic, a double wedding between members of opposing tribes, which, according to Josefina Mariano, 1983, in an introduction to the hudhud, leads readers to the theme of the epic: self-preservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like many other epics, <b><i>Hudhud</i></b><i> <b>hi</b> <b>Aliguyon</b> </i>presents much of the culture of the people it comes from. Fighting by trading spear shots, consulting the rooster&rsquo;s bile sac for signs, and chewing betel nut are often depicted in the epic. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5493\">E.

Pumbakhayon advises him against fighting Aliguyon, but Daulayan is insistent. With a spear, Aliguyon wounds Daulayan. As he is about to be beheaded, Daulayan begs for mercy and offers Aliguyon all his beads in exchange for his life. Aliguyon spares him, but Pumbakhayon has been so shamed that he rejects Daulayan as his kin."

The next morning, Aliguyon woos Bugan and takes Bugan to Hananga where they celebrate the wedding. In turn, Pumbakhayon marries Aginaya, Aliguyon&#x2019;s sister. He brings her to Daligdigan where they enjoy a life of renown."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The epic is structurally symmetrical. It opens with something comparable to an invocation, the rooster prayer. The first major episode, Aliguyon&#x2019;s invasion of Daligdigan, follows. The action subsides with the arrival of the mother and daughter. The second major episode, Pumbakhayon&#x2019;s invasion of Hananga, parallels the first major episode, and, as with the first part, it is the female figures who break the battle. The epic ends with another rooster prayer, giving it a sense of closure and balance."

				"value": "Parallelisms in the details of the two episodes can be established. Aliguyon and Pumbakhayon, for example, describe each other in almost identical terms. The description of the battle fields in either episode is also similar. The repetitions climax in the resolution of the epic, a double wedding between members of opposing tribes, which, according to Josefina Mariano, 1983, in an introduction to the hudhud, leads readers to the theme of the epic: self-preservation."

Transcriber, Gina Barte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This entry on the epic of Humadapnon comes from four different sources: two books edited by F. Landa Jocano, a typescript also by F. Landa Jocano, and a typescript by Gina Barte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Humadapnon</i></b> is one of two cycles of the oldest known epic of Panay, <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b>, which belongs to the oral tradition of the Sulod mountain people living near the headwaters of the rivers Jalaur (or Halawod), Aklan, and Antique. The other cycle is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></a></i></b>. It is sung in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2358\">Karay-a</a>, which is the language of the Sulod. Each of the two cycles is generally considered an epic in its own right, and each centers on one of the two heroes: Labaw Donggon and Humadapnon, although in the Humadapnon cycle, Dumalapdap becomes an equally important figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Tarangban I</i></b>, 2000, is divided into four <b>sugidanon</b> (narrations): <i>pangayaw</i> (travel), <i>tarangban</i> (cave), <i>bihag</i> (captivity), and <i>pagbawi</i> (rescue). The <b>pahunawa</b> (introduction) presents Humadapnon as the world&rsquo;s pillar and strength, a great leader and counselor in the realm of Pan-ay. The epic action begins with Humadapnon realizing that it is time for him to find someone to marry, and she must be equal to his stature and ability. His spirit friends, Taghuy and Duwindi, confirm that such a maiden is Nagmalitong Yawa, daughter of Buyong Labaw Donggon and Uwa Matan-ayon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Humadapnon asks his sister Uwa Labing-Anyag to create a man to assist him in his search for Nagmalitong Yawa. Labing-Anyag creates a man with the following elements: drops of blood taken from Humadapnon, their parents Ginbitinan and Burulakaw, and herself; <i>ginhawa</i> (the breath of existence); <i>domdom</i> (reason); <i>tingug</i> (voice); and <i>bo-ot</i> (conscience). The new man, who is also Humadapnon&rsquo;s brother, springs to life full grown. They name him Dumalapdap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After much training and preparation, the two brothers, with their <i>uripon </i>(helpers), set out on a golden boat to the mouth of the Halawod River. The journey is fraught with various trials. Humadapnon and Dumalapdap barely escape being crushed between two boulders colliding with one another. Thereafter, the golden boat traverses a sea where the water is sticky and the foam is like human blood. Their first stop is the promontory of their uncle, Buyong Sarandihon, to whom Humadapnon pays his respects. Buyong Sarandihon warns Humadapnon away from the enchanted and fearful island cave of Tarangban.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thousands of <i>binukot</i> (well-kept maidens) inhabit Tarangban, which is headed by the most beautiful of them all, Sinagkating Bulawan. She is strolling on the beach when Humadapnon&rsquo;s golden boat sails by. She calls to the travelers to drop in and chew some betel nut. Mindful of their mission, Dumalapdap ignores her, and Humadapnon respectfully declines, though he promises to stop on his return journey. Sinagkating Bulawan insists but Humadapnon declines again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Malubay Hanginon, Sinagkating Bulawan&rsquo;s youngest sister, lives in the seventh room of Tarangban, out of anyone&rsquo;s sight, where she weaves fabric from threads of gold. After Sinagkating Bulawan tells her of Humadapnon&rsquo;s snub, she puts on her best garments and all her jewelry. At the cave entrance where &ldquo;millions, thousands, and hundreds&rdquo; of well-kept maidens have gathered, Malubay Hanginon gracefully walks to the center and asks Humadapnon to stay for a visit. Despite her persistence, Humadapnon refuses. Malubay Hanginon, through her spirit friends, casts a powerful spell on Humadapnon. He loses his reason, will, and judgment. Over Dumalapdap&rsquo;s protests, Humadapnon enters the Tarangban. At first, Dumalapdap stays on the golden boat but soon takes his spear and shield and looks for Humadapnon inside the cave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Inside the Tarangban, the other well-kept maidens welcome Humadapnon. Lying on a hammock made of cloth of many colors, Humadapnon caresses and makes love to the well-kept maidens. He is deaf to Dumalapdap&rsquo;s pleas for them to resume their journey and finds Malubay Hanginon on a hammock in the seventh room. He apologizes to her and joins her in the hammock. In frustration, Dumalapdap shouts and calls for Humadapnon, who finally bids Malubay Hanginon farewell. She is enraged but Humadapnon casts a sleeping spell on her. Before he can reach his boat, Malubay Hanginon awakens, bewitches him again and imprisons him in the cave. At Humadapnon&rsquo;s bidding, Dumalapdap returns to Pan-ay to get help from their parents, Burulakaw and Ginbitinan, and to call on their people to free him. Any man who would succeed would be rewarded pots of silver and gold. If his rescuer were to be a maiden, Humadapnon would offer her his hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hangin Hugayong, the wind, flies Burulakaw and Ginbitinan to Tarangban to free Humadapnon but they are unable to. Neither can all the powerful babaylan (shaman) throughout the land. Humadapnon&rsquo;s two spirit friends, Taghuy and Duwindi, tell Dumalapdap of the one maiden who can match the powers of the binukot of Tarangban. She is Nagmalitong Yawa, who is also the lady whom Humadapnon wishes to marry. Dumalapdap, borne by Hangin Hugayong, flies to her island. Knowing that she will probably refuse to rescue Humadapnon, who means nothing to her, Dumalapdap tells Nagmalitong Yawa that it is her brother Buyong Ginlawudan who is imprisoned in the Tarangban. As they are flying to Tarangban, Hangin Hugayong confesses the truth to Nagmalitong Yawa, who, aggrieved, returns to her kingdom. Taghuy, Duwindi, and Hangin Hugayong, with the help of Nagmalitong Yawa&rsquo;s musical instruments, the <i>bidya</i> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>) and <i>kudyapi </i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">lute</a>),<i> </i>again<i> </i>entreat her to rescue Humadapnon.<i> </i>She grudgingly relents but only on the condition that she would transform into a man. She assumes the name of Buyong Sunmasakay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sunmasakay lands at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/233\">cave</a>&rsquo;s door, which the people are still trying to open. He uses his <i>pamlang</i> (psychic powers) to strike it open with the <i>dalugdug</i> (thunder). The well-kept maidens are thus exposed, and their leader, Sinagkating Bulawan, engages in a terrible battle with Buyong Sunmasakay. All the well-kept maidens of Tarangban are killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the seventh room, Buyong Sunmasakay comes upon Malubay Hanginon, and they fight. Malubay Hanginon seeks help from Humadapnon, who gives it because he is still bewitched. In the end, Buyong Sunmasakay&rsquo;s pamlang overpowers those of Malubay Hanginon and Humadapnon, and he frees Humadapnon from the cave. Father Burulakaw, Mother Ginbitinan, Buyong Dumalapdap, and their subjects from Pan-ay dance with joy. However, Humadapnon remains in a trance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sunmasakay prepares for home but is persuaded to stay to awaken Humadapnon. Sunmasakay sends his spirit friends to the <i>urugan</i> (the highest point in the sky) to fetch the water of life and happiness. He conducts a ritual that breaks the spell on Humadapnon. Sunmasakay bids farewell and requests Humadapnon&rsquo;s parents and brother not to reveal his real identity to him. He transforms himself back into Nagmalitong Yawa and walks through the admiring crowd to where her stone <i>binanugan</i> (hawk&rsquo;s resting place) waits. She sits on it and crosses her legs as everyone leaves her content in her solitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In<b><i> Tarangban II</i></b>, Humadapnon must recapture the heirloom <i>biday</i> (boat), named Timpara Alimuon, as a requisite to winning the approval of Nagmalitung Yawa&rsquo;s parents for her hand in marriage. Nagmalitung Yawa agrees to accompany him on the sea voyage on condition that he never forces himself on her. In the course of their journey, Humadapnon politely refuses Balanakon&rsquo;s invitation to drop by, resists the challenge to fight Dampig Piliw with the help of Nagmalitung Yawa&rsquo;s magic charms, sails by the place of the dead, and reaches Paglambuhan&rsquo;s fortress. It is Paglambuhan who keeps Timpara Alimuon in his fortress and is thus the person that Humadapnon must fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Throughout the voyage, Humadapnon has tried to seduce Nagmalitong Yawa, to no avail. But as he prepares for battle with Paglambuhan, Nagmalitong Yawa relents and allows some foreplay. She soon stops him, promising that they would resume their lovemaking after he kills Paglambuhan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first battle is between Dumalapdap and Paglambuhan&rsquo;s son, Sumagulung, who is killed by Dumalapdap. The next battle is between the enraged Paglambuhan and Humadapnon, and it lasts for months until Humadapnon weakens. He flies up to the goddess, Ulang Santunilyu, who gives him more courage, strength, and charm. The duel resumes, but it appears that it will last indefinitely until Nagmalitong Yawa distracts Paglambuhan with her fragrance. Humadapnon kills him. The victors now journey back to Halawod, with the heads of the two enemies displayed on the biday&rsquo;s stern. Humadapnon again tries to make love to Nagmalitong Yawa. She reminds him of the warrior&rsquo;s code requiring the victor to bed the dead enemy&rsquo;s widow. Humadapnon accedes, but when he stays more than an hour with the widow, Nagmalitong Yawa leaves him, manning the biday herself. Dumalapdap shouts for Humadapnon, and Hangin flies Humadapnon back to the biday on his shield.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The journey resumes but tension prevails between the two epic heroes. As the biday nears Halawod, Nagmalitong Yawa puts everyone to sleep, covers the biday with a shield of invisibility, and flies back to Halawod. In Halawod, Humadapnon and Dumalapdap meet Nagmalitong Yawa&rsquo;s parents, Labaw Donggon and Matan-ayon. Their own parents, Burulakaw and Ginbitinan, arrive for the patingog, which is the grand feast for a marriage proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dumalapdap falls in love with Sibyang Alon, who is forbidden to him because she is a goddess. After the wedding, Humadapnon leaves Nagmalitong Yawa to accompany Dumalapdap on a journey for Huyung Adlaw&rsquo;s hand in marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Paglambuhan and Sumagulung, who have come back to life, tell Matan-ayon that Humadapnon is dead. Matan-ayon compels the reluctant Nagmalitong Yawa to marry Sumagulung by making her pregnant. Humadapnon returns to Halawod and kills Sumagulung, Paglambuhan, and Nagmalitong Yawa. The grieving Humadapnon returns to Panay. At Humadapnon&rsquo;s remorseful pleading, Labing Anyag brings Nagmalitong Yawa back to life by endowing her with the breath of life, strength of existence, conscience, feelings, intelligence, and compassion. After some resistance, she agrees to return to Humadapnon. Humadapnon receives Labaw Donggon and Matan-ayon&rsquo;s blessing. Labing Anyag returns to Ginlawudan. The epic ends as Humadapnon and Namaglitong Yawa enter their chamber and close the door behind them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Ulang Udig&ndash;Jocano typescript version, Humadapnon is chieftain of the Sulod people and has two brothers: Labaw Donggon and Dumalapdap. He embarks on a journey fraught with trials as he seeks Nagmalitong Yawa, whom he wants for a wife. The rest of the epic recounts how he wins, loses, and again wins Nagmalitong Yawa. These events happen at seven-year intervals, during which he must pass a series of trials. Dumalapdap, his brother, is instrumental in Humadapnon&rsquo;s first separation from Nagmalitong Yawa, but they also fight shoulder to shoulder at a wedding feast where Nagmalitong Yawa is about to be wed to another man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Barte version, Humadapnon and Dumalapdap are nephews instead of brother to Labaw Donggon, who is a first-generation hero. Humadapnon plays a less aggressive role than his brother Dumalapdap and his wife Nagmalitong Yawa. Here, she takes on a central role as her husband&rsquo;s rescuer and as mediator in conflicts between the two brothers. In one instance, she engages his enemies in a hand-to-hand combat. Barte&rsquo;s version of the Humadapnon cycle follows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Humadapnon dreams of a beautiful woman named Tubigon Daligan-Umis Kuyam-isan, a binukot, who lives in a golden tower surrounded with bamboo thickets. He wakens with the resolve to search for this woman to marry her. His mother Anggoy Imbitinan protests that there are numerous binukot in their own village; but he is adamant, and he prepares for a 10-year journey. Shortly before he leaves, Dumalapdap, his younger brother, is born and insists on accompanying Humadapnon. The brothers anoint their vessel with herbs. From their home at Halawod River, they sail to other places, frequently beset by difficulties, which Dumalapdap overcomes. They reach the river Mabkad, ruled by two datus named Mamang Mangalayo, the prince, and Mamang Dumadakung Dagat, the supreme ruler. Mangalayo occupies the upstream portion, while Dumadakung Dagat occupies the portion at the mouth of the river. The datus block Humadapnon and Dumalapdap&rsquo;s sailing course. Dumalapdap and Humadapnon introduce themselves as the offspring of Harong Buruwisan, the supreme deity of the seventh layer of the skies, and Anggoy Imbitinan. The two datus, on the other hand, reveal that they are descendants of Pagbuaya, the ruler of the underworld. A battle ensues between the datus when Mangalayo learns that Humadapnon plans to get a binukot. They fight for days, and Humadapnon wins. Mangalayo begs for his life and promises not to block the brothers&rsquo; way again. Dumadakang Dagat then engages Humadapnon in a battle in the air, which lasts for several days. Weakened, Humadapnon asks for water from Banogon, the eagle who is his constant companion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dumalapdap, left on earth, sees his brother weakening and flies to his rescue. Meanwhile, along the shores of the river Makutay-kutay, Abyang Baranogon and his younger brother Padanong Palinti are having a drink. They are the sons of Labaw Donggon and cousins of Humadapnon and Dumalapdap. Pandanong Palinti goes down to the river to catch fish only to find it overflowing with blood. When he casts his net, he catches a stranger&rsquo;s head. He rushes to his brother to recount the incident. Thinking that their cousins are in trouble, the brothers rush to the scene of the battle. Baranogon takes Dumalapdap&rsquo;s place against Dumadakung Dagat. With the help of their ancestors in heaven, Baranogon defeats Dumadakung Dagat. Having killed Dumadakung Dagat, Baranogon asks Dumalapdap to give him Tubigan Daligan, Dumadakung Dagat&rsquo;s binukot, in exchange for his sister Malitong Yawa. Dumalapdap refers Baranogon to Humadapnon, who consents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Dumalapdap decides to go on his own journey. Humadapnon refuses to accompany him, for he has not yet met his binukot. Dumalapdap goes to the house of Mamang Tumpong Langit, the ruler of the river Mabun-ag. Finding him asleep, Dumalapdap casts a spell over him to make him go on sleeping and enters the room of the binukot Huyohuyong Adlaw. When Tumpong Langit discovers that his binukot has been stolen, he appeals to his brothers for help. He challenges Dumalapdap to a combat, which lasts for many days and nights.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Meanwhile, Baronogon and Padanog Palinti reach the river Maragkot where Abyang Mangalayo, whom Humadapnon defeated, blocks their path. Baranogon and Mangalayo fight, but this time Mangalayo&rsquo;s life is not spared. Baranogon claims Mangalayo&rsquo;s binukot but refrains from laying a hand on her, because he still has great obligations to meet. The two datus reach the place of Abyang Lumbanglantang at Mabun-ag river. There they threaten to kill Lumbanglantang if he does not give them his binukot Labi-labing Anyang. Fearing for his life, Lumbanglantang does not resist the datus. Later, the datus reach the river Baliwagan, where they demand the binukot Layalayang Sukla. Abyang Sumagorong gives her up without a fight. However, Sumagorong journeys to win the hand of Malitong Yawa, Baranogon&rsquo;s sister. By the time Baranogon returns to his place, Sumagorong has already offered his bridal gifts. Realizing that Sumagorong may have gained an edge over Humadapnon in winning his sister&rsquo;s hand, Baranogon makes a copy of Malitong Yawa shaped out of dough made from powdered rice. He then instructs his sister to go to Humadapnon&rsquo;s younger sister at the Halawod River. The following day, Humadapnon presents his suit for the hand of Malitong Yawa. Malitong Yawa&rsquo;s mother Matanayon favors Sumagorong. However, as Sumagorong and the replica are spending their honeymoon, Baranogon tells Humadapnon that the real Malitong Yawa is still his. Meanwhile, Dumalapdap weakens in his battle with Mamang Tumpong Langit. He sends a messenger to inform Humadapnon about his plight. Humadapnon rushes to his aid and takes his place, but it is the ancestors who again settle the match. Dumalapdap expresses his gratitude and tells Baronogon that on his way he has seen Labaw Donggon, Baronogon&rsquo;s father, being kept a prisoner by Mamang Magtangub, a malignant spirit residing in the mountain caves. Dumalapdap, Humadapnon, and Baranogon head for Magtangub&rsquo;s mountain fortress to free Labaw Donggon, only to find him a heap of bones. Baranogon demands that Magtangub return his father to life. Revived, Labaw Donggon engages Magtangub in a combat that lasts for many days. Labaw Donggon triumphs with the help of his ancestors. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The datus sail home. On their way, however, they pass by caves inhabited by enchanted spirits. Humadapnon is seduced and decides to stay awhile. He is bewitched and imprisoned by the spirits. Dumalapdap asks for help from his mother, Anggoy Imbitinan, to rescue Humadapnon. All the binukot respond to the call for help, but Malitong Yawa alone succeeds in opening the cave&rsquo;s stone door. Malitong Yawa kills all the spirits with her bolo.

From their home at Halawod River, they sail to other places, frequently beset by difficulties, which Dumalapdap overcomes. They reach the river Mabkad, ruled by two datus named Mamang Mangalayo, the prince, and Mamang Dumadakung Dagat, the supreme ruler. Mangalayo occupies the upstream portion, while Dumadakung Dagat occupies the portion at the mouth of the river. The datus block Humadapnon and Dumalapdap&#x2019;s sailing course.

The two datus reach the place of Abyang Lumbanglantang at Mabun-ag river. There they threaten to kill Lumbanglantang if he does not give them his binukot Labi-labing Anyang. Fearing for his life, Lumbanglantang does not resist the datus. Later, the datus reach the river Baliwagan, where they demand the binukot Layalayang Sukla. Abyang Sumagorong gives her up without a fight. However, Sumagorong journeys to win the hand of Malitong Yawa, Baranogon&#x2019;s sister. By the time Baranogon returns to his place, Sumagorong has already offered his bridal gifts. Realizing that Sumagorong may have gained an edge over Humadapnon in winning his sister&#x2019;s hand, Baranogon makes a copy of Malitong Yawa shaped out of dough made from powdered rice. He then instructs his sister to go to Humadapnon&#x2019;s younger sister at the Halawod River. The following day, Humadapnon presents his suit for the hand of Malitong Yawa. Malitong Yawa&#x2019;s mother Matanayon favors Sumagorong. However, as Sumagorong and the replica are spending their honeymoon, Baranogon tells Humadapnon that the real Malitong Yawa is still his. Meanwhile, Dumalapdap weakens in his battle with Mamang Tumpong Langit. He sends a messenger to inform Humadapnon about his plight. Humadapnon rushes to his aid and takes his place, but it is the ancestors who again settle the match. Dumalapdap expresses his gratitude and tells Baronogon that on his way he has seen Labaw Donggon, Baronogon&#x2019;s father, being kept a prisoner by Mamang Magtangub, a malignant spirit residing in the mountain caves. Dumalapdap, Humadapnon, and Baranogon head for Magtangub&#x2019;s mountain fortress to free Labaw Donggon, only to find him a heap of bones. Baranogon demands that Magtangub return his father to life. Revived, Labaw Donggon engages Magtangub in a combat that lasts for many days.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5603\">Allan Popa</a>. Quezon City: Artista Publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 43 poems in this collection deal with mortality, transcendence, and loss of innocence, framed in dramatic situations. Many are set in Catanduanes, Popa&rsquo;s birthplace. Some foreground rituals and events rooted in Catholicism and call for knowledge of local space, folklore, and religion for their proper understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The opening poem, &ldquo;Signos&rdquo; (Sign), introduces the theme of human vulnerability to external and internal crises using the storm as a symbol. The threat that a storm poses is magnified further by the poem&rsquo;s likening it to an eagle about to snatch an unsuspecting prey. Layered and complex symbols are common to the poems and are of a piece with the motif of change or metamorphosis that runs through the collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Poems about the connection between death and resurrection follow, three of which are &ldquo;Lazaro&rdquo; (Lazarus), &ldquo;Tinatawag Minsan na Rosas ang Sugat sa Tagiliran ni Kristo&rdquo; (The Wound on the Side of Christ Is Sometimes Called a Rose), and &ldquo;La Muwerte&rdquo; (Death). The first poem dramatizes the moment of Lazarus&rsquo;s resurrection and emphasizes the irony that Christ, who performs the miracle, will himself confront death soon.

The threat that a storm poses is magnified further by the poem&#x2019;s likening it to an eagle about to snatch an unsuspecting prey. Layered and complex symbols are common to the poems and are of a piece with the motif of change or metamorphosis that runs through the collection."

The first poem dramatizes the moment of Lazarus&#x2019;s resurrection and emphasizes the irony that Christ, who performs the miracle, will himself confront death soon.

Only the roselike wound on his side, the poem proposes, enables him finally to break free and rise to heaven&#x2019;s light and to eternity.

One night the king dreams that his youngest son, his favorite, is killed treacherously and then thrown into a deep well. This dream grieves the king so much he falls ill. One doctor tells the king that only the singing of the Adarna bird can cure him. This bird can be found on Mount Tabor and perches on a tree called Piedras Platas. The eldest brother sets out to look for this magic bird but after three months&rsquo; wandering, his horse falls from exhaustion after the steep climb to Mount Tabor. He finds the tree and keeps watch by it. At midnight the bird comes. It molts and its feathers change to a beautiful color. Then it sings so sweetly that the weary prince, reclining on the tree trunk, falls asleep. The bird sings seven times, its feathers changing color before each song. After singing, the bird defecates, and its droppings fall on the prince, who turns to stone. The second prince follows a year later, but the same fate befalls him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Only the kind and pious youngest son Don Juan, who is also the king&rsquo;s favorite, succeeds in catching the Adarna bird because he passes the test of kindness set upon him by a leper, who turns out to be a hermit. This old man instructs him on how to remain awake during the singing of the bird. He gave Juan seven calamansi and a razor blade. Juan is to cut himself and squeeze some calamansi juice to the wound every time the bird sings. He is to avoid having the bird&rsquo;s droppings fall on him so that he will not turn to stone. The hermit then gives Juan a golden strap with which to tie the bird after he catches it. Juan does as the hermit instructs, and he is successful. The hermit further instructs him to pour water on the two slabs of stone lying under the tree, and the stones come to life as Don Pedro and Don Diego.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the three brothers journey home, the two older brothers fall upon Juan and leave him almost dead by the roadside. When they reach home, the bird refuses to sing and loses its feathers. The king becomes even more ill. Meanwhile, Juan is cured by an old man who sends him home after telling him that his father is still sick. When Don Juan arrives home, the bird sings and the king gets well. The two older brothers are saved from punishment by Juan who pleads clemency for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The king charges his three sons with the guarding of the bird. Once more, the older brothers plot against Juan. They release the bird when it is Juan&rsquo;s turn to guard it. Juan is so afraid of his father&rsquo;s wrath that he sets out to look for the bird. When the king discovers the loss of the bird, he sends out his two older sons to look for Juan. They find Juan in the mountain of Armenia and decide to stay there with him. One day the three brothers discover a well with a long rope lying beside it. They decide to descend into the well to explore it. Only Don Juan reaches the bottom and discovers another world there. He rescues two captive princesses: Do&ntilde;a Juana from a giant, and her sister Do&ntilde;a Leonora from a seven-headed serpent. Don Pedro and Don Diego pull the three of them up. When they are about to go, Leonora discovers that she has left her ring below. Don Juan goes back for it but Don Pedro, who has fallen in love with Leonora, cuts the rope to the well. The grieving Leonora releases her pet wolf to look for Juan and heal him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Berbania, the two brothers fabricate a story of how they never found Juan but instead rescued two princesses. Don Diego and Juana are married, but Leonora asks for a delay of seven years on the pretext that she has to fulfill a vow. Meanwhile, the magic wolf finds Juan and heals him. With the aid of Leonora&rsquo;s ring, the wolf, and the Blessed Virgin, Juan is able to get out of the well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He rests under a tree, on which the Adarna bird alights and sings to him of Princess Maria, lovelier than Princess Leonora and the youngest daughter of King Salermo of the kingdom of Crystal. He sets out to find her and is helped first by an old man who feeds him wondrous food and then instructs him to go to the seventh mountain. The old man also hands him a piece of garment. Two hermits in succession, each older than the preceding one, recognize the piece of cloth as a remnant of Jesus&rsquo;s clothing. Each summons the animals in his dominion to inquire about the kingdom of Crystal but no animal can help, until an eagle, arriving late, remarks that he has just come from the kingdom of Crystal. The eagle flies Juan there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Juan is instructed by the eagle to hide near the princesses&rsquo; bathrooms. They soon arrive, dressed in dove feathers. After they have been undressed and entered their respective bathrooms, Juan takes Maria&rsquo;s feathers. He succeeds in winning Maria&rsquo;s love, but she points to piles of stones surrounding the palace, telling him that they are suitors whom her father has defeated and enchanted. She instructs him on how he is to deal with her father. The king gives Juan seven impossible tasks, all of which Maria, by the power of her white magic, actually performs. When the king decides to have Juan killed by his brother in England, Maria suggests that she and Juan flee to Berbania. They are pursued by the king, but Maria throws objects, which become obstacles. The couple escapes, but the father puts a curse on Maria so that Juan will not remember her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sure enough, when Juan leaves Maria outside the city to get a carriage, he forgets her. Preparations are made for Juan&rsquo;s wedding to Leonora. Maria, however, arrives on the day of the wedding and tries to reawaken Juan&rsquo;s memory by means of two Negro puppets who are made to converse and dance. Juan finally remembers Maria. Both Maria and Leonora lay claim on him. After much debate, Leonora is persuaded to marry Don Pedro. A double wedding is held, after which Don Pedro is crowned king of Berbania while Juan goes home with Maria to the kingdom of Crystal. There they find out that Maria&rsquo;s father and two sisters have died. Maria then releases from enchantment all her father&rsquo;s victims, and the kingdom becomes populous once more. The couple is crowned king and queen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b> is one of the greatest favorites among Philippine metrical romances.

The title, the poet explains, derives from the root word <i>intok</i>, &ldquo;to knock against or into something,&rdquo; and the process of writing a poem &ldquo;is similar to that of being hit by something&mdash;a thought, a memory, or a wave of feeling&mdash;that takes a small chip out of our humanity and changes us.&rdquo; The person who experiences <i>intok<b> </b></i>goes through three stages: <i>nasabud</i>,<i> </i>when she or he knocks against something; <i>natinggiran</i>,<i> </i>when something of the person is chipped off as a result of being nasabud; and <i>nakalambre</i>, when she or he is &ldquo;knocked into something to the point of breaking.&rdquo; The poems are arranged into three parts, corresponding to these three stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Nasabud&rdquo; contains eight poems dealing with momentary sensations that leave a powerful imprint on the consciousness. In &ldquo;Hingyap&rdquo; (Desire), the poet talks about his impossible wish to attain the world so he may possess the beloved. In &ldquo;Banabana&rdquo; (Approximations), the lover calculates the cost of attaining the object of desire and realizes that not distance nor time but fear is his enemy. In &ldquo;Alok&rdquo; (Witch), Sugbo depicts the poetic impulse as a fearsome and powerful witch who ambushes one with fireflies and scintillating lights when one&rsquo;s defenses are down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the second part, &ldquo;Natinggiran,&rdquo; the poet becomes more contemplative.

The poet personifies wonder as a spirit, whose absence from the land causes all living things to shrink and wither, and people to become restless and lose harmony among themselves and with nature. The poet appeals to the lost spirit to return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There is a homey feel to the book for the Waray reader, who will readily recognize Sugbo&rsquo;s personae, names he calls out with such warmth&mdash;Inse Medying, Apoy Mundo, Islaw, Apoy Toyong, Na Talina, Manoy Intek, Ingko Goyong&mdash;and places smelling of earth and morning dew, like Marrokporok, Hindang, Borongan, Balangiga, Calbiga.

The title poem, &ldquo;Isang Dipang Langit,&rdquo; is a meditation on the poet&rsquo;s prison experience, as well as an affirmation of his boundless faith in the cause of freedom. Hernandez was jailed in the 1950s by the Philippine government for the crime of &ldquo;rebellion complex,&rdquo; a conviction later overturned by the Supreme Court for being unconstitutional. Released after having served his term, Hernandez became active again in the political movement of the 1960s and 1970s.

The poems in this collection are presented in nine thematic sections: humanity, things, time, love, prison, freedom, experience, mother tongue, and Parnassus, the last consisting of Pilipino translations of foreign poems. The collection offers an insight into the wide range of Hernandez&rsquo;s poetic diction ranging across several traditions&mdash;from the romantic strain traceable to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco &quot;Balagtas&quot; Baltazar</a> to the polemical voice of social criticism that began with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> and the revolutionary writer of the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In deciding to bestow the Cultural Heritage Award on Hernandez for <b><i><strong>Isang Dipang Langit</strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the subcommittee on literature declared that &ldquo;Hernandez&rsquo;s achievement is often equal to Villa&rsquo;s and sometimes greater&rdquo; and that his poetry &ldquo;does not blink from the facts of life in the most sordid sense possible of that clich&eacute;, and yet affirms the prevalence of spirit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The award was a recognition of Hernandez&rsquo;s worth as a citizen whose best literary works and lifelong engagement with social issues gave &ldquo;committed literature&rdquo; new heights of respectability and potency in this country. Hernandez has been immortalized by poems other than the title poem, such as &ldquo;Panata sa Kalayaan&rdquo; (Oath to Freedom), &ldquo;Bilanggo&rdquo; (Prisoner), and &ldquo;Kung Tuyo Na ang Luha Mo, Inang Bayan&rdquo; (When Your Tears Run Dry, My Country).

The first one is &ldquo;Nosi Balasi&rdquo; (an inversion of &ldquo;sino ba sila,&rdquo; slang for &ldquo;who are they&rdquo;), which is about the Italian master Giotto&rsquo;s vain attempts at capturing the life of Christ in his paintings. The sequence includes a joke about believers trying to determine who the true god is and the problems posed by the Immaculate Conception to both mother and son, and refers to <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b> (Touch Me Not), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s masterpiece.

The sequence&mdash;which is in a mix of English, Spanish, and German&mdash;begins with the declaration, &ldquo;That which I read but could not contain.&rdquo; It is a reference to the futility of rendering in art or poetry a person whose mystery deepens with every revelation about him. In the end, even artists can only imagine what Rizal must have been like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poems in this collection are language games; but, very much like the diagrams in Shusaku Arakawa&rsquo;s paintings, they too are philosophical notes on the nature of art, poetry, and life. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jose Miguel Arguelles</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a>. Manila: Kabbala.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poet was a member of the group of Ateneo poets called <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5078\">bagay</a> </b>(literally, &ldquo;thing&rdquo;), who championed a &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; approach to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> by writing in spare style or on &ldquo;objectivist&rdquo;&mdash;as opposed to metaphorical&mdash;themes. Lacaba eventually became identified with politicized literature, but the deceptive simplicity that was the hallmark of bagay poetry became the signature style of his social-realist poems, most of which are in this collection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lacaba&rsquo;s poems speak of common people, familiar places, ordinary relationships, commonplace events, familiar objects and animals, folktales, religious beliefs and practices, and the like. But in Lacaba, the treatment of the commonplace is uncommon. It is replete with acerbic wit, raunchy humor, or bitter irony. When Lacaba turns on a disturbing, unusual event, such as in &ldquo;Santong Paspasan&rdquo; (By Force), a poem about a gang-raped virgin, the matter-of-fact juxtaposition of grim humor, naturalistic images, political news, and human cruelty takes on surrealist proportions and climaxes in a scathing, yet understated, indictment of human behavior and the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collection has three sections. Each section has a brief time frame and a popular quotation from Balagtas for its title, thus: &ldquo;1962-1964: &lsquo;Sa Isang Madilim, Gubat na Mapanglaw&rsquo;&rdquo; (1962-1964: In a Forest, Dark and Primeval); &ldquo;1965-1969: &lsquo;At Dito sa Laot ng Dusa&rsquo;t Hinagpis&rsquo;&rdquo; (And Here in the Sea of Suffering and Remorse); &ldquo;1970-1972: &lsquo;Sa Loob at Labas ng Bayan Kong Sawi&rsquo;&rdquo; (1970-1972: Throughout My Pitiful Country).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Included in the book is &ldquo;Paksiw na Ayungin&rdquo; (Vinegar-Cooked Fish). A 23-line heptasyllabic poem, this piece wittily assumes an aphoristic and didactic tone in ostensibly teaching the reader the aesthetics and economics of eating the <i>ayungin</i>,<i> </i>a poor person&rsquo;s fish cooked in vinegar and ginger. The poem&rsquo;s last two lines resonate like a proverb on poverty: &ldquo;Payat man ang ayungin, pabigat din sa tiyan&rdquo; (Though the ayungin be scanty, it fills a space in the tummy).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the last poem in the collection, &ldquo;Ang mga Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan de la Cruz&rdquo; (The Amazing Adventures of Juan de la Cruz), the Filipino Everyperson, a penniless, well-dressed but hungry vagabond, encounters various social types and attitudes on a surreal odyssey one dark night: a bus conductor curses him for smoking, a wall tells him not to urinate on the wayside, a Chinese restaurant fills up his tummy with scents from its delicacies, a theater refuses to honor his movie pass. In Congress a <i>siga </i>or<i> </i>bully tells him to beware of the dog, the palace guard and gardener keep him off the grass, and a pimp drives him away unsated because he has no money for a whore. Juan attempts suicide, but the sea by the boulevard says it does not accept garbage; he enters a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> to seek some answers and, finding none, Juan, now dressed in tatters, still penniless and unspeakably hungry, goes up the mountain of Arayat, the legendary lair of rebels and social bandits.

However, the period in which he wrote these poems, 1974-79, was also the height of the martial law regime, when explicit protest, not personal or private literature, was the dominant mode.

It is also a universe of cement and iron and guards in fatigue, not unlike Manila then and even now. Hence, we are surprised when the middle stanza suddenly announces: &ldquo;Ito na ang Rusya&rdquo; (This is Russia at last).

The book&rsquo;s second section continues Tinio&rsquo;s expressions of love for his family. Here, the persona as husband and father bares his vulnerability and helplessness, anger and remorse, wonder and awe at the frailty and power of familial love. The first poem, &ldquo;Pasalitang Awit&rdquo; (Spoken Song), dedicated to Ella, demonstrates a love so inexpressible it can only be approximated by the magical language of poetry.

Translators, Nicole Revel-Macdonald and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo B. Maranan</a>. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is one of the 63 epics of Palawan. Recorded and translated into French by Nicole Revel-Macdonald, it is composed of six songs. To date, only the second song, sung by the bard <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5753\">Usuy</a>, has been translated to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>. It takes seven nights to perform the epic. The first night is used to introduce the epic; each of the six songs takes a night to perform. The hero Kudaman appears after the introductory chant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the river Tabunganan is a spring, which is the abode of an evil spirit. Tuwan Putli, accompanied by her cousin Ambaynan, goes there to fish. As they are about to leave, Tuwan Putli sees a river lobster with golden pincers. Ambaynan waits for her, but Tuwan Putli disappears. There is blood in her fish basket. Ambaynan goes home and reports the incident.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mu-Muta, Tuwan Putli&rsquo;s father, orders her husband (and his son-in-law) Muta-Muta to search for her, but the man disobeys. Muta-Muta finds help in the person of the Young Man of the Clouds. It is agreed that if the Young Man of the Clouds can find Tuwan Putli, she will be his. With the help of a crocodile, the Young Man of the Clouds finds a fragment of Tuwan Putli&rsquo;s toenail nestled inside a molar of an old crocodile. The old crocodile had accidentally eaten Tuwan Putli. Retrieving the nail, he sees Mu-Muta, who tells him to bring home the nail fragment. The Young Man puts the nail inside a golden chest. In the afternoon, Tuwan Putli&rsquo;s voice is heard inside the chest, pleading to be let out. The chest breaks open like a bamboo, filling the house with golden light. Tuwan Putli emerges and asks for a betel nut. Learning that the Young Man has rescued her, she consents to live with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon, the Young Man falls in love with the Lady of the Sea-Beings, the wife of Kudaman. The Young Man wins her love, forcing his wife, Tuwan Putli, to leave him. Kudaman decides to bring the Lady of the Sea-Beings to her father Surutan Tamparan, the Sultan of the Seacoast. On his journey back aboard Linggisan the Purple Heron, Kudaman meets Tuwan Putli and offers her a betel nut. She accepts, and she becomes his <i>puun</i> or principal wife. When Surutan Tamparan discovers that his daughter has left Kudaman for the Young Man of the Clouds, he beheads her at the place called Scissors of the World. But she emerges from the ordeal lovelier than ever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Muta-Muta, Tuwan Putli&rsquo;s first husband, and his brother, the Datu of Ligayan, visit Kudaman to offer a blood compact. Kudaman reminds Muta-Muta that Tuwan Putli is now his wife. Having become Kudaman&rsquo;s blood brother, Muta-Muta asks to stay in his place. Kudaman agrees, and he has a big house built. Kudaman gathers his relatives and friends and offers to host a big feast of <i>tabad </i>(rice beer).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kudaman goes on a journey to look for beautiful garments for Tuwan Putli, whom he entrusts to Muta-Muta. Riding on Linggisan, his pet bird, Kudaman travels for seven years. The Lady of the Wild Green Pigeon falls in love with him. The attraction is mutual, so Kudaman promises to return for her. Reaching the house of the Sultan of the Seacoast, Kudaman buys the garments he wants. His former wife expresses renewed yearning for him and his bird, so she is transported to Kudaman&rsquo;s house, where she is welcomed by Tuwan Putli as sister and co-wife. As he has promised, Kudaman passes by the place of the Lady of the Wild Green Pigeon on his way back. He asks for betel nut, and she offers him her betel-nut container. When she agrees to come with him, he puts her inside his betel container for safekeeping. Tuwan Putli meets him with the news that the Lady of the Sea-Beings has come. Kudaman shows her what he has brought home: a new sister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kudaman goes on another journey, entrusting the two women to his principal wife. He encounters the Lady of the Ginuu Tree, who is gripped with admiration for his magnificent bird. Kudaman obtains her, as he did the Lady of the Wild Green Pigeon, but the Lady of the Ginuu Tree makes it clear to the other women that she has no desire to win the hero away from them, and that she has come with him only because she loves his bird.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Having put up his new <i>kolongbanwa </i>or big house, Kudaman wishes to offer a celebration in honor of Ampu, the Master of the Rice. Muta-Muta, Datu Ligayan, and the four <i>linamin</i> or ladies are in agreement. He lays his hands over the mouths of the jars of <i>tabad</i>, and right away, the rice beer ferments. Muta-Muta and Datu Ligayan play their gongs, for this is the music beloved of the Master of the Rice, who bestows sweetness and fragrance to the rice beer. Clad in wondrous garments and ornaments of gold, Kudaman&rsquo;s four wives dance the <i>tarok</i>,<i> </i>and they prepare the betel chew for their guests. The Young Man of the Clouds hears the music from the feast, and he hastens to join Kudaman. But far away, the dreaded Ilanun also hear the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>, and they decide to test the mettle of Kudaman and get his wives. Informed through a dream, Kudaman orders the gong music to stop. He does not want violence, for it is an affront to Ampu, the Supreme Master, who is also Nagsalad, the Weaver of the World. He is the picture of calm as he awaits the Ilanun&rsquo;s arrival, chewing betel as he sits. He invites the Ilanun to come to the house, but they harshly reject the offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Muta-Muta loses his restraint and attacks. The Young Man of the Clouds joins him. The leader of the Ilanun and the Young Man of the Clouds duel in the heavens for seven years. Moved by the Young Man&rsquo;s spirit, Kudaman joins the fray. He entrusts to his grieving wives a bouquet of basil flowers whose wilting or blossoming will signal his state. The ladies plead that Linggasan watch over its master; the bird itself is anguished over Kudaman&rsquo;s decision to fight. Up in the clouds, astride a ray of sunlight, Kudaman merely observes at first. But when the Young Man of the Clouds falls, he comes to the Young Man&rsquo;s rescue and puts the Young Man inside his betel container. Then he confronts the Ilanun leader, Apo Tugbu. A battle between them lasts for many years, taking them to several levels of the world. Finally, Kudaman wins. The Ilanun are wiped out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On their way home, Kudaman and the Young Man of the Clouds pass by the house of Limbuhanan, the hero&rsquo;s first cousin. They meet the Lady of the Agoho Tree, Limbuhanan&rsquo;s wife. The couple apologize to Kudaman for having gotten married without notifying him. The Young Man of the Clouds relates the war he and Kudaman have just been through. The Lady of the Agoho Tree offers to accompany the two back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Muta-Muta, Datu Ligayan, and the four wives are overjoyed when Kudaman arrives. The interrupted feast resumes. A jural discussion is held, regarding harmonious relationship in marriage, the duties of relatives, and other points of the <i>adat </i>or custom law. Among the guests are the Datu and Lady of the Edge of the World, the Datu and Lady of the Surrounding World, the Datu and Lady of Median Space, the Chief Judge Pinagsaraan and his wife, the Lady of the Luray Tree, the Lady of the Sails, the Lady of the Western Wind, and the Lady of the Atmosphere. The Sultan of the Seacoast arrives with his seven wives, and he is offered the first sip of the tabad. The merriment lasts for three days, but no violence nor rowdiness occurs. Kudaman finds himself in a state of stupor. His being is transported, it seems, to another universe, and the heavens have been cindered by his drunkenness. But he is brought back to consciousness, and, seeing the face of the Lady of the Hooks, he proposes to marry her. Revived, Kudaman chews betel and spits at the dead army of the Ilanun. They are resurrected, and they surrender their weapons as a sign of compact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Earlier, during the start of the feast, an old conflict over Tuwan Putli between Kudaman and the Chief Judge Pinagsaraan took place. The Lady of the Luray Tree, wife of Pinagsaraan, proposed that Tuwan Putli be cut in two so that the two men could each have half of her. Kudaman takes a blade and slices her. Each half of her becomes a lovelier Tuwan Putli. The Sultan of the Seacoast takes his leave, and the others follow suit, but not before everyone has agreed that there must be another feast in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rest of the epic contains episodes about Kudaman&rsquo;s odysseys to distant lands and visitations of friends and relatives, during which great feasts are held. In one of his drunken revelries, having gulped down 180 jars of tabad, Kudaman plummets into the navel of the world and wrestles with himself. In his drunken state, he meets the Lady of the Young Men, who fans his face to bring him back to his senses and offers him betel chew. She becomes his fifth wife. Riding his heron to the ends of the world, Kudaman wins his other wives who are all uniformly described as falling into a swoon at the sight of his magnificent bird. They are the Lady of the Sandbar, who leaves her husband to go with the hero; the Lady of the Last Level of the Universe; the Lady of the Oil of the World; the Lady of the Maiden Space, also married; and the Lady of the Hooks, to whom he had earlier proposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Kudaman</i></b><i> </i>ends with a final celebration of Kudaman&rsquo;s marriage to 10 women. At the same time, the Young Man of the Clouds takes the Sultan&rsquo;s seventh daughter in marriage, and the dowry he gives is a river which begins from the skies and flows right beside the Sultan&rsquo;s house, while a makopa tree and a pomelo tree bear fruit the whole year round. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Edgardo Maranan</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Macdonald, Nicole Revel, and Edgardo Maranan. 1988. <em>Kudaman</em>.

Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is a collection of 82 poems divided into four sections.

The persona is a lover who is &ldquo;nangangarap&rdquo; (dreaming) and &ldquo;punong-puno ng pag-asa&rdquo; (full of hope), whether she is imploring one to partake in a relationship in &ldquo;Soneto sa Isang Ginoo&rdquo; (Sonnet for a Gentleman), pining for affection and intimacy in &ldquo;Iniisip Ka&rdquo; (Thinking of You) and &ldquo;Muli&rdquo; (Again), waiting for a beloved&rsquo;s return in &ldquo;Yakap ng Aking Mahal&rdquo; (My Love&rsquo;s Embrace), or offering oneself completely to love in &ldquo;Sapagkat&rdquo; (Because) and &ldquo;Sa Anumang Kalagayan&rdquo; (In Whatever Circumstance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the second section, the consummation of this desire becomes the dominant theme. Mabanglo renders love using elements of summer, depicting it as being bright and burning. Such celebratory mood is found in &ldquo;Kapirasong Silid&rdquo; (A Little Room), &ldquo;Tula, Erotika&rdquo; (Poem, Erotica), and &ldquo;Lugod&rdquo; (Pleasure).

In &ldquo;Sapul Nang Mawala Ka&rdquo; (Since You Left), &ldquo;Ang mga Araw na Wala Ka Rito&rdquo; (The Days When You Are Not Here), and &ldquo;Nagtatago ang Aking Dila&rdquo; (My Tongue Is Hiding), the absence of the beloved leaves the persona broken and helpless. In &ldquo;Nangungulila Ako sa Iyo&rdquo; (Longing for You), the lover feels insecure despite the presence of the beloved. In &ldquo;Humihiwa ang mga Salita&rdquo; (Words Are Sharp), the persona warns of the impending demise of love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poems in the fourth section portray the &ldquo;winter&rdquo; of love; love is an unvisited grave. The poems convey the woman&rsquo;s sadness and sense of loss, whether in remembering the past in &ldquo;Sinasakyan Ko ang Aking Sarili&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m Getting Along with Myself), &ldquo;Sa Alaala&rdquo; (In Memory), and &ldquo;Hindi Mo Kilala ang Kalupitang Ito&rdquo; (You Do Not Know This Cruelty), acknowledging the futility of an affair in &ldquo;Mindanao&rdquo; and &ldquo;Huling Tula Ko Sa Iyo&rdquo; (My Last Poem for You), or letting go of an unrequited love in &ldquo;Totoo&rdquo; (True).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the final poem, &ldquo;Kung Ibig Mo Akong Makilala&rdquo; (If You Want to Know Me), which has been popularized as a song by Susan Fernandez Magno in the 1990s, Mabanglo employs anaphora, entreating the reader to resuscitate love.

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemheadLIT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Published 1965. Transcriber, Felipe Landa Jocano, &ldquo;The Epic of Labaw Donggon,&rdquo; <b><i>Social Sciences and Humanities Review</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></i></b> is one of the two cycles, generally considered epics in their own right, that compose <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b>, the epic of the Sulod, a people of central Panay. The other cycle focuses on the adventures of Humadapnon, Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s nephew or son. During communal affairs, appropriate parts of the <b><i>Labaw Donggon</i></b> are sung in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2358\">Karay-a</a> by a <i>baylan</i> (shaman), selected for his/her age and reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 2,325-line epic was recorded by Felipe Landa Jocano, who published it with an English translation in 1964. In typescript, the epic was 3,822 lines long. Jocano&rsquo;s source was Ulang Udig, who had learned the epic from his grandfather. The recording took place in Barrio Misi in Lambunao, Iloilo. Its rhyme scheme is created by the frequent line endings <i>a</i>,<i> an</i>,<i> un</i>.<i> </i>Its rhythm generally follows an iambic-anapestic combination. However, variation in rhyme and meter does occur, especially as the epic is sung. Although it is part of a larger epic called <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b>,<i> <b>Labaw</b> <b>Donggon</b> </i>itself can be divided into two parts. The first part deals with Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s amorous exploits. In the second part, Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s son Baranugun plays the leading role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Labaw Donggon is the son of Anggoy Alunsina, a <i>diwata </i>or goddess who has dominion over the eastern sky, and Buyung Paubari. On the day he is born, Labaw Donggon matures physically and speaks. He asks his mother for magic suits kept in the <i>barugbugan umbaw</i>,<i> </i>a great wooden chest. Dressed in his loose shirt, his embroidered headband, his hat called <i>saramingku</i>,<i> </i>and his metal belt <i>iskumilya</i>,<i> </i>Labaw tells his mother of his intentions. He wants to court the <i>binukot</i>,<i> </i>a kept maiden, Abyang Ginbitinan, who lives by the Halawod River. Anggoy Alunsina reluctantly consents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Labaw reaches his beloved&rsquo;s house, he asks for permission to enter it. He states his purpose for coming, but the girl&rsquo;s mother, Anggoy Matanayon, replies from within the house that all her daughters have been married to very distinguished personages of the underworld. Only the <i>uripon </i>or slaves accompany her. Labaw disagrees politely and asserts that he saw her daughter near the drinking well and by the window. Labaw then praises her beauty. Labaw asks Matanayon to lower the ladder so that he may go up the house and warm himself from the cold. Anggoy Matanayon refuses, until Labaw agrees to pay a bride-price. As Labaw is ascending the steps, Matanayon tries to discourage him, but Labaw enters the house nonetheless and proceeds to the room of the binukot. Abyang Ginbitinan&rsquo;s beauty enchants him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Labaw tells her that he has to return home to consult with his parents regarding his marriage plans. He promises to return after a few days. In hardly a moment&rsquo;s time, however, Labaw is back at his home and asks his parents to make arrangements with Abyang Ginbitinan&rsquo;s parents. Soon, Labaw&rsquo;s parents are in Anggoy Matanayon&rsquo;s yard. Anggoy Matanayon agrees to a wedding, but only if Labaw presents the bride gift she wants&mdash;a great wooden chest filled with treasure and valuable clothes. Buyung Paubari agrees and even offers to build Matanayon a mansion. Labaw calls upon his <i>pamlang </i>(psychic powers) to empower him to build the mansion. The girl&rsquo;s parents are impressed, and so a wedding ensues. Water is added to rice wine in a large, brown unglazed jar. The rice wine is poured into a cup, which is passed around for the guests to drink of the wine. The bride drinks first, after which the groom takes his share. The marriage is thus consummated, and Buyung Paubari tells his family to return home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Not long after his first marriage, Labaw&rsquo;s heart grows restless. He wants another binukot, Anggoy Doronoon of the underworld, of whose beauty he has heard. At first, Ginbitinan rebukes him for his promiscuity, but, finding him resolute, she gives in. Labaw entreats his first wife to bring him his magic suit, as he did the first time with his mother. Like his mother, she reluctantly agrees. Dressed splendidly, he arrives at the yard of Anggoy Doronoon in the underworld. Labaw asks for permission from the master of the house to ascend to their abode. He inquires whether he is trespassing on any charm or prohibition. A voice tells him that he may have bad intentions for coming, so the voice decides to remove the ladder to prevent Labaw from entering the house. Labaw delivers practically the same speech which he used to win Anggoy Gibitinan. Anggoy Doronoon herself answers him this time. She claims that she is already betrothed to an underworld deity, and that she has no sisters but only uripon with her. Labaw does not believe her. Instead, he woos her with flattery. As in his first wooing, he is admitted to the house but only after he promises to pay for every rung of the ladder he steps on in gold and in heirlooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once up, Labaw goes straight to the room of the binukot despite discouragement from the girl&rsquo;s mother. Labaw and Anggoy Doronoon are married.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Shortly afterward, Labaw is again love sick. He wants another binukot: Malitung Yawa Sinagmaling Diwata, a goddess. Again, he tells his first wife Anggoy Ginbitinan to bring out his magic suit. He rides a boat to look for Malitung Yawa. Labaw is temporarily halted in Dingli, whose stone walls reach high up into the sky and sink deep in the earth. Labaw finds himself enveloped in total darkness. His pamlang, however, helps his boat soar above and beyond the walls. Labaw peers into his crystal ball and sees Malitung Yawa. But he, in turn, is observed by Buyung Saragnayan, Malitung Yawa&rsquo;s husband, who controls the course of the sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wondering about Labaw&rsquo;s intentions, Saragnayan plans to challenge him. Labaw&rsquo;s crystal ball, however, warns him. Labaw tells Saragnayan of his purpose. Saragnayan replies that he can have his wife only in his death, and he challenges Labaw to a duel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The two first use charms to test whose magic is greater. Saragnayan calls upon his pamlang to destroy Labaw&rsquo;s oil container, which holds his charms. Labaw&rsquo;s oil container is shattered; and momentarily, Labaw loses his pride and spirit. But he regains his composure and calls on his pamlang to destroy Saragnayan&rsquo;s oil container. Labaw&rsquo;s pamlang fails him. Having been defeated in the battle of charms, Labaw challenges Saragnayan to physical combat. They wrestle. Labaw submerges Saragnayan in the water and brings him up only after seven years. But Saragnayan does not die, for his life force is kept inside the body of a wild pig roaming in Paling Bukid. Labaw then beats Saragnayan with several coconut trunks, but Saragnayan still lives. Labaw then hurls Saragnayan to the sky and twirls him in the clouds, but still Saragnayan lives. Many more years pass and Labaw Donggon weakens. The indefatigable Saragnayan ties Labaw&rsquo;s arms and feet, and imprisons him in the pigpen below his kitchen. Labaw becomes dejected and sorrowful, for he now has tasted defeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Anggoy Ginbitinan gives birth to a son. He is named Asu Mangga. In the underworld, Doronoon also delivers a baby, Buyung Baranugun, whose umbilical cord is uncut. Both sons possess physical and magical prowess, and they can speak as soon as they are born. They share a common goal to look for their father. Baranugun requests that his mother open his wooden chest of magic charms so that he may consult them about his father&rsquo;s fate. He tells her that he will travel across the seas to look for Labaw. Doronoon protests, saying that he is still a child. But Baranugun tells his mother that his being a small child is a reason why he must go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He will prove to others who the son of Labaw in the underworld is. As his father did before, he entreats his mother to take out his magic suit. He arms himself with his special dagger. In the meantime, Asu Mangga wonders about his father. He, too, wishes to look for his father. When he asks his mother to prepare his magic suit, Ginbitinan tells him that he may meet a handsome young man from the underworld who is actually his brother, whom he must not fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Riding a boat, Asu Mangga journeys until he reaches Dingli, the land of stone walls. From afar, Asu Mangga sees his younger brother walking over the sea, for he has no boat to ride on. Asu Mangga invites him to ride with him. The brothers get acquainted and speculate about their father. They consult a crystal ball and see their father, now hairy, imprisoned beneath Saragnayan&rsquo;s kitchen. Baranugun is moved to tears and vows to liberate their father. Baranugun calls upon his pamlang to take them to Saragnayan&rsquo;s domain, the land of the morning sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Labaw is comforted by the thought that his children may be looking for him. At this time too, Asu Mangga brings their vessel close to shore. Saragnayan sees them and wonders who they may be. Upon reaching the shore, Baranugun unties his father&rsquo;s boat and ties it to their own. Earlier, Saragnayan put a <i>tagadlem</i>,<i> </i>a charm of invisibility on their father&rsquo;s boat, but Baranugun&rsquo;s charms overcome it. The brothers tow away their father&rsquo;s boat and look into their magic kit to search for clues regarding their father&rsquo;s whereabouts. Baranugun goes directly under Saragnayan&rsquo;s house. Saragnayan&rsquo;s guards&mdash;pet monkeys&mdash;attack, but Baranugun kills them easily with his dagger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baranugun finds his father, overgrown with hair, and he taps his father on the shoulder. He asks why his father has allowed himself to be overcome, to which Labaw answers that he was overpowered by Saragnayan&rsquo;s superior charm. Asu Mangga calls upon his pamlang to make the iron bars imprisoning their father collapse and scatter out to the sea. Baranugun takes his father&rsquo;s hand and leads him to their magic boat. They bless their father with exotic vines in order to reinvigorate his charms. Labaw Donggon is revived. He recounts his battle with Saragnayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baranugun tells his father that he and his brother will challenge Saragnayan. They stand on opposite sides of their boat and shout mightily. Their call is as strong as their father&rsquo;s, reverberating 10 times around the world and shattering bamboo tops. Saragnayan, in bed with his wife, is frightened. He wonders how Labaw has escaped. He gathers his forces and calls for many young men to come to his aid. Baranugun tells him to fight alone, for Baranugun is only a small child with an uncut umbilical cord. But Saragnayan tells Malitung Yawa to get his gong, which he beats while he is invoking the spirits of the underworld to help him. His allies from the underworld appear and fill his mansion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baranugun declares that he will die for his father to prove to Saragnayan who Labaw&rsquo;s true sons are. Then addressing Saragnayan&rsquo;s multitude of allies, he tells them that they are not involved in his fight against Saragnayan. He expresses pity for them and for their wives whom they have left behind. Saragnayan&rsquo;s followers, however, do not heed the warning. They all die from Baranugun&rsquo;s arrows. Then Baranugun confronts Saragnayan, but the latter appears invulnerable. Labaw advises his son to find a way of killing the mighty Saragnayan. Baranugun sends two spirits, a <i>taghuy </i>and a <i>duwindi</i>,<i> </i>to Abyang Alunsina to ask her how to defeat Saragnayan. Alunsina tells the spirit-messengers that Saragnayan&rsquo;s life force is kept in the body of a boar. Baranugun, however, does not know how to reach the wild boar&rsquo;s haunt. So he sends back his spirit-messengers to Alunsina, who instructs them on how to find and kill the boar. She gives the messengers a sleeping charm with which the brothers can put the boar to sleep. Having the charm, Baranugun goes to Paling Bukid where the wild boar roams. Quickly, Baranugun lands in Paling Bukid and puts his charm to work on the wild boar. The charm is effective and, while the boar is sleeping, Baranugun marvels at its size. Then, he slays it with his poisoned arrow. He cuts up the boar and, with Asu Mangga, eats its heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">They return to Saragnayan&rsquo;s domain. Baranugun tells Saragnayan that his brother and he have already eaten the boar, where Saragnayan has kept his life force. Saragnayan realizes his impending doom. Saragnayan bides for time and asks for permission to say good-bye to his beloved wife. Baranugun allows him to go home. When Saragnayan reaches his mansion, all the plants are wilting, a sign of foreboding. He weeps when he sees his wife and tells her that Baranugan has overcome him. He advises her to obey whatever Labaw Donggon wishes. He praises Labaw and his sons, for he knows they are mighty warriors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Malitung Yawa tells her husband that she will obey whatever he says. She reproaches him for merely imprisoning Labaw when he should have devoured him right away. His sons would not have found him. Saragnayan cuddles his wife to sleep and tells the servants to drive away the flies that may disturb her sleep. After kissing and caressing her, Saragnayan confronts Baranugun. Baranugun tells him that they will fight by sheer physical strength alone. They wrestle, but Baranugun manages to leap behind his adversary. Saragnayan strikes at him with his knife and misses. Baranugun manages to get behind Saragnayan again while holding him at the waist. Baranugun climbs on top of Saragnayan&rsquo;s head and shoots his poisoned arrow directly into Saragnayan&rsquo;s eyes. Saragnayan writhes in pain and gives out a cry. The mighty cry sends the world a-trembling. The fall of Saragnayan&rsquo;s body causes tremors, for the earthquake is kept in his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baranugun pities the dead Saragnayan but exonerates himself, saying that he needed to avenge his father. When Baranugun turns to tell his father that they can now return home, Labaw Donggon is nowhere to be seen, having been frightened by the arrival of Saragnayan&rsquo;s underworld brothers. Baranugun kills them with his poisoned arrows. After that battle, Baranugun quickly pushes his magic vessel homeward. Baranugun is happy to return home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, down on earth, Humadapnon and Dumalapdap, Labaw&rsquo;s brothers, are concerned about the whereabouts of Labaw. They see that the blood of Saragnayan&rsquo;s men has flooded the world, and their multicolored life-substances form a rainbow of different colors. Labaw&rsquo;s brothers finally find him hiding inside a fishnet, covering himself and trembling with fright. They help him out of it and cajole him to go back home to his wives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But Labaw&rsquo;s ears are closed, and he has lost his hearing and his sanity. Labaw&rsquo;s wives cry in pity for him. Even as they are thinking of a way to help Labaw regain his old self, however, Ginbitinan chides Labaw that he brought his state upon himself by coveting other people&rsquo;s wives. Humadapnon retorts that that is how all valiant fighters should behave. Then he asks Malitung Yawa whether her sisters are Burigadang Pada and Lubaylubyuk Hanginon. The brothers fall in love with the sisters and decide to court them at once. Dumalapdap falls for Lubaylubyuk, while Humadapnon wants Burigadang Pada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Labaw Donggon, even in his demented state, says that they will have to get Malitung Yawa for his wife. At Labaw&rsquo;s remark, both his first two wives are alarmed. They threaten that they will not restore his power if he weds Malitung Yawa. Labaw tells them that they will all be treated equally. He tells them that valiant fighters such as he must possess more women, so that they may have more sons who will inherit their name and who will become just as mighty as they are. Convinced of their husband&rsquo;s sincerity, the wives lay Labaw down and jump over his head and feet, while they invoke the powerful pamlang to restore him. Afterward, they help him up and tell him to shout as he once did. Labaw gives a cry so mighty that branches snap and great trees are ripped apart. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5493\"> E.

The other cycle focuses on the adventures of Humadapnon, Labaw Donggon&#x2019;s nephew or son. During communal affairs, appropriate parts of the <b><i>Labaw Donggon</i></b> are sung in <a href=\"/1/2/2358\">Karay-a</a> by a <i>baylan</i> (shaman), selected for his/her age and reputation."

Jocano&#x2019;s source was Ulang Udig, who had learned the epic from his grandfather. The recording took place in Barrio Misi in Lambunao, Iloilo. Its rhyme scheme is created by the frequent line endings <i>a</i>,<i> an</i>,<i> un</i>.<i> </i>Its rhythm generally follows an iambic-anapestic combination. However, variation in rhyme and meter does occur, especially as the epic is sung. Although it is part of a larger epic called <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b>,<i> <b>Labaw</b> <b>Donggon</b> </i>itself can be divided into two parts. The first part deals with Labaw Donggon&#x2019;s amorous exploits. In the second part, Labaw Donggon&#x2019;s son Baranugun plays the leading role."

On the day he is born, Labaw Donggon matures physically and speaks. He asks his mother for magic suits kept in the <i>barugbugan umbaw</i>,<i> </i>a great wooden chest. Dressed in his loose shirt, his embroidered headband, his hat called <i>saramingku</i>,<i> </i>and his metal belt <i>iskumilya</i>,<i> </i>Labaw tells his mother of his intentions. He wants to court the <i>binukot</i>,<i> </i>a kept maiden, Abyang Ginbitinan, who lives by the Halawod River. Anggoy Alunsina reluctantly consents."

He states his purpose for coming, but the girl&#x2019;s mother, Anggoy Matanayon, replies from within the house that all her daughters have been married to very distinguished personages of the underworld. Only the <i>uripon </i>or slaves accompany her. Labaw disagrees politely and asserts that he saw her daughter near the drinking well and by the window. Labaw then praises her beauty. Labaw asks Matanayon to lower the ladder so that he may go up the house and warm himself from the cold. Anggoy Matanayon refuses, until Labaw agrees to pay a bride-price. As Labaw is ascending the steps, Matanayon tries to discourage him, but Labaw enters the house nonetheless and proceeds to the room of the binukot. Abyang Ginbitinan&#x2019;s beauty enchants him."

In hardly a moment&#x2019;s time, however, Labaw is back at his home and asks his parents to make arrangements with Abyang Ginbitinan&#x2019;s parents. Soon, Labaw&#x2019;s parents are in Anggoy Matanayon&#x2019;s yard. Anggoy Matanayon agrees to a wedding, but only if Labaw presents the bride gift she wants&#x2014;a great wooden chest filled with treasure and valuable clothes. Buyung Paubari agrees and even offers to build Matanayon a mansion. Labaw calls upon his <i>pamlang </i>(psychic powers) to empower him to build the mansion. The girl&#x2019;s parents are impressed, and so a wedding ensues. Water is added to rice wine in a large, brown unglazed jar. The rice wine is poured into a cup, which is passed around for the guests to drink of the wine. The bride drinks first, after which the groom takes his share. The marriage is thus consummated, and Buyung Paubari tells his family to return home."

At first, Ginbitinan rebukes him for his promiscuity, but, finding him resolute, she gives in. Labaw entreats his first wife to bring him his magic suit, as he did the first time with his mother. Like his mother, she reluctantly agrees. Dressed splendidly, he arrives at the yard of Anggoy Doronoon in the underworld. Labaw asks for permission from the master of the house to ascend to their abode. He inquires whether he is trespassing on any charm or prohibition. A voice tells him that he may have bad intentions for coming, so the voice decides to remove the ladder to prevent Labaw from entering the house. Labaw delivers practically the same speech which he used to win Anggoy Gibitinan. Anggoy Doronoon herself answers him this time. She claims that she is already betrothed to an underworld deity, and that she has no sisters but only uripon with her. Labaw does not believe her. Instead, he woos her with flattery. As in his first wooing, he is admitted to the house but only after he promises to pay for every rung of the ladder he steps on in gold and in heirlooms."

Again, he tells his first wife Anggoy Ginbitinan to bring out his magic suit. He rides a boat to look for Malitung Yawa. Labaw is temporarily halted in Dingli, whose stone walls reach high up into the sky and sink deep in the earth. Labaw finds himself enveloped in total darkness. His pamlang, however, helps his boat soar above and beyond the walls. Labaw peers into his crystal ball and sees Malitung Yawa. But he, in turn, is observed by Buyung Saragnayan, Malitung Yawa&#x2019;s husband, who controls the course of the sun."

Labaw&#x2019;s oil container is shattered; and momentarily, Labaw loses his pride and spirit. But he regains his composure and calls on his pamlang to destroy Saragnayan&#x2019;s oil container. Labaw&#x2019;s pamlang fails him. Having been defeated in the battle of charms, Labaw challenges Saragnayan to physical combat. They wrestle. Labaw submerges Saragnayan in the water and brings him up only after seven years. But Saragnayan does not die, for his life force is kept inside the body of a wild pig roaming in Paling Bukid. Labaw then beats Saragnayan with several coconut trunks, but Saragnayan still lives. Labaw then hurls Saragnayan to the sky and twirls him in the clouds, but still Saragnayan lives. Many more years pass and Labaw Donggon weakens. The indefatigable Saragnayan ties Labaw&#x2019;s arms and feet, and imprisons him in the pigpen below his kitchen. Labaw becomes dejected and sorrowful, for he now has tasted defeat."

Both sons possess physical and magical prowess, and they can speak as soon as they are born. They share a common goal to look for their father. Baranugun requests that his mother open his wooden chest of magic charms so that he may consult them about his father&#x2019;s fate. He tells her that he will travel across the seas to look for Labaw. Doronoon protests, saying that he is still a child. But Baranugun tells his mother that his being a small child is a reason why he must go."

Asu Mangga invites him to ride with him. The brothers get acquainted and speculate about their father. They consult a crystal ball and see their father, now hairy, imprisoned beneath Saragnayan&#x2019;s kitchen. Baranugun is moved to tears and vows to liberate their father. Baranugun calls upon his pamlang to take them to Saragnayan&#x2019;s domain, the land of the morning sun."

Saragnayan sees them and wonders who they may be. Upon reaching the shore, Baranugun unties his father&#x2019;s boat and ties it to their own. Earlier, Saragnayan put a <i>tagadlem</i>,<i> </i>a charm of invisibility on their father&#x2019;s boat, but Baranugun&#x2019;s charms overcome it. The brothers tow away their father&#x2019;s boat and look into their magic kit to search for clues regarding their father&#x2019;s whereabouts. Baranugun goes directly under Saragnayan&#x2019;s house. Saragnayan&#x2019;s guards&#x2014;pet monkeys&#x2014;attack, but Baranugun kills them easily with his dagger."

He asks why his father has allowed himself to be overcome, to which Labaw answers that he was overpowered by Saragnayan&#x2019;s superior charm. Asu Mangga calls upon his pamlang to make the iron bars imprisoning their father collapse and scatter out to the sea. Baranugun takes his father&#x2019;s hand and leads him to their magic boat. They bless their father with exotic vines in order to reinvigorate his charms. Labaw Donggon is revived. He recounts his battle with Saragnayan."

Their call is as strong as their father&#x2019;s, reverberating 10 times around the world and shattering bamboo tops. Saragnayan, in bed with his wife, is frightened. He wonders how Labaw has escaped. He gathers his forces and calls for many young men to come to his aid. Baranugun tells him to fight alone, for Baranugun is only a small child with an uncut umbilical cord. But Saragnayan tells Malitung Yawa to get his gong, which he beats while he is invoking the spirits of the underworld to help him. His allies from the underworld appear and fill his mansion."

The first volume consists of the works of 28 writers. Nine of them reappear in the second anthology and 19 debut there.

It is sung in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> during festivals even today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic has six known versions. The earliest is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5237\">Isabelo de los Reyes</a> version, so called because its recording was erroneously attributed to de los Reyes. It was actually recorded by Fr Gerardo Blanco. De los Reyes first published it in <b><i>El Ilocano</i></b><i> </i>with a Spanish prose translation in Dec 1889 to Feb 1890 and later in <b><i>El Folklore Filipino</i></b>,<i> </i>1890. Canuto Medina, an Ilocano poet, is said to have recorded an earlier version, but his earliest edition is dated 1906, titled <b><i>Pangrugian a Pacasaritaan iti Panagbiag ni Lam-ang</i></b>. The Parayno Hermanos version, titled <b><i>Historia ti Pacasaritaan ti Panagbiag ni Lam-ang iti ili ti Nalbuan nga Asawa ni Do&ntilde;a Ines Cannoyan iti ili a Calanotian</i></b>, 1924, is the most popular version, having undergone three reprintings. <b><i>La Lucha</i></b> serialized another version, titled <b><i>Biag ni Lam-ang: Daan a Sarita</i></b>. Leopoldo Y. Yabes made a composite edition, combining episodes from all previous versions in 1935. He also added some episodes absent from the previous editions; his version is 11 stanzas longer. Two other versions are those by Francisco Magana, also known as the Llanes Transcription, 1947, and by Carlo Magno Tacdol, transcribed by Domingo Valdez in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">English translations of the epic date as far back as 1916, with the translation of the Blanco version by Anastacio B. Gerardo, Mercedes Vega, Andres S. Nicolas, and Mariano L. Mencias. The Medina version was translated by Cornelio N. Valdez in 1919-20. Yabes translated the epic twice, once in 1935 and again in 1958. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a> poet Amado M. Yuzon made an English verse translation in <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Life</i></b><i> <b>of</b> <b>Lam</b>-<b>ang</b> <b>(Ti Panagbiag ni Lam-ang): A Philippine <strong>Epic</strong> in Iloko</b></i>,<i> </i>1955. The epic was adapted as a stage musical in 2004 by Jose B. Capino and Von de Guzman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Namongan gives birth to Lam-ang, a baby of incredible strength and courage. The boy asks his mother about his father&rsquo;s whereabouts and learns that he has gone to fight the Igorot. Lam-ang arms himself with charms and decides to look for his father. From a dream, he learns that his father Don Juan Panganiban has been killed by the Igorot. Later, Lam-ang finds Igorot in a <i>sagang</i>,<i> </i>a feast celebrating a successful head-hunting expedition. His father&rsquo;s head is displayed in the feast. Lam-ang slays them all with his spear and mutilates the last among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Lam-ang returns home, 99 maidens wash his hair in the river. For his shampoo, he burns so much rice straw that the communities near the river are alarmed by the smoke. The dirt from his hair kills all the fish in the river. He then kills a crocodile and carries it on his shoulder ashore amid the applause of his companions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lam-ang hears of a beautiful maiden named Ines Kanoyan, daughter of the richest man of the town of Kalanutian. He tells his mother of his desire to court the maiden. Although his mother discourages him, he goes anyway, dressed in gold and accompanied by his pet rooster and white dog. The giant Sumarang blocks his way and belittles him. Lam-ang defeats him in a duel and hurls him nine hills away. Later, Saridandan tries to seduce him, but Lam-ang rejects her advances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reaching Kalanutian, he impresses Ines with his magic. His rooster crows and topples a small outhouse. His dog barks and the outhouse is rebuilt. Ines invites him to the house where the rooster acts as Lam-ang&rsquo;s spokesperson. Ines&rsquo;s parents ask for a bride-price, which Lam-ang agrees to give. Lam-ang returns home to prepare for the wedding and the presents. He and his townsfolk sail on two golden ships to Kalanutian where Lam-ang and Ines have a Catholic wedding. The townspeople board the two ships to Nalbuan, Lam-ang&rsquo;s birthplace, to continue the celebration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the celebration, the barangay chief reminds Lam-ang it is his turn to hunt the <i>rarang</i>,<i> </i>a giant shellfish. Lam-ang agrees and is swallowed by the giant fish <i>berkakang</i>,<i> </i>as an earlier dream has foretold. However, a diver recovers his bones.

Leopoldo Y. Yabes made a composite edition, combining episodes from all previous versions in 1935. He also added some episodes absent from the previous editions; his version is 11 stanzas longer.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5466\">Bienvenido L. Lumbera</a>. Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This collection of 103 poems, written between 1956 and 1992, is divided into three sections: &ldquo;Paghihintay (1956-1963)&rdquo; (Waiting [1956-1963]), &ldquo;Paroo&rsquo;t Parito (1964-1970)&rdquo; (Hither and Thither [1964-1970]), and &ldquo;Paglingon at Pagtanaw (1971-1992)&rdquo; (Looking Back and Gazing [1971-1992]). The second section, &ldquo;Paroo&rsquo;t Parito,&rdquo; is further grouped into poems in English, subtitled &ldquo;Pandarayuhan&rdquo; (Foreign) and Filipino, subtitled &ldquo;Sa Sariling Wika&rdquo; (In My Own Language). The section headings frame the anthology as interconnected moments that, together, suggest a life of alternating stillness and movement, journeys, and defining moments leading to illumination worth giving one&rsquo;s life for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The influence of modernist tenets&mdash;of irony, detachment, and restraint&mdash;is discernible in the poems written in the 1950s and 1960s, when Lumbera was a graduate student at Indiana University and a young instructor. In &ldquo;Anghel na Bato&rdquo; (Angel of Stone), the persona notes the paradoxical nature of a stone angel, its immobile features holding numerous secrets; but the persona concludes that mystery, after all, is preferable to revelation. &ldquo;Sangkusing na Awit para kay Gustav Mahler&rdquo; (Half-Penny Song for Gustav Mahler) is a conceit representing the gradual dissolution of love, which the persona rues. Images of autumn dissolving into winter are the bare, abandoned trees and a beggar wind stretching out its bony hand for a silver-colored raindrop that quickly dissolves on its palm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lumbera&rsquo;s years abroad and the accompanying sense of estrangement they engendered shape a number of his poems, like &ldquo;Habang Pinanununghan ang Lake Mendota&rdquo; (On the Way to Lake Mendota), &ldquo;Pahimakas sa Isang Panahon&rdquo; (Farewell to One Season), &ldquo;Taglagas sa Bloomington&rdquo; (Autumn in Bloomington), &ldquo;Dialogue in Autumn,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pedagogy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Innkeeper Advises K.&rdquo; Remembered scenes from home intensify the longing, but this is camouflaged by irony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His hometown Lipa figures in &ldquo;Umaga sa Lipa&rdquo; (Morning in Lipa), &ldquo;Agaw-dilim sa Lipa&rdquo; (Dusk in Lipa), &ldquo;Biyahe&rdquo; (Trip), and &ldquo;Pakikipaglibing&rdquo; (Commiseration), where the scenes and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> of life are fondly remembered not in an orgy of colors but in carefully measured doses of subtle imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collection also features some of Lumbera&rsquo;s often anthologized depictions of the massive poverty, the lethal ugliness of the city, and the tyranny of its idle rich. In such poems, Lumbera displays ironic detachment, steely composure, restraint, and even humor, as evident in his apparent delight at the sight of pesky cockroaches crushed in a &ldquo;painless death&rdquo; in &ldquo;Eulogy of Roaches.&rdquo; The playfully ironic tone does not, however, hide the ugliness of the plight of children playing along Recto Ave in &ldquo;Voyagers on Recto Avenue,&rdquo; or the burden placed on helpless ordinary people in &ldquo;Ayos Lang ang Buhay sa Maynila&rdquo; (Life in Manila Is Swell), and &ldquo;Masikip Daw ang Maynila&rdquo; (They Say It&rsquo;s Crowded in Manila), where surface impressions are belied by dark implications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poems written in the 1970s and beyond, a period of intense political struggle in which Lumbera was a committed participant, advance a nationalist cause. The first three poems are ballads in response to key events: the series of rallies staged against the Marcos dictatorship, the Corazon Aquino government, and the American military bases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another dimension of the poet is revealed in a group of poems&mdash;as librettist of some of the most important and acclaimed theatrical productions: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/193\"><strong>Tales of the Manuvu</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Ang Palabas Bukas</i></b><i> </i>(Tomorrow&rsquo;s Show), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/182\"><strong>Rama, Hari</strong></a> </i></b>(Rama, The King), <b><i>Nasa Puso ang Amerika</i></b><i> </i>(America Is in the Heart), <b><i><strong>Bayani</strong></i></b><i> </i>(Hero), all of which are also powerful critiques of society. The last poems offer a glimpse of moments in the personal life of the poet. Rounding out the collection is a series of tributes to individuals: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4410\">Jose &ldquo;Ka Pepe&rdquo; Diokno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a>, Lerry Nofuente, Ka Tangkad, and Lorena Barros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modernism and Marxism have shaped Lumbera&rsquo;s poetry, a fact which demonstrates that aesthetics and politics are intimately connected, or that art is inextricable from history and ideology. Lumbera achieves this synthesis by the unwavering spirit of nationalism pervading these poems, which he wrote in a span of four decades. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

In &#x201C;Anghel na Bato&#x201D; (Angel of Stone), the persona notes the paradoxical nature of a stone angel, its immobile features holding numerous secrets; but the persona concludes that mystery, after all, is preferable to revelation. &#x201C;Sangkusing na Awit para kay Gustav Mahler&#x201D; (Half-Penny Song for Gustav Mahler) is a conceit representing the gradual dissolution of love, which the persona rues. Images of autumn dissolving into winter are the bare, abandoned trees and a beggar wind stretching out its bony hand for a silver-colored raindrop that quickly dissolves on its palm."

The 980-stanza pasyon was first published as the second part of Villacastin&rsquo;s book of prayers. The first part of the book is based on Tomas de Villacastin&rsquo;s <b><i>Recomendacion del Alma</i></b> (Recommendations for the Soul [of the Dying]), 1613.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Mahal na Passion</i></b> was written for the use of the <i>magpapahesus</i>, Filipinos organized and trained by the Spanish friars and missionaries to assist their fellow Christians at the moment of death. This pasyon was apparently also chanted during the wake. As such, it was an exposition on the spiritual import of dying as a Christian. The text exhorts the Christian to remain faithful to Christ until death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pasyon is structured according to the journey of Jesus Christ from his Last Supper with his apostles until his death on the cross and subsequent resurrection. Arrayed along the path he takes are different figures who symbolize the possible attitudes the Christian may have toward Jesus. There are Judas who betrays him, and Peter who, out of weakness, loses faith in Jesus and denies him. There is the ever faithful Mary, his mother. There, too, is Longinus who in the beginning is an enemy of Jesus but who gets converted when he witnesses the miracle of the resurrection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The narrative about the last days of Jesus Christ on earth is interspersed with <b>aral</b> (moral lessons) serving as guidelines to a Christian way of life. Their simple message is fidelity to Jesus Christ as the foundation of bliss and salvation. The world with all its allurements is mere &ldquo;papel na palara&rdquo; (tinsel), which easily crumples.

The poetic quality comes from the writer&rsquo;s sensuous visual imagination, deep psychological insights, and expert use of rhyme and meter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 18th century, the <b><i>Mahal na Passion</i></b> saw at least five printings, the 1760 edition being called &ldquo;quinta impression.&rdquo; Whether there was another printing in the 18th century is uncertain; however, inventory of the Jesuit Press, Imprenta de la Compa&ntilde;ia in 1768, states that there about 1,000 copies of the work, some bound and others unbound.

He had brought the copies to the binder. The copies of the text were sequestered by the government. The <b><i>Mahal na Passion</i></b> disappeared from the public for a while, but in 1846 an edition of the text was published in Manila by the Imprenta de los Amigos del Pais. The initiative for reprinting came from a layperson, Miguel Valdibia, who requested the <i>juez provisor</i> or ecclesiastical judge of the Archdiocese of Manila to allow a reprinting of the pasyon popularly known as &ldquo;de los cuatro evangelistas&rdquo; (the four evangelists). The appointed ecclesiastical censor, Fr Hilarion Diez, OSA, explains that the name came from the fact that early editions of the text had a frontispiece illustration depicting the four evangelists. Diez had high praises for the text, saying that it was well-written in Tagalog, derived from the gospels themselves, and had sound doctrines and exhortations adapted to daily life. He praised the &ldquo;energy of the poetic genius [of the writer of the pasyon] as comparable to Virgil&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the censor&rsquo;s praise, the title page erroneously described the pasyon as a translation by Aquino de Belen of Villacastin&rsquo;s original.

In fact,&nbsp;<b><i>Recomendacion&nbsp;</i></b>was no longer included in the 1846 edition; the&nbsp;<b><i>Mahal na Passion&nbsp;</i></b>had become an independent work.The question arises: how could the publisher of the 1846 edition have fallen into such error given that both the 1760 and 1846 editions print the approbation given by the ecclesiastical censor, Fr Antonio de Mancilla, SJ, stating that Aquino de Belen has explained in an elegant style the Passion of Christ our Lord, and that for this reason, his compatriots owe him a debt of gratitude for spreading the light of the Gospel through such a work?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This 1846 or other 19th-century edition still unknown of Aquino de Belen may have been the source from which a 19th-century <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> version was derived. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Rene Javellana</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Balmaseda, Julian Cruz.

Quezon City: Philippine Folklore Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Juan R. Francisco came across a <i>madrasa </i>(or the Romanized transliteration of the Maranao Arabic writing) of the story of <b><i><strong>Maharadia Lawana</strong></i></b> in 1968. It is a long <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> tale in prose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Maharadia Lawana, the eight- or seven-headed son of the sultan of Pulu Bandiarmasir, is exiled by his father because his rumor-mongering habit wreaks havoc among the people. He reaches an island, where Diabarail (Angel Gabriel) stops him from committing suicide and tells him that the only instrument that can kill him is a tool sharpened with the whetstone in the palace of Bandiarmasir. Maharadia Lawana then finds his way back to Bandiarmasir, and he is taken back by his parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radia Mangandiri and Radia Mangawarna, sons of the sultan of Agama Niog, prepare for a 10-year journey by boat, to win the hand of the incomparably beautiful Tuwan Potre Malano Tihaia, daughter of the sultan and sultaness of Pulu Nabandai across the sea. But the ship is battered by giant waves, and the two brothers, who are the only survivors, are swept to the island of their destination, where an old woman, Kabaian, rescues them and takes them under her wing. Soon, the two brothers hear that Tuwan Potre&rsquo;s father, the sultan, is offering her hand in marriage to anyone who will win a <i>sipa</i> (kickball) contest at a festival that the royal family is sponsoring. The two brothers set out to join the contest, and the older brother Mangandiri wins when the ball that he kicks reaches the princess&rsquo;s room. She places her ring, handkerchief, and betel nut case inside the ball, and these become tokens by which the sipa winner may be identified. Mangandiri takes the ball with the princess&rsquo;s things but he and his brother quietly slip out of the crowd and return home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One day the sultan goes for a walk and catches sight of his daughter&rsquo;s things in Kabaian&rsquo;s house. Mangandiri serves him betel nut, and he recognizes his daughter&rsquo;s ring on the young man&rsquo;s finger. He takes the younger man back to his palace to marry his daughter. However, before Mangandiri can wed the princess, her mother the sultaness imposes another condition&mdash;that he kill the giant snake residing on the mountain in the east and thus blocking the sun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The brothers kill the snake and return to Nabandai. The sultaness waits seven days for proof of the snake&rsquo;s death. On the seventh day, the stench is so strong the brothers must remove the snake. After another seven days, the sun finally appears and shines brightly, and the wedding takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Time passes. Mangandiri longs for Agama Niog and his parents. Tuwan Potre&rsquo;s father prevails upon the couple to travel by land instead of crossing the perilous sea. The caravan stops at a fertile area, and they decide to settle there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One afternoon, they spot a golden-horned deer. After giving his younger brother Mangawarna strict orders to look after his wife, Mangandiri goes after the deer but it injures him. He seeks Mangawarna&rsquo;s help. Making sure that Tuwan Potre is securely inside their house and admonishing her not to open the door to anyone under any circumstances, Mangawarna reluctantly joins the chase. When darkness falls, the deer splits into two and so the brothers split up to go after the two deer. But both deer disappear. They return home to find the house destroyed and Tuwan Potre gone. They realize that the deer is Maharadia Lawana in disguise, and he has taken Tuwan Potre.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mangawarna goes in search of his brother, and with some difficulty finds his brother asleep in the forest. Mangandiri is dreaming that a carabao has gored him, throwing one of his testicles to the east, where the Queen of the East, Potre Langawi, swallows it, thinking it is a precious stone. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a monkey named Laksamana. Mangandiri awakes and realizes that he indeed is missing one testicle. A weeping Mangawarna tells him Tuwan Potre has been taken by Maharadia Lawana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Drawn by a red light in the west, Laksamana, Mangandiri&rsquo;s monkey son, leaps from tree to tree to find it, and he finds the two brothers. Mangandiri tells him of Maharadia Lawana&rsquo;s treachery, and Laksamana proceeds to help. He calls for his subjects, the carabaos in the forest, and everyone builds a rattan bridge toward Bandiarmasir. As they cross the bridge, they fall into the crocodile-infested sea. Laksamana defeats the king of the crocodiles, who then become his subjects. Laksamana goes to the palace of Bandiarmasir, where a festival is being held to console Tuwan Potre because every time Maharadia Lawana tries to approach her, a wall of fire appears between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A battle ensues between Maharadia Lawana and the two brothers, but they cannot even wound their adversary. Laksamana takes Mangandiri&rsquo;s <i>kampilan</i>, sharpens it on the whetstone in the palace, and gives it to his uncle Mangawarna, who suddenly defeats Maharadia Lawana. Triumphantly, Tuwan Potre, Mangandiri, Mangawarna, and Laksamana journey back to Agama Niog on the mountain-like back of the king of crocodiles. The crocodiles and carabaos escort them. The people of Nagama Niog are terrified by the sight of the strange entourage. So Laksamana assures them it is the return of the two princes with the princess of Nabandai. Fear turns to joy, and a festival is held. Laksamana transforms into a very handsome datu. Happiness reigns in Agama Niog. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Efmer Agustin</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

In his expressed desire to present Philippine poetry with a national scope, Almario includes poetry in the non-Tagalog Philippine languages, including that in the two colonial languages, Spanish and English, and provides translations in Filipino of non-Tagalog poems. However, the languages of the poems are not identified. Moreover, throughout the book, Almario spells the word <i>Pilipinas</i> (Philippines) as &ldquo;Filipinas,&rdquo; and <i>Pilipino</i> (Filipino person) as &ldquo;Filipino,&rdquo; the use of &ldquo;F&rdquo; being his personal preference. There is a significant increase in the number of female poets from one (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5470\">Elynia Mabanglo</a>) in the first edition to 16 in this edition. Tagalog poets who were in the first edition but excluded here are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2725\">Reuel Aguila</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5042\">Aurelio Angeles</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3186\">Nonilon Quea&ntilde;o</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5699\">Aniceto F.

The first period (1900-1932) opens, aptly enough, with two poems in Spanish by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5051\">Cecilio Apostol</a>. Others in this language are by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5117\">Manuel Bernabe</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5348\">Fernando Ma. Guerrero</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5627\">Claro Recto</a>. Poems in non-Tagalog Philippine languages are those in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> by Mariano Goyena del Prado; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5142\">Fernando Buyser</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3137\">Amando Osorio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5622\">Vicente Ranudo</a>; Hiligaynon by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5396\">Magdalena Jalandoni</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5797\">Flavio Zaragoza-Cano</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5592\">Leon Picha</a>y; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5382\">Zoilo Hilari</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5382\">o</a>; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5479\">Eduardo Makabenta</a>. The poets in English in this period are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5208\">Amador Daguio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5722\">Trinidad Tarrosa-Subido</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5799\">Rafael Zulueta da Costa</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Almario continues to use the term &ldquo;balagtasismo&rdquo; to explain the poetics of this period&rsquo;s non-Tagalog poems, which he observes bear the same traditionalist and nationalistic spirit of balagtasismo. Indeed, the poems of this period express this common spirit in scenic descriptions of nature and the countryside, Filipino customs and habits, peasants and workers, and national symbols like the flag and the molave tree; in political satire and allegory; and in philosophical reflections in the context of Philippine relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second section shows linguistic innovation thriving in the poetry in English, as seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5043\">Carlos Angeles</a>&rsquo;s synesthesia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5252\">Ricaredo Demetillo</a>&rsquo;s metaphysical conceits, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5386\">Alejandro Hufana</a>&rsquo;s surrealism, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>&rsquo;s avant-gardism. The female poets <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5336\">Angela Manalang-Gloria</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5522\">Virginia Moreno</a> assert their female persona&rsquo;s power and defiance. In contrast, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5472\">Diosdado P. Macapagal</a>&rsquo;s Kapampangan poem of rural courtship still places the coy maiden and her bashful suitor at the public faucet; but <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5638\">Godofredo S. Reyes</a>&rsquo;s Ilocano love poem is a conceit likening the beloved&rsquo;s heart to a prison and building up to an ironic conclusion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the third period, there are 35 Tagalog poets, the new ones numbering 15, who include three women: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5049\">Rebecca A&ntilde;onuevo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5094\">Joi Barrios</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5685\">Benilda Santos</a>. The poets in English number 30 in all, starting alphabetically from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/4997\">Gemino H. Abad</a>, ending with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5794\">Alfred Yuson</a>, and including nine women. Almario notes the preoccupation with interiority in what he calls the &ldquo;esoteric allusions&rdquo; of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5050\">Roberto A&ntilde;onuevo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5103\">Cirilo F. Bautista</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5603\">Allan Popa</a>; and the depiction of extremely subjective reality by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5728\">Edith Tiempo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5241\">Ricardo de Ungria</a>, and Benilda Santos. The continuity of the Balagtas tradition is evident in the subject matter of the poems in the other languages, although technique is more complex and sentiment is withheld: a woman undressing by the sea, in Cebuano by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5038\">Rene Amper</a>; love in multilayered metaphors, in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5175\">Melchor Cichon</a> and in Cebuano by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5155\">Junne Canizares</a>; the prostitute&rsquo;s double life, in Hiligaynon by Allain Russ Dimzon; a Philippine Armageddon, in Ilocano by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5378\">Juan S. P. Hidalgo Jr</a>; an irreverent paean to a lady love, in Bikol by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5581\">Francisco Pe&ntilde;ones Jr</a>; and the city-and-countryside dichotomy, in Waray by Victor Sugbo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the anthology is meant to unify the various languages of Philippine poetry into one national literature by means of one national language, there are quite a few mistranslations that cannot be dismissed as a matter of interpretation. In Macapagal&rsquo;s Kapampangan poem, &ldquo;inugse&rdquo; (threw away) is translated as &ldquo;ubusin&rdquo; (consume); in Villa&rsquo;s poem, the intransitive verb &ldquo;lay&rdquo; (<i>nahiga</i>) is translated as the transitive verb &ldquo;inihiga&rdquo; (laid); in Demetillo&rsquo;s poem, the phrase &ldquo;lean out&rdquo; (<i>dumungaw</i>) is translated as &ldquo;kinikilingan&rdquo; (being leaned on), and &ldquo;glancing on&rdquo; (<i>dumadaplis</i>) is translated as &ldquo;sumusulyap&rdquo; (glancing at). Therefore, anyone relying solely on the translations would do well to consult someone knowledgeable in the language of the original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All in all, these two books allow readers to see the sweep of Philippine poetry&mdash;a stream with balagtasismo as its wellspring, enlarged and enriched over the decades by the currents and cross-currents of modernism, formalism, feminism, and other such literary trends and movements. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a>, and Rebecca T.

Poems in non-Tagalog Philippine languages are those in <a href=\"/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> by Mariano Goyena del Prado; <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> by <a href=\"/9/9/5142\">Fernando Buyser</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/3137\">Amando Osorio</a>, and <a href=\"/9/9/5622\">Vicente Ranudo</a>; Hiligaynon by <a href=\"/9/9/5396\">Magdalena Jalandoni</a> and <a href=\"/9/9/5797\">Flavio Zaragoza-Cano</a>; <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> by <a href=\"/9/9/5592\">Leon Picha</a>y; <a href=\"/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a> by <a href=\"/9/9/5382\">Zoilo Hilari</a><a href=\"/9/9/5382\">o</a>; and <a href=\"/1/2/2379\">Waray</a> by <a href=\"/9/9/5479\">Eduardo Makabenta</a>. The poets in English in this period are <a href=\"/9/9/5208\">Amador Daguio</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5722\">Trinidad Tarrosa-Subido</a>, and <a href=\"/9/9/5799\">Rafael Zulueta da Costa</a>."

Indeed, the poems of this period express this common spirit in scenic descriptions of nature and the countryside, Filipino customs and habits, peasants and workers, and national symbols like the flag and the molave tree; in political satire and allegory; and in philosophical reflections in the context of Philippine relationships."

The female poets <a href=\"/9/9/5336\">Angela Manalang-Gloria</a> and <a href=\"/9/9/5522\">Virginia Moreno</a> assert their female persona&#x2019;s power and defiance. In contrast, <a href=\"/9/9/5472\">Diosdado P. Macapagal</a>&#x2019;s Kapampangan poem of rural courtship still places the coy maiden and her bashful suitor at the public faucet; but <a href=\"/9/9/5638\">Godofredo S. Reyes</a>&#x2019;s Ilocano love poem is a conceit likening the beloved&#x2019;s heart to a prison and building up to an ironic conclusion."

The poets in English number 30 in all, starting alphabetically from <a href=\"/9/9/4997\">Gemino H. Abad</a>, ending with <a href=\"/9/9/5794\">Alfred Yuson</a>, and including nine women. Almario notes the preoccupation with interiority in what he calls the &#x201C;esoteric allusions&#x201D; of <a href=\"/9/9/5050\">Roberto A&#xF1;onuevo</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5103\">Cirilo F. Bautista</a>, and <a href=\"/9/9/5603\">Allan Popa</a>; and the depiction of extremely subjective reality by <a href=\"/9/9/5728\">Edith Tiempo</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5241\">Ricardo de Ungria</a>, and Benilda Santos. The continuity of the Balagtas tradition is evident in the subject matter of the poems in the other languages, although technique is more complex and sentiment is withheld: a woman undressing by the sea, in Cebuano by <a href=\"/9/9/5038\">Rene Amper</a>; love in multilayered metaphors, in <a href=\"/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a> by <a href=\"/9/9/5175\">Melchor Cichon</a> and in Cebuano by <a href=\"/9/9/5155\">Junne Canizares</a>; the prostitute&#x2019;s double life, in Hiligaynon by Allain Russ Dimzon; a Philippine Armageddon, in Ilocano by <a href=\"/9/9/5378\">Juan S. P. Hidalgo Jr</a>; an irreverent paean to a lady love, in Bikol by <a href=\"/9/9/5581\">Francisco Pe&#xF1;ones Jr</a>; and the city-and-countryside dichotomy, in Waray by Victor Sugbo."

In Macapagal&#x2019;s Kapampangan poem, &#x201C;inugse&#x201D; (threw away) is translated as &#x201C;ubusin&#x201D; (consume); in Villa&#x2019;s poem, the intransitive verb &#x201C;lay&#x201D; (<i>nahiga</i>) is translated as the transitive verb &#x201C;inihiga&#x201D; (laid); in Demetillo&#x2019;s poem, the phrase &#x201C;lean out&#x201D; (<i>dumungaw</i>) is translated as &#x201C;kinikilingan&#x201D; (being leaned on), and &#x201C;glancing on&#x201D; (<i>dumadaplis</i>) is translated as &#x201C;sumusulyap&#x201D; (glancing at).

The poems portray life in his coastal hometown of Barugo with both affection and irony. Oyzon&rsquo;s poetry represents a new direction that may be taken by the contemporary <b>siday</b>,<b> </b>which tends to be critical and didactic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The title poem approaches its theme through the persona of a drunk whose singular object in life is to keep himself soused and then to pick a fight and land in jail. In a half-humorous and ironical way, Oyzon decries the idleness and drinking common in rural Waray communities. In the same vein is &ldquo;An Paghugos ni &rsquo;Tay Gayok kan Man&rsquo; Uyik nga Parahubog&rdquo; (&rsquo;Tay Gayok Brings the Sot, Mano Uyik, to His Grave). Man&rsquo; Uyik, wrapped in a mat, gets no elaborate send off, only the tolling of the church bell and the lone mourner leaving quickly for a cockfight where he is to serve as the referee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poet casts a critical eye on social and political issues. &ldquo;Hi Salvador Magsusundalo&rdquo; (Salvador Will Enter the Army) tells of a young man who joins the military in order to escape starvation but who is coldly aware that he could die just as well from a bullet&mdash;a comment on social injustice in the countryside. In &ldquo;Pagbarol&rdquo; (Drying Fish), a young woman is splitting fish for drying when two American soldiers come upon her and rape her, a scene symbolizing the entry of the American occupation forces in Balangiga, Samar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oyzon&rsquo;s poetry departs from the established tradition of the siday,<i> </i>which observes meter and rhyme and the pattern of the quatrain. Written in free verse, the poems show how seamlessly the Waray idiom adapts to the usage of contemporary poetics. They also demonstrate Oyzon&rsquo;s understanding of contemporary poetic craft and his skill at using them. In<i> </i>&ldquo;Pangadi Human Kumarawat hin Bangaw&rdquo; (Prayer after Receiving Alms), Oyzon&rsquo;s persona thanks God for the gift of a piece of rice cake, <i>biko</i>.<i> </i>The host carefully distributes <i>bangaw</i>,<i> </i>or food offering after a prayer or procession, so that each one is served; but gate-crashers, the other meaning of the word, look to have a share of the banquet. The wordplay is the means for a wry and humorous complaint against social and divine injustice. Such irony as Oyzon practices is typical of the Waray attitude.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oyzon is also capable of tenderness and lyricism. The persona in &ldquo;Buklara an Imo mga Palad&rdquo; (Open Your Hands) tells the reader that to hold something beautiful and precious like a white dove, one lets it come freely into one&rsquo;s hands; then when it is ready to leave, one opens one&rsquo;s hands to let it fly free. In &ldquo;Pagtambal ni Apoy Kuwa han Piol ni Anling, an Iya Olitawohay nga Apo&rdquo; (Apoy Kuwa Invents a Cure for Young Anling&rsquo;s Broken Heart),<i> </i>an old woman comforts a young man in the throes of his first heartbreak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The many voices that speak in this book are authentic voices of the Waray. The poems demonstrate Oyzon&rsquo;s mastery of the idioms of his people. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><strong>Merlie M.

In<i> </i>&#x201C;Pangadi Human Kumarawat hin Bangaw&#x201D; (Prayer after Receiving Alms), Oyzon&#x2019;s persona thanks God for the gift of a piece of rice cake, <i>biko</i>.<i> </i>The host carefully distributes <i>bangaw</i>,<i> </i>or food offering after a prayer or procession, so that each one is served; but gate-crashers, the other meaning of the word, look to have a share of the banquet. The wordplay is the means for a wry and humorous complaint against social and divine injustice. Such irony as Oyzon practices is typical of the Waray attitude."

In &#x201C;Pagtambal ni Apoy Kuwa han Piol ni Anling, an Iya Olitawohay nga Apo&#x201D; (Apoy Kuwa Invents a Cure for Young Anling&#x2019;s Broken Heart),<i> </i>an old woman comforts a young man in the throes of his first heartbreak."

Palma&rsquo;s love for Florentina Arellano, his colleague in <b><i>La</i></b><i> <b><strong>Independencia</strong></b></i>,<i> </i>the newspaper of the Philippine Revolution of 1898, led to the writing of a series of romantic poems, which express his desire and frustration: &ldquo;Mi Regalo de Fiesta&rdquo; (My Birthday Gift), in which he offers his heart as his gift; &ldquo;En Confianza&rdquo; (In Confidence); &ldquo;Ella!&rdquo; (She); and &ldquo;Tu Nido&rdquo; (Your Nest).

Francisca &ldquo;Bebs&rdquo; C. Custodio, the morning newscaster, started the habit of reading an appropriate quotation in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a> after each newscast. In 1980, after nearly a year of this practice, Custodio invited her listeners to send in quotations of their own. She received not just quotations but complete poems. Some of these poems were probably original compositions, but a number might have been poems or composites of well-loved lines by older writers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3063\">Iluminado Lucente</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5479\">Eduardo Makabenta</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5244\">Vicente de Veyr</a>a&mdash;a situation typical of a language community whose literature remains largely oral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">So popular did <b><i>Puplonganon</i></b> become that DYVL eventually gave it its own airtime after the seven o&rsquo;clock news. More interest was raised by making it into a contest. Winners of the contest were judged on the aptness of their commentary on the burning issues of the day. Poetic prowess was only a secondary consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The DYVL <b><i>Puplonganon</i></b><i> </i>remains the most reliable and popular literary venue in the region to this day. The book is a result of this realization. The works of 54 poets were selected from the winning entries. An introductory essay describes aspects of the <b>siday</b> canon as practiced by Makabenta and Lucente. At least 10 poets have more than one poem in the book, evidence of the frequency of their participation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">True to its role as news commentary, the DYVL <b><i>Puplonganon</i> </b>deals with such mundane themes as the error of attending a fiesta banquet on a working day in Ambrosio Canarias&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pamatron&rdquo; (Attending a Fiesta); the proper way of bringing up a child in Kenneth John Dapunan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pagpadako nga Matadong&rdquo; (Bringing Up Children); destructive envy or jealousy in Norberto Nabablit&rsquo;s &ldquo;Crab Mentality&rdquo;; the best way to deal with women in John B. Simborios&rsquo;s &ldquo;Babayi&rdquo; (Woman); and fatherhood in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5693\">Maximo Servidad</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Father&rsquo;s Day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rogelio Jomadiao, probably the most technically gifted among the DYVL poets, plies his metrics and his rhyme with virtuoso ease. However, he has yet to rise to insight and logical control, poetic traits that one may find in works of such writers as de Veyra and Lucente.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Writing and reading in Waray became the domain of the grassroots functioning mainly from a poorly understood sense of tradition.

In 1980, after nearly a year of this practice, Custodio invited her listeners to send in quotations of their own. She received not just quotations but complete poems.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>. Anthologized in <b><i>Poesias</i></b><i> <b>de</b> <b>Rizal</b></i>,<i> </i>(Poems of Rizal) compiled by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5242\">Jaime C. de Veyra</a>, Manila: Bureau of Printing, 1946. Translations into the different local languages and into foreign languages in <b><i>Doctor</i></b><i> <b>Jose</b> <b>Rizal&rsquo;s</b> <b>Mi</b> <b>Ultimo Adios</b></i>, compiled by Regino P. Paula, Manila: National Historical Institute, 1989. Among the local languages are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>; among the foreign languages are English, French, German, Hungarian, Chinese, Swedish, and Latin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This last poem of Rizal was supposedly composed in his prison cell on the eve of his execution in 1896. In 14 rhyming quintillas or five-line stanzas, the poem is a dying person&rsquo;s stirring declaration of unwavering love for country and of solidarity with all of his patriotic country folk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the opening stanzas, the persona bids goodbye to the native land, which is addressed in glorious epithets: &ldquo;region del sol querida&rdquo; (clime of the sun carress&rsquo;d) and &ldquo;nuestro perdido Eden&rdquo; (our Eden lost). Declared are the persona&rsquo;s final hopes: that the country folk remember the persona even in death and that they pray for those who, like the speaker, fought for the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No bitterness at the prospect of death is expressed. Instead, with the knowledge that the death is not for naught but for the nation, there is calm resignation (trans. Charles Derbyshire):</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&hellip; &iexcl;ah, que es hermoso caer por darte vuelo,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">morir por darte vida, morir bajo tu cielo,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">y en tu encantada tierra la eternidad dormir!</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(&hellip; sweet it is for thee to expire,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To die for thy sake, that thou mayst aspire,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">And sleep in thy bosom eternity&rsquo;s long night!)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The persona&rsquo;s only desire is that &ldquo;mis cenizas, antes que vuelvan a la nada, / el polvo de tu alfombra que vayan a formar&rdquo; (my ashes may carpet thy earthy floor, / Before into nothingness at last they are blown).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paradoxically, the end of the persona&rsquo;s own life will mark the beginning of a new life for the country, a dawn.

Chanter, Baket Anag of Maraburab, Alcala, Cagayan. Transcriber and translator, Ernesto Constantino. With a preface by Tsunekazi Moriguchi. Kyoto: Nakanishi Printing Co., Ltd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Labin Agta Negritos of Cagayan province have an epic poem called <b><i>Nanang</i></b>. The word <b>nanang</b> is also their term for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> poetry. In 1977, Ernesto Constantino recorded Baket Anag as she chanted four cycles, or songs, of the nanang, the first of which he titled &ldquo;The Abduction and Wedding of Two Maidens.&rdquo; The second recorded cycle is <b><i>Nanang: I Taguwasi anna i Innawagan</i></b> (Epic: Taguwasi and Innawagan), although this cycle was published first, in 2001. The two remaining cycles have yet to be transcribed and translated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The cycle titled &ldquo;The Abduction and Wedding of Two Maidens&rdquo; can be divided into four episodes, each one centering on an abduction: that of Kabugnayan, of the men, of the women, and finally, of Dappit ya Danum. Thus, despite its title, there are actually four abductions. In the first part of this cycle, Ammani is the hero who rescues the abducted maiden, Kabugnayan. He is later aided by Kabugnayan&rsquo;s brothers, Talimanog and Annibo. Talimanog and Ammani&rsquo;s sister, Alig, are wed; and so are Ammani and Kabugnayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The narrative opens with Ammani asking his sister, Alig, for betel chew before he goes roaming in the sky. Elsewhere, Talimanog asks his sister, Innawagan, the same. Both are gone for years. When Ammani returns, he calls Alig from the yard, and she bids him come into the house. Inside the house, Ammani repairs his spear at the corner of his window but does not take the seat made of pure gold. Ammani asks Alig to make him a betel chew. As Alig splits the betel nut, it cries out with pain. It tells them that its mistress, Kabugnayan, has sent for help because she has been abducted by the big bird, Bannug. Her abductor is forcing her into marriage but, in the meantime, she is being made to clean her abductor&rsquo;s yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ammani flies off to rescue the abducted maiden. He fights with Pane Nagdombilan, who bars his way at the golden door at the foot of the sky. Ammani summons his <i>angin</i> (inner power) from his G-string. On the fifth try, Ammani finally smashes the door with his angin&rsquo;s help, and he searches for Bannug. It is at the foot of the sky but the maiden&rsquo;s abductor, Pane Tatallapan, is at the tenth layer of the sky, where there is great rejoicing because Tatallapan is about to wed the abducted maiden. Ammani assures Tatallapan he comes with good intentions, so Tatallapan offers him a scoop of wine. Ammani introduces himself as Ammani from Donglayon. The wedding guests are suddenly very still.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Talimanog and Annnibo, who have been walking by the river, stop at Alig&rsquo;s front yard. She asks them to look for her brother, Ammani. Ammani has gained entry into Pane Tatallapan&rsquo;s house and finds Kabugnayan, the abducted maiden, underneath a blanket. Ammani tries to persuade her to let him take her to his home in Idonglayong but she hesitates in fear of Pane Tatallapan&rsquo;s anger. When she finally escapes with him, he happily walks out dancing. Triumphantly, he throws and breaks Tatallapan&rsquo;s jar of wine, and Tatallapan&rsquo;s coconut shell rolls on the floor. Tatallapan is angered by Ammani&rsquo;s deception. Ammani warns Kabugnayan to shield herself behind Pane Tatallapan&rsquo;s house before he releases his angin in a duel with Tatallapan. Ammani wins the duel. Kabugnayan lights up the foot of the sky with &ldquo;the side of her midriff&rdquo; as they travel back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ammani and Kabugnayan arrive at the place of her brother, Talimanog. Pane Tatallapan comes roaring into the scene, and the men engage him in battle. Annibo orders his spear to strike Tatallapan. Kabugnayan is standing quietly where they are fighting. Ammani asks Kabugnayan to light up the river of Idonglayon. She flies up and causes the river to overflow and drown the pursuers. Ammani hacks at them. He takes Tatallapan&rsquo;s head by the hair, preparing to behead him. Talimanog restrains Ammani, pointing out that the enemy has begged for mercy. Ammani makes Tatallapan ask for forgiveness but Tatallapan stands up and wishes only for his strength back. Ammani and Talimanog arrive at Alig&rsquo;s front yard with Kabugnayan, and Alig bids them come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is Talimanog&rsquo;s wedding day. Alig and the people of Nagdombilan are shouting with joy as they gather in Talimanog&rsquo;s house. Kabugnayan, Asisigtan, and Dappit ya Danum are there. Talimanog makes sure that the chairs are facing each other. In a ceremonious expression of exaggerated humility, he asks the ladies to hack him with their bolos and throw his body in the front yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kabugnayan gifts Alig, now her sister-in-law, with items of apparel, jewelry, and perfume. All the guests, including Pane Nagdombilan and the people of Nagdombilan, each give her a similar set of gifts. They call on Inalay-ayan, the ruler of rainbows, to light up the sky. More guests arrive, including Pane Tatallapan. Talimanog asks Kabugnayan to sit on a chair beside Ammani. Dappit ya Danum wishes for nightfall, and Inalay-ayan reproaches her for covering him with night. Talimanog offers Inalay-ayan and Pane Nagtunungan their seats. Kabugnayan asks Ammani to split a betel nut for the guests&rsquo; betel chews, but Ammani needs only a single betel nut to multiply itself for all the guests. Kabugnayan, the bride, serves betel chews to the guests and returns to Ammani&rsquo;s side. Everyone is shouting with joy. Pane Paglebut ya Langit wishes them well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The servant worries that not all the wine will be consumed, so Ammani drinks it all up. Gawan plays the <i>tongatong</i> (bamboo musical instrument), Indaw plays the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>, Diparong dances, and Karanayan joins him. Everyone joins in the dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second part opens with the Kinallinga (enemies) yelling at the foot of the sky. Paguyyawi orders Kanikan (giant python) to capture all the bachelors. Makindaranum (crocodile) will abduct all the maidens. Makindaranum pulls the bachelors away with his tail. At sunset, Kanikan emerges roaring from the riverbank, and passes by the pomelo and banana plantations. It enters the house and swallows up Pane Nagdombilan, Bannanayo, Ammani, Talimanog, and Inalay-ayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third abduction is by Makindaranum the crocodile, who initially threatens to swallow only Kabugnayan, but she and all the maidens sit on its back instead. With the women riding on its back, Makindaranum goes home to the &ldquo;navel of the river.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Kanikan takes its male captives to its master, Nugunug Paguyyawi, who is making decorative incisions on his spear. But the men emerge from Kanikan&rsquo;s belly. Inalay-ayan and Paguyyawi fight. Paguyyawi then hurls Diparong to the ground. He reveals that Diparong is his father, whom he resents. When his mother Karanayan was pregnant with him, the jealous Diparong had struck Karanayan while she was bathing in the river Idonglayon and had caused her to miscarry. The fetus was Paguyyawi, who floated downriver in a golden bowl, which Alig came upon and covered with fragrant leaves. Kanikan covered him with foam, which was actually Karanayan. Paguyyawi ends by calling his father the night and stating he would have died without other people&rsquo;s kindness. Talimanog is moved to tears, calls him &ldquo;allay&rdquo; (friend), and offers to let himself be killed by Paguyyawi. Paguyyawi desists, saying that it is only because of his father&rsquo;s rejection that he harbors angry thoughts. He joins the men walking cheerfully back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The story of the abduction of the women by the crocodile continues. Discovering that the women have been taken by Makindaranum, the men go to the navel of the river, and Paguyyawi commands the water to part for the women to escape through. Talimanog challenges Pusad a Danum (Navel of the River) to a fight. They wrestle by the riverbank until they bore inside the earth. Amangaw, Pusad a Danum&rsquo;s spirit, and Namutumukan, Talimanog&rsquo;s spirit, also fight. The river, having been diverted, roars and overflows. Paguyyawi calls on his mother, Karanayan, for help. Karanayan climbs up the riverbank to Talimanog&rsquo;s yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, the enemies, the Kinallinga, have arrived, vowing to kill the people of Idonglayon, whom they call liars. But the people defeat the Kinallinga, who flee. The people celebrate their victory. Inalay-ayan and Dappit ya Danum dance to the music of Gawan&rsquo;s tongatong and Indaw&rsquo;s gong. Inalay-ayan asks Dappit for betel chew. She gives it to him, and Inalay-ayan exclaims that he will die from her betel chew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Talimanog sends his messenger bird, Dalawesan, to Master Bullalayaw to ask him to prepare the gold that his Master Inalay-ayan needs for his wedding. Dalawesan flies through the vast skies until he tires. He lands on the shoulder of Karanayan, Inalay-ayan&rsquo;s mother, and tells her to prepare the gold for her son&rsquo;s wedding. Karanayan hurries toward Inalay-ayan&rsquo;s house, where the people have gathered for the wedding. Pane Nagdombilan puts her inside his betel chew pouch. When the men arrive at Talimanog&rsquo;s house, Karanayan emerges from the pouch, as do all the other maidens out of their pouches. Diparong is among the guests, and Talimanog welcomes him. Karanayan and Inalay-ayan reconcile with Diparong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fourth abduction is that of Dappit ya Danum during her wedding to Inalay-ayan.

He pushes his way through a place full of <i>aluwaluwa</i> vines and mist, until he reaches Pane Namansawan&rsquo;s house. He puts Dappit ya Danum in his betel chew pouch and defeats both Pane Namansawan and Bannug.

Kyoto: Nakanishi Printing Co., Ltd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Nanang </b>is the term for epic poetry among the Labin Agta Negritos of Cagayan province. <b><i>Nanang: I Taguwasi anna i Innawagan</i></b> is one episode of the nanang and the first known Philippine Negrito epic to be published, although another episode, <b><i>The Abduction and Wedding of Two Negrito Maidens</i></b>, was recorded first but published two years later, in 2003. Both were chanted by Marcela Tumbali, aka Baket Anag, in 1977 in Maraburab village in the municipality of Alcala, Cagayan. In this episode of the nanang, the heroes are three brothers named Talimanog, Ammani, and Annibo. They have two sisters, Innawagan and Alig, who play an active role in the narrative. A fourth hero, Taguwasi, becomes their brother-in-law after he helps the brothers rescue their sister, Innawagan, from her abductor. Taguwasi&rsquo;s sister, Sinag, plays a minor part in the rescue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic&rsquo;s first two lines are the chanter&rsquo;s acknowledgment of the presence of the hero Talimanog. The action begins with the lady Innawagan&rsquo;s abduction by the bird Ammalabukkaw. Innawagan is detained at the fifth layer of the sky to be someone&rsquo;s bride, presumably the sky god Pane Kalimangalnuk ya Langit. Innawagan&rsquo;s older sister Alig tasks their three brothers&mdash;Talimanog, Ammani, and Annibo&mdash;to rescue Innawagan. The three brothers fly toward the foot of the sky, lighting it up as they do so. Talimanog instructs Innawagan&rsquo;s bird Dundunan to free her but Pane Kalimangalnuk foils him. Talimanog&rsquo;s chest roars, indicating his readiness to do battle. He takes Innawagan out to &ldquo;the front yard&rdquo; of the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For many months, the three brothers take turns dueling with Kalimangalnuk ya Langit and his arrow, a metonymy for Kalimangalnuk&rsquo;s fighting prowess. Ammani falls first and then Annibo. Talimanog&rsquo;s battle with Kalimangalnuk lasts for years, but he, too, falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fearing for Talimanog, Innawagan sends Talimanog&rsquo;s bird Dalawesan to her sister Alig for help. Two thorns get in Dalawesan&rsquo;s way as he travels through the &ldquo;surroundings of the sky,&rdquo; and they taunt him to cry. When Dalawesan reaches Alig&rsquo;s place, he somersaults and perches on her shoulder. He tells Alig of his mission, and she replies that the rescuer is in the place where the sun rises. Dalawesan flies, his tail lighting up the sky. He lands at the foot of the sky but can find no opening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sinag is looking out her window, fanning herself. Dalawesan somersaults, lands, and tells her of his mission. Sinag replies that her brother might be able to help but he is out roaming the sky. She packs betel nut chew and her fragrance, a metonymy for her essence, thus her identity, for Dalawesan to give to her brother. Dalawesan sets out in search of Sinag&rsquo;s brother. He complains of fatigue from wandering all over the sky. Taguwasi, the man he seeks, is sitting and making decorative incisions on his bolo. Dalawesan flies by, fanning Taguwasi&rsquo;s face. Taguwasi introduces himself, identifying himself as &ldquo;a person,&rdquo; and Dalawesan recognizes him as the well-known warrior who will succeed where Innawagan&rsquo;s brothers have failed: to free her. He offers Innawagan&rsquo;s hand in marriage if Taguwasi succeeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taguwasi agrees to rescue Innawagan; otherwise, he says, she will be forced to marry her captor by the end of the month. Dalawesan gives Taguwasi his sister Sinag&rsquo;s betel nut chew and perfume. Taguwasi puts the chew in his mouth, declares it delicious, and is energized to go. Dalawesan again complains of extreme fatigue, perches on Taguwasi&rsquo;s shoulder, and continually pecks at Taguwasi&rsquo;s ears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the fifth layer of the sky, Pane Nagdombilan, who guards the door made of gold, blocks Taguwasi and Dalawesan. Because Pane Nagdombilan&rsquo;s eyes are made of earth, Taguwasi knows that he is &ldquo;not a person&rdquo;&mdash;that is, that Pane Nagdombilan is a supernatural creature. Taguwasi lets Dalawesan rest while he duels with Nagdombilan. He calls upon his <i>angin</i> (spirit-wind) in his G-string to strike the door made of gold, and he prays to the <i>ina nanolay</i> (Mother of Life) for help. Taguwasi&rsquo;s angin in his chest roars, but neither his arrow, brute strength, nor the wind can budge the two-layered door made of gold. Taguwasi and his angin try again until, at last, they blow the door loose. Taguwasi shuffles his feet and pulls the door up, makes it lie on its side, before he hurls it toward the place where the sun sets. Taguwasi now sends his angin to rest where the night also rests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The people exclaim how beautiful &ldquo;the front yard&rdquo; is. It is Innawagan sitting there, shining like the bright moon. But Talimanog, who has been fighting with Pane Lumutumukanin, aka Kalimangalnuk, is weakening. Taguwasi walks toward Kalimangalnuk, his head bowed and his feet heavy. Kalimangalnuk jeeringly calls him &ldquo;person&rdquo; and tells him to hurry up. Taguwasi somersaults and lands in &ldquo;the front yard.&rdquo; But Innawagan exclaims that Talimanog has died. She asks Dalawesan accusingly where her rescuer is. The bird points behind him at Taguwasi. Innawagan pleads for his pity and his help, but Taguwasi is too late, for Talimanog has died. Taguwasi reproaches them all for not waiting for him long enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With renewed energy, Taguwasi, his chest roaring, resumes his battle with Kalimangalnuk. Asisidtan, Ammani&rsquo;s sister-in-law, remarks that Taguwasi&rsquo;s chest is the source of his power but he must also guard against Kalimangalnuk&rsquo;s arrow. Taguwasi calls upon his angin and prays to Ina Nanolay to send Kalimangalnuk&rsquo;s arrow away. Again, there is a prolonged battle until Kalimangalnuk weakens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taguwasi rescues Innawagan. She ties Ammani and Annibo to her waist with her fragrance and Taguwasi grabs Talimanog. Innawagan takes Ammani&rsquo;s bolo and she shines like the moon at its fullest. With Talimanog&rsquo;s arrow, she opens up &ldquo;a crack at the foot of the sky.&rdquo; The earth cracks open and she somersaults and lands on it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taguwasi turns around and there is Kalimangalnuk again, standing before him, with his allies. Taguwasi and his angin fight Kalimangalnuk in earnest until they hurl him away. Taguwasi and his companions kill all the enemies and hang the headless corpses, which light up the sky.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taguwasi and his companions are now at Nagdombilan&rsquo;s place, but so is Kalimangalnuk. Taguwasi pushes Innawagan toward the corner of her door, promising to defeat Kalimangalnuk for certain. Innawagan is reluctant to leave him but she walks along the big river until she reaches home, aka Talimanog&rsquo;s land. The men at the orange grove catch sight of her. Taguwasi, too, is there and calls to Alig. But Kalimangalnuk reappears and fights with Taguwasi, who does not recognize him and thinks he is &ldquo;a person.&rdquo; But Kalimangalnuk reveals his name. Taguwasi beheads him, throws his corpse to the tree where Ammani hangs the dead, and throws his head away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alig invites Taguwasi up to their house, where Innawagan is waiting, and a mat made of gold is prepared for Taguwasi. The people rejoice until they realize that Ammani, Talimanog, and Annibo&rsquo;s fragrance, or spirit, is fading. Innawagan tasks the servants to prepare the mats of gold for her three brothers. Alig brings Ammani back to life by putting betel nut chew into his mouth; Aran (Ammani&rsquo;s aunt) does the same with Talimanog; and Alugasan (Annibo&rsquo;s sister-in-law) does the same with Annibo. Alig calls for the river from the &ldquo;surroundings of the sky&rdquo; to flow to the middle of the floor of the house for the three brothers to bathe in. One by one, the three brothers jump and frolic in the river and drink its water. They become fully restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Taguwasi&rsquo;s sisters&mdash;Sinag, Kabugnayan (Ammani&rsquo;s wife), Dapit ya Dannum, and Asisidtan&mdash;are searching for their brother &ldquo;in the surroundings of the sky.&rdquo; Bananayo, Tarubani, and Kadukallan join them. Talimanog is looking out the window when they reach his yard and he welcomes them in. Talimanog insists that they sit on the seats, poor though these be, instead of on the floor, like servants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rites of courtship now commence. Taguwasi&rsquo;s sisters, Asisidtan and Sinag, humble themselves before Talimanog, who in turn pretends to push them away. Then, it is Talimanog&rsquo;s turn to be Innawagan&rsquo;s spokesperson, and Sinag is Taguwasi&rsquo;s. When the marriage is approved, the people rejoice. Talimanog&rsquo;s sisters give Innawagan a dowry of skirts, a bracelet, perfume, earrings, and gold. They make her sit beside Taguwasi, and Sinag covers Innawagan with the dowry gifts, though this lasts till nighttime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Katallaritan Kinallingas, tiring of the noise, decide to attack the wedding with shields and spears. Led by Pane Namandiyanin, they travel through Talimanog&rsquo;s coconut and banana groves. On the way, they engage in battle with Nagdombilan and then Nagdugwan, both of whom they defeat. When the Kinallingas reach the wedding reception, Taguwasi defeats them with his arrow and bolo. Taguwasi cuts off the Kinallingas&rsquo; heads and throws them to the tree where the dead are hung. At last, Taguwasi and Innawagan sit side by side on the floor. The people celebrate the victory and the ladies marvel at Taguwasi&rsquo;s unsurpassed prowess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This epic will strike the reader who is not knowledgeable in its literary conventions and its cultural and metaphysical references as possessing elements of fabulation and a dreamlike structure. It is, certainly, one of the most dazzling and challenging narratives in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1536\">Philippine literature</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jay Jomar F.

Thus, despite its title, there are actually four abductions. In the first part of this cycle, Ammani is the hero who rescues the abducted maiden, Kabugnayan.

Inside the house, Ammani repairs his spear at the corner of his window but does not take the seat made of pure gold. Ammani asks Alig to make him a betel chew. As Alig splits the betel nut, it cries out with pain. It tells them that its mistress, Kabugnayan, has sent for help because she has been abducted by the big bird, Bannug.

When she finally escapes with him, he happily walks out dancing. Triumphantly, he throws and breaks Tatallapan&#x2019;s jar of wine, and Tatallapan&#x2019;s coconut shell rolls on the floor.

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemheadLIT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Transcribed 1997. Chanters, Gem-gem Bagued, Delia Jardinero, and Fernando Lingsa. Transcriber and translator, Paul D. Jagmis Sr, &ldquo;<b><i>Pala&rsquo;isgen</i></b>: Ang Epiko ng mga Tagbanua&rdquo; (<b><i>Pala&rsquo;isgen</i></b>: The Epic of the Tagbanua). PhD diss., Holy Trinity College, Puerto Princesa City, Palawan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> epic about a hero named Pala&rsquo;isgen was reconstructed from six episodes chanted by three Tagbanwa persons on separate occasions in three different barangays of the municipality of Aborlan, Palawan. The epic consists of 1,465 lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Part 1, &ldquo;Pala&rsquo;isgen Visits the People of the Earth,&rdquo; perfunctorily introduces Pala&rsquo;isgen&rsquo;s family: living on the seashore is Magreng, the father whose four sons are Buaya, the eldest; Baybayanen, the second; Pala-isgen, the third; and Liokyangan, the fourth. Pala&rsquo;isgen and Liokyangan fly above the earth in a <i>biday</i> (boat), and Pala&rsquo;isgen, seeing the world at war, orders everyone to stop fighting. Peace reigns at last. In part 2, &ldquo;Pala&rsquo;isgen Courts Tubod kat Bulawan,&rdquo; Pala&rsquo;isgen, accompanied by his brother Liokyangan, travels to Tubod kat Bulawan&rsquo;s island to court her. She tells him she will defer to her father, Letang Bato. As she says this, the sea sends large waves, and Pala&rsquo;isgen commands them to retreat so he can pass through. Letang Bato consents to the match. In part 3, &ldquo;Preparations for Pala&rsquo;isgen and Tubod&rsquo;s Wedding,&rdquo; Pala&rsquo;isgen demonstrates his magic powers as he uses his talisman to produce the most lavish wedding feast, laid on golden plates and glasses. The people speculate that he must be a <i>diwata</i> (god). In part 4, &ldquo;Letang Bato Visits Pala&rsquo;isgen and Tubod&rsquo;s Home,&rdquo; Pala&rsquo;isgen carries his father-in-law on his back as they fly to his home. Seeing the golden contents of his son-in-law&rsquo;s house, Letang Bato is satisfied that Pala&rsquo;isgen is a true Diwata.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Part 5, &ldquo;Pala&rsquo;isgen&rsquo;s Battle with the Giants,&rdquo; is a longer episode. Its narrative elements and characters seem to have been greatly influenced by the Spanish <b>corrido</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a>), which has been adapted into the Philippine <b>korido</b>. The episode opens with a quarrel between Pala&rsquo;isgen and his wife, Tubod kat Bulawan. Pala&rsquo;isgen goes for a long walk and falls asleep by a tree. In a dream, an old man tells him to go to the source of the wind, where he will receive happy news. Pala&rsquo;isgen disguises himself as a filthy, smelly beggar and changes his name to Maskinan. He returns home and discovers that a giant has taken his wife. Maskinan sits by the river contemplating how to rescue his wife when a crab tells him that a giant has taken Tubod kat Bulawan to the seventh room of a seventh mountain, and that every room is guarded by a giant. They are fattening up Tubod before they eat her. Pala&rsquo;isgen sheds his disguise, takes his kris, and whistles for a beautiful bird. The bird warns him to act only just before dawn when the giants will neither see nor smell him. Pala&rsquo;isgen kills the first six giants and, before proceeding to the seventh room, takes a nap. The old man instructs him in a dream to summon the bumblebee. The bee comes and carries Pala&rsquo;isgen to Tubod&rsquo;s prison, from where the couple fly to the place of the source of the wind. They live up on a tree and never quarrel again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Part 6, &ldquo;Pala&rsquo;isgen and His Brothers Fight with Tigre on Mt. Nanlaliban,&rdquo; is twice as long as parts 1-5 combined. Pala&rsquo;isgen woos Tubod but she wonders how he will feed her when all he knows is how to do battle. Pala&rsquo;isgen is enraged at this and transforms into a <i>santermo</i><b> </b>(Saint Elmo&rsquo;s fire), with burning eyes. Tubod wishes that he were more like Ruray Karuraynen, who is rolling in wealth. Pala&rsquo;isgen retorts that if she were a man, she would have flown out the window by now, or would be walking on the fields, with all the trees cut down by his anger. He plants the <i>antenganen</i>, the tree of life and death, in front of her house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pala&rsquo;isgen goes on a quest for his father, Biyarong-Barongan, using his kerchief for a sail, and his large dagger and kris for a helm. He flies for years, until he sights Tigre&rsquo;s kingdom sprawling in the mountains and his subjects forming a line. From the seashore to the <i>kabagtik</i> (mountain forest of almaciga trees), the doors and windows are facing one another. Pala&rsquo;isgen sees his father Biyarong-Barongan, whose head is now a window ornament, its golden hair like pouring rice when the breeze passes by.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For five days and nights Pala&rsquo;isgen rests on top of the coconut tree in front of Tigre of Nanlaliban&rsquo;s house. Tigre&rsquo;s daughter sees him and shouts for her father, exclaiming that revenge for Biyarong-Barongan has finally come. Tigre is amused, saying that what alarms her is nothing more than a meal for him to eat. The gong&rsquo;s sound reaches the seventh mountain, the eighth<sup> </sup>plateau. The warriors arrive in formation, lined up like a wall, their spears like cogon grass. They mock Pala&rsquo;isgen&rsquo;s manhood, and he reddens with anger, like the <i>biyangunan</i> (spirit of one who has been killed violently). He spins his golden shield until only the point of his spear is visible. When he leaps up, 50 are killed; when he lands, another 50 are killed. The girl cries out to her father to help the warriors defeat the man who kills 50 at every leap. His father laughs and mocks his daughter for being afraid of a mere piglet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Pala&rsquo;isgenan&rsquo;s brother Baybayanen has decided to go in quest of Pala&rsquo;isgen, who has been gone too long. Tubod kat Bulawan hands him tobacco and betel chew to give to Pala&rsquo;isgen when Baybayanen finds him. Baybayanen bids the slaves eat first before they pull his biday to the sea. The biday is as big and high as Mount Sundayapen, its peak almost reaching the stars. For a long time, Baybayanen waits to see his biday from his window. But the slaves cannot pull the biday and have all gone home. Baybayanen calls upon his pet <i>balalatok</i> (woodpecker) to pull the biday. Instantly the bird flies, lands on the boat&rsquo;s pole, and pulls it. It glides like a strand of hair and stops at the dock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Baybayanen flies on his biday, while his brothers, Piyamituunan and Magundali-dali, travel with him, separately but at the same speed. For five days and nights, they fly in the air. The santermo asks them where they are from, and they reply that that they are from the place where the sun sets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After a five-day journey, Baybayanen lands on the island of Daragat Pungtudanen (Maiden of the Isle). Baybayanen refuses the maiden&rsquo;s offer of tobacco and betel chew. The Daragat sends a typhoon to Baybayanen&rsquo;s biday, which heaves up and down on the waves, their crest almost reaching the stars. The slaves weep helplessly. Even Tagal Manansalan, the best helmsman among all, cannot control the biday. Suddenly they are back at the dock, where they had sailed from. The power of the Maiden of the Isle prevents it from budging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Piyamituunan loses his way and lands at the isle of Mali-wali. Magundali-dali journeys for a long time until he lands on top of the red coconut tree, which stands in front of Tigre&rsquo;s house. Here he finds his brother-in-law Pala&rsquo;isgen, whom he must fight in battle. The maiden sends her pet bee to investigate why the brothers Pala-isgen and Magundali-dali are fighting. The bee sprinkles them with the oil of Tilagdamay, and the two men, recognizing each other, burst into laughter. Magundali-dali gives Pala&rsquo;isgen the tobacco and betel chew that Tubod kat Bulawan has sent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Baybayanen has landed on the Island of Maliwaliw, where everything is reversed. He sees Piyamituunan, whom a whirlwind and a strong typhoon has swept toward this island. Baybayanen stops for drinks with his uncles before he resumes his journey. It lasts for years, until he arrives at the vast country of Tigre of Nanlaliban. He, too, sees his father&rsquo;s head, now Tigre&rsquo;s house ornament. Baybayanen opens fire on Tigre&rsquo;s house with a cannon, and half a wall flies up. Tigre&rsquo;s family and subjects call for him to return home before they are all exterminated, because Baybayanen and Pala-isgen&rsquo;s revenge has come. Women are pitiful, the narrator remarks, for they are nothing more than someone&rsquo;s meal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tigre takes up arms against Piyamituunan, Baybayanen, Biyarong-barongan, and Magundali-dali, none of whom can hit him. He mocks them for their incompetence. The battle lasts for years. Exhausted, the four brothers stop fighting and try to come up with a plan to defeat the Tigre. Pala-isgen commands his sword to fly up and drop down on Tigre&rsquo;s neck. Tigre finally dies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later, the brothers come upon Marupandayanen, carving a sheath for his kris. Marupandayanen challenges them to a fighting game. During the prolonged battle, all the crops, including the coconut trees, are felled. The Maiden of the Isle sends her bee to sprinkle them with her magic oil to stop them from fighting, because they are all brothers after all. At this revelation, the six men stop fighting and laugh merrily. Taking their father&rsquo;s head with them, they all fly home, except Baybayanen, who decides to go by sea. After journeying for years, they arrive at Baybayanen&rsquo;s dock, from where all the brothers walk home. Pala-isgen is welcomed home by his smiling wife, Tubod kat Bulawan. Their elder brother, Paraparampo, is also there to welcome them.&nbsp; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\"> </a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p><em>Philippine Epics and Ballads Archive</em>. 2015.

Serialized 17 Aug 1912&ndash;14 Nov 1912 in <b><i>El</i></b> <b><i>Renacimiento</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K. Santos</a>. Included in <b><i>Puso</i></b><i> <b>at Diwa</b></i>, volume 2, Manila: Limbagan at Litograpya ni Juan Fajardo, 1913. Included in <b><i>Ang</i></b><i> <b>Pangginggera</b> <b>at</b> <b>mga</b> <b>Piling</b> <b>Tula</b> <b>ni Lope</b> <b>K.</b> <b>Santos</b></i>.<i> </i>Editor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio Almario</a>, Manila: Balagtas Bicentennial Commission, 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is a 788-stanza narrative poem subtitled &ldquo;Alay sa Kababaihang Tagalog&rdquo; (Dedicated to Tagalog Women). The <i>panggingge </i>is a card game which Santos uses to symbolize not only human frailty expressed as vice, but also the predicament of women trapped in the mores of a conservative society and the strictures of patriarchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the narrative itself ostensibly recounts the travails of a certain woman who remains unnamed throughout, the poet&rsquo;s addressee is unmistakable in the apostrophe with which the poem begins: &ldquo;Oy, kung sino ka man&rdquo; (You, whoever you are). The woman in the poem is a housewife whose devotion to her husband changes soon after her firstborn dies. To cope with loneliness and boredom, she learns to gamble. She gets addicted to it, heedless of her husband&rsquo;s entreaties. Her husband is also addicted to vice&mdash;cockfighting. Marital woes come their way, involving infidelity on her part, jealousy, and separation. Her father and parents-in-law intervene, she is able to overcome her crisis, and she returns to her husband, bearing him another child. She finds work as a sewer, enjoys an improved relationship with her husband who has found gainful employment, and their life improves. But she and husband again get into gambling. The narrative closes on a tragic note. Her child dies as a consequence of her negligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last five stanzas have subheadings and serve as concluding didactic statements from the poet on human foibles and vice.

The woman in the poem is a housewife whose devotion to her husband changes soon after her firstborn dies. To cope with loneliness and boredom, she learns to gamble. She gets addicted to it, heedless of her husband&#x2019;s entreaties. Her husband is also addicted to vice&#x2014;cockfighting. Marital woes come their way, involving infidelity on her part, jealousy, and separation. Her father and parents-in-law intervene, she is able to overcome her crisis, and she returns to her husband, bearing him another child. She finds work as a sewer, enjoys an improved relationship with her husband who has found gainful employment, and their life improves. But she and husband again get into gambling. The narrative closes on a tragic note. Her child dies as a consequence of her negligence."

Revised edition in <b><i>Voices of Sulu: A Collection of Tausug Oral Traditions</i></b>. Editor, Gerard Rixhon. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Parang Sabil</i></b> is the epic of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> (&ldquo;people of the current&rdquo;) of the Sulu archipelago. It consists of songs that celebrate the heroism of legendary warriors and defenders of the Muslim faith. The songs are performed by both men and women, sometimes accompanied by the indigenous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/831\">bamboo xylophone</a> called <i>gabbang</i>. The musical accompaniment is described as &ldquo;fast, with moderate pitch which is sometimes high, sometimes low, and with percussive stress&rdquo; (Tuban 1988, 144).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The etymology of <i>parang sabil</i> reveals its religious nature. It is a combination of the Malay word <i>perang</i>, meaning &ldquo;war or sword,&rdquo; and the Arabic word <i>fil sabil-ullah</i>, meaning &ldquo;in the way of Allah.&rdquo; Thus, parang sabil means &ldquo;taking up the sword or going to war in submission to the will of Allah.&rdquo; The term refers to both the epic and the practice of taking up arms in obedience to Allah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic came into existence during the Spanish period, and it was largely inspired by the spirited Muslim defense of Sulu, the dar ul-Islam, abode of Islam, against the Spaniards and their Christianized mercenaries. The conquest of Jolo by the Spaniards in 1635 instigated a series of unrelenting attacks by local Muslims called <i>sabil</i> to prevent further Spanish inroads. The songs in the epic sprung largely from the Tausug sense of individual or collective notion of <i>martabat</i> or personal honor, pride, self-esteem, and of <i>sipug</i> or shame but also the capacity for virtue in a person. This appears to be borne by the themes of the more popular songs in the epic, such as &ldquo;Kissa kan Panglima Hassan&rdquo; (The Song of Panglima Hassan), about the hero who dies while resisting the imposition of taxes, and the &ldquo;Parang Sabil of Abdulla and Putli&rsquo; Isara in Spanish Times,&rdquo; which revolves around the attempt of the protagonists to avenge Putli Isara&rsquo;s honor, besmirched by a Spanish soldier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the more popular legendary heroes of the Tausug are Sali Bangsawan, Jekiri, an outlaw hero, and Panglima Munggona, who fought against the Spaniards and wielded such prowess that he was considered <i>kublan</i> or invincible. He is believed to have been poisoned by his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most celebrated, however, of the modern Tausug heroes is Panglima Hassan, hero of the historic Battle of Bud Bagsak recounted in &ldquo;Kissa kan Panglima Hassan.&rdquo; The song is based on events that happened between Oct 1903 and Mar 1904 in Jolo. The American colonial government imposed taxes and residence certificates on the Tausug, who regarded these as symbols of subjugation and domination. Panglima Hassan, a Tausug leader, led a resistance against the Americans, with more than a thousand kris-wielding Tausug warriors. He made his last stand in a crater of an extinct volcano, Bud Bagsak. He died with 26 bullet wounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The song begins during the Holy Month of fasting, and Andung, one of the Tausug leaders, is being tortured for resisting the imposition of the cedula. Antayung, another leader, calls on his Tausug kinsfolk to avenge Andung. A letter seeking support is sent to other Tausug leaders, one of them being Panglima Hassan of Luuk. The leaders consult Sultan Jamalul Kiram II, who says that they will all be imprisoned and they should surrender. Panglima rejects the advice, and the other leaders follow him. They send a letter to the American governor-general, virtually declaring war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American forces arrive and send emissary Hadji Butu to call on Panglima Hassan and his army to surrender. The call is brushed aside, and a battle ensues. The better equipped Americans defeat the Tausug. The pro-American sultan again asks Panglima Hassan to surrender, but the latter refuses. In the bitter engagement that follows, Panglima Hassan and his men are killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Throughout the song, the hero is characterized as unyielding in his opposition to any form of submission to American rule. He values the interest of the Tausug even above his personal loyalty to the sultan. His fighting prowess and ferocity are replicated in the actions of his Tausug warriors, who in history fought the American forces in Mindanao with such physical courage as it took all of American technological superiority to win the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Panglima Hassan is also in the &ldquo;Parang Sabil of Abdulla and Putli&rsquo; Isara in Spanish Times,&rdquo; although the true heroes in this song are the eponymous lovers and Panglima Hassan&rsquo;s wife, who is also Putli&rsquo; Isara&rsquo;s mother. The ballad opens with the main problem that the Tausug people face, the establishment of Spanish armed forces in Sulu. The next part introduces the protagonists Putli&rsquo; Isara, the lovely and angelic daughter of Panglima, and her betrothed, a brave young man named Abdulla. Before their wedding, Abdulla travels to Sandakan to buy an important pearl, which will be used in their wedding. While he is away, Putli&rsquo; Isara asks her father if she can bathe in the river nearby. Panglima, fearing for her safety, forbids it. Putli Isara goes anyway, reasoning that she will be accompanied by her younger brother. But, as Putli&rsquo; Isara is bathing in the river, Spanish soldiers appear. Their lieutenant, captivated by Putli&rsquo; Isara&rsquo;s beauty, embraces Putli&rsquo; Isara<i> </i>against her will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon arriving home from Sandakan, Abdulla learns of the Spaniard&rsquo;s assault on his betrothed. He decides to act in the manner prescribed by their religion. Abdulla and Putli&rsquo; Isara<i> </i>travel to the Spanish garrison to perform the parang sabil. The lovers are good fighters; they kill the lieutenant and 30 Spanish soldiers. But they, too, are killed. The <i>burak</i>, a flaming half-horse, half-human creature, which fetches Muslims who die for their religion, is seen muzzling the lovers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Panglima hears of the two lovers&rsquo; death, but he refuses to fetch Putli&rsquo; Asara&rsquo;s body. Matagpis, Putli&rsquo; Isara&rsquo;s mother, decides to continue the parang sabil. Putli&rsquo; Isara&rsquo;s younger brother wants to join her but is forbidden by Panglima. At the Spanish garrison, Matagpis, kris in hand, hacks away, killing seven soldiers. In the end, however, she dies, and the burak is seen muzzling Matagpis.

				"value": "<b><i>Parang Sabil</i></b> is the epic of the <a href=\"/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> (&#x201C;people of the current&#x201D;) of the Sulu archipelago. It consists of songs that celebrate the heroism of legendary warriors and defenders of the Muslim faith. The songs are performed by both men and women, sometimes accompanied by the indigenous <a href=\"/5/37/831\">bamboo xylophone</a> called <i>gabbang</i>. The musical accompaniment is described as &#x201C;fast, with moderate pitch which is sometimes high, sometimes low, and with percussive stress&#x201D; (Tuban 1988, 144)."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The etymology of <i>parang sabil</i> reveals its religious nature. It is a combination of the Malay word <i>perang</i>, meaning &#x201C;war or sword,&#x201D; and the Arabic word <i>fil sabil-ullah</i>, meaning &#x201C;in the way of Allah.&#x201D; Thus, parang sabil means &#x201C;taking up the sword or going to war in submission to the will of Allah.&#x201D; The term refers to both the epic and the practice of taking up arms in obedience to Allah."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The epic came into existence during the Spanish period, and it was largely inspired by the spirited Muslim defense of Sulu, the dar ul-Islam, abode of Islam, against the Spaniards and their Christianized mercenaries. The conquest of Jolo by the Spaniards in 1635 instigated a series of unrelenting attacks by local Muslims called <i>sabil</i> to prevent further Spanish inroads. The songs in the epic sprung largely from the Tausug sense of individual or collective notion of <i>martabat</i> or personal honor, pride, self-esteem, and of <i>sipug</i> or shame but also the capacity for virtue in a person. This appears to be borne by the themes of the more popular songs in the epic, such as &#x201C;Kissa kan Panglima Hassan&#x201D; (The Song of Panglima Hassan), about the hero who dies while resisting the imposition of taxes, and the &#x201C;Parang Sabil of Abdulla and Putli&#x2019; Isara in Spanish Times,&#x201D; which revolves around the attempt of the protagonists to avenge Putli Isara&#x2019;s honor, besmirched by a Spanish soldier."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Some of the more popular legendary heroes of the Tausug are Sali Bangsawan, Jekiri, an outlaw hero, and Panglima Munggona, who fought against the Spaniards and wielded such prowess that he was considered <i>kublan</i> or invincible. He is believed to have been poisoned by his wife."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The most celebrated, however, of the modern Tausug heroes is Panglima Hassan, hero of the historic Battle of Bud Bagsak recounted in &#x201C;Kissa kan Panglima Hassan.&#x201D; The song is based on events that happened between Oct 1903 and Mar 1904 in Jolo. The American colonial government imposed taxes and residence certificates on the Tausug, who regarded these as symbols of subjugation and domination. Panglima Hassan, a Tausug leader, led a resistance against the Americans, with more than a thousand kris-wielding Tausug warriors. He made his last stand in a crater of an extinct volcano, Bud Bagsak. He died with 26 bullet wounds."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The song begins during the Holy Month of fasting, and Andung, one of the Tausug leaders, is being tortured for resisting the imposition of the cedula. Antayung, another leader, calls on his Tausug kinsfolk to avenge Andung. A letter seeking support is sent to other Tausug leaders, one of them being Panglima Hassan of Luuk. The leaders consult Sultan Jamalul Kiram II, who says that they will all be imprisoned and they should surrender. Panglima rejects the advice, and the other leaders follow him. They send a letter to the American governor-general, virtually declaring war."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The American forces arrive and send emissary Hadji Butu to call on Panglima Hassan and his army to surrender. The call is brushed aside, and a battle ensues. The better equipped Americans defeat the Tausug. The pro-American sultan again asks Panglima Hassan to surrender, but the latter refuses. In the bitter engagement that follows, Panglima Hassan and his men are killed."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Throughout the song, the hero is characterized as unyielding in his opposition to any form of submission to American rule. He values the interest of the Tausug even above his personal loyalty to the sultan. His fighting prowess and ferocity are replicated in the actions of his Tausug warriors, who in history fought the American forces in Mindanao with such physical courage as it took all of American technological superiority to win the war."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Panglima Hassan is also in the &#x201C;Parang Sabil of Abdulla and Putli&#x2019; Isara in Spanish Times,&#x201D; although the true heroes in this song are the eponymous lovers and Panglima Hassan&#x2019;s wife, who is also Putli&#x2019; Isara&#x2019;s mother. The ballad opens with the main problem that the Tausug people face, the establishment of Spanish armed forces in Sulu. The next part introduces the protagonists Putli&#x2019; Isara, the lovely and angelic daughter of Panglima, and her betrothed, a brave young man named Abdulla. Before their wedding, Abdulla travels to Sandakan to buy an important pearl, which will be used in their wedding. While he is away, Putli&#x2019; Isara asks her father if she can bathe in the river nearby. Panglima, fearing for her safety, forbids it. Putli Isara goes anyway, reasoning that she will be accompanied by her younger brother. But, as Putli&#x2019; Isara is bathing in the river, Spanish soldiers appear. Their lieutenant, captivated by Putli&#x2019; Isara&#x2019;s beauty, embraces Putli&#x2019; Isara<i> </i>against her will."

Abdulla and Putli&#x2019; Isara<i> </i>travel to the Spanish garrison to perform the parang sabil. The lovers are good fighters; they kill the lieutenant and 30 Spanish soldiers. But they, too, are killed. The <i>burak</i>, a flaming half-horse, half-human creature, which fetches Muslims who die for their religion, is seen muzzling the lovers."

At the Spanish garrison, Matagpis, kris in hand, hacks away, killing seven soldiers. In the end, however, she dies, and the burak is seen muzzling Matagpis.

He begins by citing oral tradition as the roots of Tagalog poetry, and goes on to cite the changes brought about by Hispanic culture. The evolution of Tagalog poetry continues into the period of nationalist awakening and continued resistance toward the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century. This provides the setting for Abueg&rsquo;s discussion of Abadilla&rsquo;s pivotal revolt against traditional poetics. The historical milieu backgrounding the Abadilla phenomenon consisted of three periods successively dominated by three literary organizations: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5016\">Aklatang Bayan</a>, 1901-16; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5389\">Ilaw at Panitik</a>, 1916-35; and Kapisanang Panitikan, 1935-40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of Abadilla&rsquo;s contribution through his literary iconoclasm, Abueg writes that after Abadilla&rsquo;s revolt, there was no going back to the old voice and vision of Tagalog poetry, nor could <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> continue hiding in the &ldquo;cave of convention.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

The evolution of Tagalog poetry continues into the period of nationalist awakening and continued resistance toward the end of the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century. This provides the setting for Abueg&#x2019;s discussion of Abadilla&#x2019;s pivotal revolt against traditional poetics. The historical milieu backgrounding the Abadilla phenomenon consisted of three periods successively dominated by three literary organizations: <a href=\"/9/9/5016\">Aklatang Bayan</a>, 1901-16; <a href=\"/9/9/5389\">Ilaw at Panitik</a>, 1916-35; and Kapisanang Panitikan, 1935-40."

The first poem, &ldquo;Kung ang Pagsinta Ko&rdquo; (If My Love Were), is a sonnet addressed to a &ldquo;Luzvimin&rdquo;&mdash;a portmanteau for Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao&mdash;to whom the persona emphatically declares that one must express one&rsquo;s love by deed and not by mere word. This theme of love for country will sustain the entire collection, as Borlongan uses his poetry to expose stark social realities.

In &ldquo;Kasulatan sa Pagsasanla&rdquo; (Deed of Mortgage), the form of a legal document is used to satirize the servitude of the Filipinos to the Americans. In &ldquo;Sa Likod ng Karimlan&rdquo; (Behind the Darkness), the persona urges the reader to breathe in the stench of blood of their forefathers killed in the protracted war in the countryside.

The longest poem in the collection, &ldquo;Pagsalubong sa Nanlilisik na Silahis ng Araw&rdquo; (Meeting the Fierce Sun&rsquo;s Ray), has news headlines serving as section breaks in a poem depicting a newsman-poet&rsquo;s daily life.

In his <b>aral</b> (moral lessons), for instance, he makes clear theological distinctions between imperfect contrition (&#x201C;atricion&#x201D;) and perfect contrition (&#x201C;contricion&#x201D;); evidently, in the 19th century, Filipino writers took pains to show a sophistication and cosmopolitanism to disprove Spanish derision of the <i>indio</i> (Christianized native). In the conservative and defensive temper of the clergy of his age, de la Merced exhorts the reader to remain loyal to Spain, citing the Filipinos&#x2019; indebtedness to the Spanish crown that took pains to support the evangelization of the Philippines and bring to it the light of the Gospel."

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5117\">Manuel Bernabe</a>. Manila: Imprenta de Carmelo Bauermann.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This anthology of 63 Spanish poems showcases the poet&rsquo;s mastery of style and versatility in meter and theme. Included are elegiac, patriotic, religious, philosophic, epic, lyric, and folkloric poems. Three of the poems won prizes in three different literary contests in 1913.

In &ldquo;Pambusog sa Mata&rdquo; (Eye Candy), a man describes the daily routine of a wealthy neighbor, who goes to the office in a shiny car, and wonders how she manages to curb her hunger to maintain her youthful figure when just a stone&rsquo;s throw away from her place are children starving. In &ldquo;Isang Matrona ang Nagsimba&rdquo; (A Matron Goes to Church), a well-heeled and bejeweled churchgoer appears to be holy and courteous until the bellman sneezes and snot lands on her ear.

In &ldquo;Damhin Mo, Mutya Ko&rdquo; (Feel It, My Muse), a farm boy serenades a country lass, promising her the good life, expressed in images of hard work and bountiful harvests. The versified &ldquo;Sinulat para Kantahin&rdquo; (Written to Be Sung) is about the deep pain of a man who gave his all to a woman who loved another. &ldquo;Blas ng Lagaslas&rdquo; (Blas of the Splashing Water) is about an ideal husband who becomes a uxoricide when gambling and the death of a firstborn get the better of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Kabalahibo at Kontrapelo&rdquo; contains mainly Antonio&rsquo;s nostalgic observations on his own life and those of his town mates in Nueva Ecija. &ldquo;Ang Silong&rdquo; (The Lower Floor) and &ldquo;Ang Babae sa Ilang&rdquo; (Dead Woman in the Bushes) are character sketches&mdash;the first of a poor bachelor who becomes a rich woman&rsquo;s kept man, the second of a murdered young woman. Some of the most vivid poems in this section are &ldquo;Kahuli-hulihang Kalabaw&rdquo; (The Last Carabao), about a carabao who dies of heartbreak from being displaced by machines, and &ldquo;Gaong&rdquo; (Pond), about a lovely pond that was the site of the speaker&rsquo;s memorable childhood experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aging, memory, and forgetfulnes are the central themes in &ldquo;Mata-matang Lilim.&rdquo; &ldquo;Limang Awit&rdquo; (Five Songs) expresses faith amid human fragility and unrelenting suffering. In &ldquo;Tirador&rdquo; (Sling/Assassin), the speaker remembers a former classmate, Ador, who has become a professional assassin, a far cry from the good-natured, sling-totting boy of the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Pingkian&rdquo; is a historical verse narrative poem told from the point of view of its youthful protagonist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5393\">Emilio Jacinto</a>. The poem has 1,396 lines written in dodecasyllabic quatrains with alternating rhymes. Jacinto&rsquo;s tale follows closely the story of the Philippine Revolution, from the founding of the Katipunan to its continuation under the leadership of Emilio Aguinaldo. The most interesting parts are Antonio&rsquo;s reimagined rendition of Jacinto&rsquo;s life, a law student at the University of Santo Tomas who at age 18 joined the Katipunan, its youngest member.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Pingkian </i></b>shows Antonio&rsquo;s undiminished skill as a versifier and commentator on the past and on contemporary Philippine life. His early, modernist experimentations are here tempered, his incisive and memorable poetic insights on aging, suffering, love, and hope producing a burnished quality that bespeaks wise maturity. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5090\">Romulo Baquiran Jr</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5090\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

In this system, the last sounded consonants of the last syllable of a line are reversed in the last word of the next line; thus, <i>man</i> will rhyme with <i>name</i>.

She sleeps with a man whom she has met in the woods but, come morning, she leaves him stone cold.

Using the popular form of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a>, de Jesus narrates what has become of the once self-sufficient, peaceful, and free Pulong Ginto (Isle of Gold) with the coming of foreign rulers. Misfortune befalls the kingdom of Haring Pilipo when Reyna Malaya is reported missing. Three of their daughters, Princesses Luningning, Bituin, and Mandiwang, set out to search for their mother with the help of their loved ones&mdash;namely, Bayani, Dakila, and Magiting. Lost in the forest, each one shows extraordinary courage and determination in finding Reyna Malaya to bring her back to the ailing Hari. Meanwhile, the kingdom endures untold suffering. Reyna Malaya, kept in a dark castle in the interior of the forest, is abused by the cardinal of the kingdom of King Iberia and Queen Cristina. However, Bayani finds her, and she is eventually freed by a revolution led by him and the two other princes. Once more the family is reunited, and freedom and happiness reign in the kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon, however, another group of foreign rulers, led by Haring Samuel and his sons Prinsipe Dolar and Duke Demokratiko, visits Pulong Ginto. The kingdom of Haring Pilipo, with characteristic hospitality, welcomes and befriends them. Eventually, Haring Samuel, through deceit and manipulation, becomes the actual ruler. Meanwhile, the natives are divided as to how to perceive him and the power he represents. De Jesus ends his narrative with an admonition to the youth to wake up from complacency and realize the truth that the country&rsquo;s freedom is being consumed, termite-like, by foreigners, and it must be fought for and regained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Written by de Jesus at the height of his popularity as the &ldquo;King of the Balagtasan,&rdquo; this work assumes particular significance as the poet&rsquo;s contribution to the nationalist and democratic intellectual tradition. Widely known as the purveyor of romantic love, de Jesus is regarded as the &ldquo;Makata ng Puso&rdquo; (Poet of Love). With this poem among other major works, he is being rediscovered. In this work, which is very much in the tradition of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco &quot;Balagtas&quot; Baltazar</a>, de Jesus wields his talent and popularity to pierce through the pro-Americanism dominant at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1995, on the birth centenary of de Jesus, a new edition of the poem was published: <b><i>Sa Dakong Silangan at mga Tulang Pasalaysay ni Jose Corazon de Jesus</i></b> (In the East and Other Narrative Poems of Jose Corazon de Jesus), edited by Virgilio S. Almario. Apart from the title poem, the other works in the book are &ldquo;Ang Sawa&rdquo; (The Python) and &ldquo;Ang Kartero&rdquo; (The Carter), from <b><i>Mga Dahong</i> <i>Ginto</i></b>, ca 1916 and 1920; &ldquo;Gloria,&rdquo; serialized in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, 4 Jan&ndash;25 Apr 1925, and included in <b><i>Mga Tulang Ginto</i></b>, 1958; &ldquo;Ang Ilaw sa Kapitbahay&rdquo; (The Neighbor&rsquo;s Light), serialized in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\"><b><i>Liwayway</i></b></a>,<b> </b>4 May&ndash;9 Aug 1929; &ldquo;Ang mga Itinapon&rdquo; (The Discarded), 1930; and &ldquo;Maruming Basahan&rdquo; (Dirty Rag), serialized in <b><i>Sampagita</i></b>, 3 Jun&ndash;26 Aug 1931.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Almario&rsquo;s introduction situates Jesus&rsquo;s poems squarely against the sociopolitical context of the powerful movement that Almario labeled <b>balagtasismo</b> in his study <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1577\"><strong>Balagtasismo versus Modernismo</strong></a></i></b>, 1984. Balagtasismo was a movement of a group of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> poets writing in the first half of the 20th century who emulated the works of Francisco Baltazar. Almario argues that at the start of the 20th century, writers in Tagalog used their writing to liberate themselves from the iniquitous Spanish colonial past, to celebrate their own culture and tradition, and to further cultivate and animate their own writing against the systematic imposition of English and a new way of life that would spell the death of traditional values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The narratives of de Jesus freely partook of diverse influences from literary traditon, including the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><b>duplo</b></a>, the <b>awit</b>, and <b>korido</b>. The poems published in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> and <b><i>Sampagita</i></b>, on the other hand, can be read side by side with the popular novels in the magazines. De Jesus&rsquo;s narratives deployed the staples and conventions of the popular novel&mdash;unrequited love, mistaken identity, dolorous scenes, arch villains, pathetic heroes, and suffering heroines. &ldquo;Ang Kartero&rdquo; is a case in point. It revolves around Benito, a poor orphan in a far-flung barrio who is smitten by a beautiful woman to whom he pledges his eternal love. His job as a mailman helps him discover the woman&rsquo;s treachery as she succumbs to the importunings of a wealthy suitor. Driven by powerful emotions of fury and betrayal, Benito kills the woman and her lover in front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>. The poem ends with the sight of the young man now totally deranged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The view that de Jesus was a man immersed in the historical specificities of the first four decades of the 20th century is evident in the poems. Even in stories with love as a theme, the movements in the narrative demonstrate an ongoing dialogue between personal lives and public history. The book<i> </i>is a worthy addition to the growing body of criticism not only in poetry but also in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/74/1563\">literary criticism</a>. While Almario&rsquo;s introduction provides a necessary context, the anthology itself gives the reader an opportunity to gain a better appreciation of the multifaceted artistry of Jose Corazon de Jesus. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5743\">Rosario Torres-Yu</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

It is sung in the Subanon language in communal affairs like the <i>buklog</i>,<i> </i>a feast honoring the gods, or a wake. The tale was recorded and transcribed by Virgilio Resma, a schoolteacher in one of the public schools of Ozamis City, in 1981. He was aided by some Subanon informants and by Epifania M. Alunan. Resma&rsquo;s principal source for this guman was Perena, a native of Sindangan, Zamboanga del Norte. She was 62 years old when the recording took place in Barrio Pawas. She had learned the epic from her grandmother, Bay Aya. Perena chanted the epic in the evenings for a week, starting at about nine or ten and ending at about three the following morning. She chanted at night to concentrate. To start, she drinks either coconut wine called tuba<i> </i>or a bottle of beer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This 6,477-line guman is characterized by the repetition of scenes and episodes. These scenes and episodes involve the nearly endless rounds of fighting, the gearing up for a journey, the ritualistic drinking of <i>gasi </i>wine, and the long bouts of sleep. Magic is also integral to the epic. Examples in the epic include flying kerchiefs, talking birds, and physical transformations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Datu Salaria, the chief of Tubig Liyasan (Waters of Liyasan) is troubled, for his wife Salaong is childless. The couple decide to go bathe in the springs of Liyasan, reputed to be magical. Salaong dips herself seven times into the waters and begins to feel heavy, although she is not pregnant. When she returns home, she applies oil to her hair and combs it. A child falls from her hair. He is named Sandayo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a week, he learns to walk; in a month, he asks for his parents&rsquo; permission to go on a journey. His father gives him a <i>kalis </i>or sword, and his mother dresses him up in a glittering robe. Before Sandayo departs, he receives a warning from a <i>limmon</i> or wild pigeon, but he ignores it. Sandayo rides his <i>monsala </i>or<i> </i>kerchief and commands the lightning to take him to the center of the sun. While enjoying his <i>mamaq </i>or<i> </i>betel chew, in the sun, he dreams of two ladies: Bae Bolak Sonday and Benobong. They offer him their mamaq, but he accepts only Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s offer. Awakening, he sets out to look for the waters of Gwalo Leyo and, after two weeks, finds them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sandayo easily enchants the two datus of Gwalo Leyo, Daugbolawan and Lemolok, who decide to adopt him. After a week, Lomelok hears sounds from the buklog of Lumanay. Sandayo and the two datus decide to attend the feast; but on their way, Sandayo receives a warning from the limmon. Again, he ignores it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the feast, Sandayo meets Bolak Sonday and Benobong, the two ladies he dreamt of. Because most of the datus are enchanted by Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s beauty, a rivalry among them arises. Bolak Sonday, however, shows affection for Damodianay. Sandayo is jealous. He challenges Damodianay to a duel, which lasts for two years. Among the consequences of this battle is the drying of the sea, causing giant eels to seek refuge ashore and sea nymphs to weep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the third year, the god Asog intervenes. Together with his wife Bae Asog, he descends to the earth to end the feud. The gods reveal that the two feuding datus are really twins. Both of them had fallen from the hair of Salaong, but Damondianay was blown away by the wind. Thus, he grew up in the isle of Balakatan. The brothers are reconciled, and they journey to Balakatan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Sandayo invites Damodianay to visit their parents in Liyasan, Damodianay refuses because he considers himself the guardian of the hills of Balakatan. To remedy the situation, Sandayo charms Damodianay to sleep. While Damodianay is sleeping, Sandayo cuts sections of the hills of Balakatan from the earth and, with a leap, brings them to Liyasan. Thus, the brothers are reunited with their parents. To celebrate, Datu Salaria beheads seven <i>tinayobos</i>,<i> </i>or<i> </i>female servants, and seven <i>sampilakan</i>, or<i> </i>male servants. After the celebration, Datu Salaria asks Sandayo to accompany his cousins, Daugbolawan and Lomelok, from Tobig Sumina to Manelangan to propose to Bolak Sonday and Benobong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the way to Manelangan on board the <i>gadyong </i>or ship, they encounter Bae Pigdindingan. They refuse her offer of mamaq. Insulted, she curses the datus. A wind sweeps over the ship; it becomes an octopus and captures the ship. But Sandayo flings the octopus at Pigdindingan. It clings to her body, killing her at daytime and reviving her at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Manelangan, many datus seek Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s hand in marriage, but none of them, not even the powerful Datu Lumalab, satisfies the parents of Bolak Sonday. Datu Pombanwa, the father, asks for a <i>sinduko </i>or scythe and an axe. Bae Salagga, the mother asks, among other things, for jars as numerous as the grains of one ganta of millet, a golden bridge connecting the suitor&rsquo;s house to Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s room, and a golden trough connecting the sun with her own room. In addition, Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s nurse asks for a golden comb and a golden loom, among other things. With magic, Sandayo produces the dowry in his cousins&rsquo; behalf. He also butchers a great pig for the banquet in his cousins&rsquo; behalf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s parents accept the cousins, Datu Lumalab and the other datus engage them in battle. During the battle, Sandayo leaves his spear, which fights on its own, and flies to drink from the sweat of the sun. After several months, Sandayo and his cousins defeat Datu Lumalab and the other datus. Using the golden bridge, Sandayo and his cousins return to Sumina, bringing with them the two women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Sandayo returns to Liyasan, he falls ill. He sends his monsala to fetch Bolak Sonday and Benobong, but it is too late. Sandayo dies. Bolak Sonday initiates a search for Sandayo&rsquo;s spirit. She searches the lower world, while Benobong searches the upper world. After roaming for three weeks, the two women meet, each of them frustrated. Benobong then searches for Sandayo&rsquo;s spirit in the sky, while Bolak Sonday looks around in the world. After two months, the women meet again, still not having found Sandayo&rsquo;s spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the women are resting under the <i>bolongis</i>,<i> </i>which is a legendary tree, a <i>sumusom</i> (a small black bird with red eyes) and a <i>dalandaw</i> (a yellow bird with black streak) perch on the tree and start discussing the woman&rsquo;s state. The birds reveal to them where Sandayo&rsquo;s spirit is and how the woman may get there. They also leave them some of their feathers, which are transformed into brilliant rings. These light the ladies&rsquo; way to Tubig Piksiipan, where Sandayo&rsquo;s spirit is a captive of amazons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Riding their monsala, the women command the lightning to bring them to Tubig Piksiipan. Bolak Sonday steals Sandayo&rsquo;s spirit and changes it into a ring. A battle between the amazons and Bolak Sonday occurs, lasting for two months. Soon, Bolak Sonday and Benobong defeat the amazons. They ride the monsala and command the lightning to transport them to Sandayo&rsquo;s chamber. There, Bolak Sonday rouses Sandayo, who seems to be asleep. He requests a drink from the sun&rsquo;s sweat. Bolak Sonday swiftly flies to the sun to obtain a drink in a cup of gold. The drink revives Sandayo. The two women return home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While cutting a golden betel nut, Bolak Sonday wounds herself. Although the wound is small, it bleeds so much that she dies. Sandayo, summoned by her monsala, initiates the search for Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s spirit. Together with Lomelok, Mendepasa, and Datu Daugbolawan, Sandayo searches both the upper and the lower worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once, while he and the datus are resting under a bolongis tree, two birds, a <i>gowak</i> crow and a sumusom, inform them that Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s spirit is in Katonawan. They give the datus some feathers, which they make into a brilliant ring to illuminate their path. They arrive in Katonawan and find the spirit of Bolak Sonday a captive of the datu. Sandayo fights the datu and frees Bolak Sonday&rsquo;s spirit. Bolak Sonday is revived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sandayo returns to Liyasan where his father holds a blood rite to celebrate his return. After that, Sandayo goes to Tubig Sumina to visit his other cousins. There, his two cousins&mdash;Datu Tulog and Pammintoan&mdash;request him to help them secure the dowry they need for Datu Tulog to marry Lengotubig. Lengotubig&rsquo;s parents ask for the same dowry that Datu Pombanwa and Bae Salagga did for Bolak Sonday and Benobong. Using his magic, Sandayo helps them, and Datu Tulog marries Lengotubig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Sandayo returns to Liyasan, he dreams that his uncle is preparing a buklog<i> </i>in which his presence is essential. When he awakes, he asks his parents to go with him. He also invites Lomelok, Bolak Sonday, Daugbolawan, Benobong, Mendepesa, Panday Tape, Bae Salangka, and all their children. They ride their monsala to Manelangan, the place of Sandayo&rsquo;s uncle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As they hold the buklog, the <i>buklogan </i>or platform slowly rises to heaven. Sandayo promises his servants that he will return to take them to heaven. When the platform has reached the clouds, it descends to the earth. But Sandayo and his relatives have already gone to heaven. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Servando Halili Jr.</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Resma, Virgilio. 1982. &ldquo;Keg Sumba neg Sandayo.&rdquo; <em>Kinaadman </em>4:259-426.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

Do&ntilde;a Sancha marries Gonzalo de Lara, popularly called Busto de Lara. After giving birth to seven boys all at one time, she dies. Identical in beauty and goodness, the &ldquo;siete infantes&rdquo; grow up to be strong, brave and active boys, renowned and feared by the Moors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile Rubio Velasquez marries Do&ntilde;a Lambra. At the wedding, the youngest of the princes quarrels with Lambra, who then asks her husband to avenge her. Don Rubio plots against his brother-in-law and his seven nephews. He advises the king to send Busto de Lara to the Turkish emperor with a letter asking for a truce, but Don Rubio substitutes it with a letter asking the Turkish emperor to kill the bearer. Don Rubio also assures the emperor that he will see to it that the seven princes get killed in battle. Impressed by Busto de Lara&rsquo;s handsome and robust figure, the Turkish emperor does not kill him but consents to his daughter&rsquo;s request to make Busto de Lara a slave in her garden. Busto and Princess Hisme&ntilde;a fall in love and the princess becomes pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, war breaks out between Spain and Turkey and as planned, Rubio Velasquez puts the seven princes at the head of the Spanish army. They are, however, made to fall into a big pit where their heads are chopped off, put into a chest, and sent to King Almanzor in Turkey. At the dinner to celebrate the victory, King Almanzor invites Busto de Lara to sit with them at the table. Recognizing his sons&rsquo; heads on the platter, Busto de Lara faints. Upon reviving, he kisses each head and laments over it. The emperor takes pity on him and releases him. After burying his sons&rsquo; heads, Busto de Lara leaves the Turkish court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After Busto de Lara&rsquo;s departure, Princess Hisme&ntilde;a gives birth to their son, Morada Gonzalo, who shows remarkable strength. At age 13, he hits the king of Arabia&rsquo;s head with a chessboard and kills him because the latter has called him a bastard. He demands from his mother that she tell him who his father is. The princess tells him and advises him to go to Spain to escape the revenge of the subjects of the king of Arabia and to look for his father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Morada Gonzalo begins to avenge the death of his seven half-brothers. First, he beheads the four Turkish generals responsible for their death. Then, he beheads Rubio, his captain, and Lambra. With the seven heads, Morada Gonzalo searches for his father, whom he finds sick, still weeping over the loss of his seven sons. Posing as a merchant from Turkey, Morada offers his wares&mdash;joy and sorrow&mdash;to his father. When the father replies that he would like to buy joy, Morada presents the seven heads on a platter. Busto de Lara is at first shocked at the ghastly spectacle but when Morada explains to him whose heads they are, he becomes happy and gets well. Morada asks that his father redeem his and his mother&rsquo;s honor by marrying her. Busto de Lara agrees to do so if the princess will embrace Christianity, and Morada promises to persuade his mother to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Accompanied by his father, Morada Gonzalo explains to the king the reason for his slaying Rubio Velasquez and his companions. The king is satisfied to hear that Morada wishes to be converted. Morada then returns to Turkey to fetch his mother. Morada and his mother, disguised as a knight, manage to escape from Turkey and are reunited with Busto de Lara. The king orders a big feast. Morada and his mother are baptized and given Christian names. The wedding of Busto de Lara and Princess Hisme&ntilde;a is, however, interrupted when Turkish troops attack the kingdom. Everybody goes out to fight, including Princess Hisme&ntilde;a, who dons armor and aids her husband, who is being hard-pressed by the Moors. Morada tries to appease King Almanzor&rsquo;s anger and appeals to the king to be converted to Christianity, but the old man refuses. Busto de Lara and Hisme&ntilde;a join in their pleas, but the king is adamant. Finally, Morada Gonzalo invokes the aid of God and the Blessed Virgin, and miraculously Almanzor yields to captivity and conversion. He is baptized, with King Filipo of Spain as sponsor. His wounds miraculously heal, to the amazement of the Turks, who then also ask to be baptized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">King Filipo invites everyone to his palace, where he formally asks for the hand of Princess Hisme&ntilde;a in marriage to Busto de Lara. The interrupted wedding is completed, making Morada a legitimate child. Prince Morada inherits the Turkish throne, Busto de Lara is crowned king of Spain, and King Almanzor enters a Franciscan monastery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The derivation from Spanish legend contains the extraordinary motif of the treacherous killing of seven young princes and the presentation of their heads on a platter to their father. Balancing this motif is the revenge motif, in which the young avenger beheads the guilty seven people. The romance also features a boy-hero, whose character is too fanciful even for a romance. Fresh from baptism, he displays incredible knowledge of Christian doctrine when he instructs his grandfather Almanzor in the Christian faith. These features must have appealed to the readers, for the <b><i>Siete</i></b><i> <b>Infantes</b> </i>enjoyed great popularity during the early decades of the 20th century, told and retold in various Philippine languages in regions with a <b>korido </b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a>) tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1950, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1291\">movie version</a> of <b><i>Siete Infantes de Lara </i></b>was directed and produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5284\">Damiana Eugenio</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5284\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

Translators, Nicole Revel, Talib Lim Sangogot, Gerard Rixhon, and Alain Martenot. Paris: Geuthner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This <b>kata-kata</b>, or sung narrative, is the epic of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a>, aka Sama-Bajau, people of the Sulu archipelago. It was chanted by Manubul Sama singer Binsu Lakbaw in 1997 at South Ubian, Tawi-Tawi. Silungan Baltapa is the epic hero&rsquo;s name, which means &ldquo;a place for meditation.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic opens with the hero, his body shining as bright as stars, calling on his servant to prepare for a sea voyage to search for the Island of Mercy and Love, at the place of the Setting Sun. His mother, Ugbusan Sahaya (Source of Light), objects, for she has kept him under his seven-layered gauze canopy all his life to protect him from the natural elements. Silungan declares that only maidens are kept under a gauze canopy all their lives. He and his servant board Jalampa the boat, taking his <i>agung</i> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>), named Kili-Kili Intan (String of Diamonds), to charm maidens with. The servant rows until they are exhausted, so Silungan summons a typhoon to speed them on their way. After three months they are welcomed into the island home of Mussa Dalmata (Only Pearl). Silungan tells Dalmata stories until they both fall asleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Elsewhere, two <b>nuli</b> birds (message carriers) tell Misil Balan (Mighty Steel) that Silungan is stealing his fianc&eacute;e Dalmata from him. The angry datu is in Dalmata&rsquo;s residence in an instant. Silungan&rsquo;s servant and Misil Balan fight for a month until the servant weakens and dies. Silungan Baltapa, too, is no match for Misil Batan. Two nuli birds seek the help of Silungan Baltapa&rsquo;s sister, Muslim Magkapala (Muslim Lady). In an instant, she stands before Misil Balan, who belittles her because she is a woman. Magkapala waves her <i>sulban</i> (magic scarf), which kills Misil Balan. She then restores Silungan Baltapa&rsquo;s life with the sulban. At Silungan&rsquo;s request, she does the same to Misil Balan. The datu declares his obedience to Magkapala from then on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the bride-price, Dalmata&rsquo;s mother demands the Junub Istinja (Tree of Purity), with the blinding glow, standing in the garden of Paradise. Magkapala obtains it for her brother, and so Dalmata and Silungan are wed, amid the recitation of their genealogies and the Forgiveness ritual. After a month, the newlyweds sail to the Island of Love to visit Ugbusan Sahaya, now Dalmata&rsquo;s mother-in-law. When marauders are about to attack the newlyweds&rsquo; ships, Magkapala hovers above the marauders and kicks them overboard. The journey, which would ordinarily last a month, is cut to half a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One morning while Dalmata is lying with her head on her husband&rsquo;s lap and the servant is running a fine-toothed comb through her hair, two birds from the Hereafter fly in carrying a santol fruit. Dalmata craves the fruit, so Silungan scours the Hereafter for it. He encounters two <i>galura</i> (half-human-half-animal creatures), whose giant wings cover half the sky. Silungan defeats the two galura birds in battle and returns home to Dalmata with the fruit. While resting, Dalmata has a premonition of her death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalmata gives birth to a boy, who is immediately able to walk and is given the name, Datu Muhmin (Believing Datu). But Dalmata dies soon afterward. The Qur&rsquo;an is read, a food offering prepared, and her body bathed and embalmed. She is placed in a &ldquo;coffin-boat of mirrors with three woven ties of gold&rdquo; and buried by Baltapa&rsquo;s window so he can sing to her. At the funeral, Silungan gives away a ganta of gold to each man and imam who comes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The inconsolable Silungan follows his departed wife to Heaven, with the hope of bringing her back to life. He tests his <i>palkatan</i> (supernatural inner power) by making the clouds move and the ocean dry. He also recites the <i>gumbila</i> to strengthen his power. Silungan Baltapa&rsquo;s journey to Heaven begins at the Kandala<i> </i>junction, where lies the boundary between Heaven and Hell. He enters Heaven and encounters newborn children desiring to save their parents from sin. He leaves Heaven and sees people who have committed abortion drowning in blood; people who have committed &ldquo;forbidden acts&rdquo; drowning in coconut milk; and flirtatious wives being tortured with an iron bar. Silungan arrives at the last level of Kandala,<i> </i>where the Grand Mufti Aulia guards the gates of Heaven. He gives Silungan an heirloom ring, yellow and bluish green, and instructs him to choose only the middle path toward Heaven.

He and his servant board Jalampa the boat, taking his <i>agung</i> (<a href=\"/5/37/810\">gong</a>), named Kili-Kili Intan (String of Diamonds), to charm maidens with.

She sings a nativized version of the nursery rhyme, &ldquo;<i>Seesaw, up and down</i> / <i>Tell me the way to London town</i>.&rdquo; This image collapses history, culture, and the postcultural dilemmas of language loss, reorientations, and accommodation in the particular world of a woman who remembers and foresees the inevitability of her separation from her child.

To save Lem Lunay, Tud Bulul must trade his sister Kenaban for a shield owned by Datu Busaw, chief of Henluy Mountain. Tud Bulul and Kenaban traverse eight mountains until they reach Henluy. Suddenly a storm breaks out, and the skies are filled with flying <i>busaw</i> (evil spirits). Datu Busaw gives Tud Bulul weapons and clothes in exchange for Kenaban. They hear a warrior&rsquo;s cry, mocking Tud Bulul for sacrificing Kenaban. Busaw beheads the warrior, and the other busaw feast on the body. Busaw leaves with Kenaban, and Tud Bulul leaves for home. Busaw&rsquo;s sympathetic sister, Lembenan, plans Kenaban&rsquo;s escape, but Kenaban is resolute about staying. She pounds rice for Busaw&rsquo;s guests. At midnight, a huge snake named Datu Lamay, who has been sent by Tud Bulul, gives Kenaban the venomous black part of his liver. She is to mix it with the rice to wreak havoc among the busaw&rsquo;s party guests. He also gives her his right horn and instructs her to use it to tame the busaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The next morning, Busaw falls ill from Kenaban&rsquo;s concoction. He promises Kenaban her freedom and offers her several gifts if she cures him. Kenaban takes a small bowl, an aromatic root, and the snake&rsquo;s horn. She prays over these, then smokes Busaw&rsquo;s body and heals him completely. This causes a character transformation in Busaw, hereafter named Tegingkan Densu Libun, who becomes Tud Bulul&rsquo;s staunch ally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For two days he battles with the enemy, Datu Loko Tegedung, a powerful newborn, with the placenta and his umbilical cord still attached. When Kenaban and Lembenan arrive on a horse, Tegedung snatches them. Tud Bulul, astride a horse, and Tegingkan, on a beetle-sized one, must now travel through plains, mountains, forests, and islands to rescue their sisters. Along the way, a series of giant snakes and a dragon join them one after another: Datu Lamay, then Datu Lugod, the dragon Sewaga, and several snakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tud Bulul must slash through the iron mountain of Anggan. But Tud Bulul&rsquo;s <i>kampilan</i> (cutlass) is only a palm long. Datu Lugod takes the knife&rsquo;s hilt between his teeth, while Datu Lamay, the blade. They pull it in opposite directions until it stretches up to the sun. Tegingkan attempts to cut the mountain first. Three times he strikes, but his sword only curves down to the middle. It is Tud Bulul who succeeds in splitting the mountain, giving it three strikes. As they continue traveling, they encounter a man walking in his sleep. When the sleeping man does not reply to Tud Bulul&rsquo;s queries, Tud Bulul strikes him in the nose. The man is Datu Lambon Tungo Mogow, one of Kemokul&rsquo;s children and therefore Tud Bulul&rsquo;s brother, who was once offered as a sacrifice. Lambon asks for Tud Bulul&rsquo;s <i>kimu</i> (personal treasures), but Tud Bulul will grant Lambon&rsquo;s wish only if he accompanies them in their quest. Lambon does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">They pass through other worlds and several mountains. When they finally arrive in Mebusung, the party divides into groups and they hide in different places. Lambon captures the quake that Tegedung has brought to Lem Lunay. Tud Bulul challenges Tegedung to a fight. From Tegingkan&rsquo;s shield emanates a force that destroys the town. But the town instantly springs back to life, and Tegedung belittles Tegingkan. Tud Bulul displays his power next and summons quakes from his habiliments and companions. The tremor and conflagration last for seven days, reaching distant lands and demolishing everything. Lambon helps Tegingkan fight the enemy, but they cannot subdue Tegedung. Tud Bulul creates a bamboo trap as big as a mountain, and Tegedung is captured. But Tud Bulul and Tegedung suddenly vanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lambon travels the many levels of the Realm of the Dead in search of Tud Bulul. He meets several characters whom he threatens into helping him. He learns that Tud Bulul is about to forge a pact of friendship with Datu Kayung, chief of the region of the the murdered ones. Under threat, Datu Kayung reveals that the pact has been made, and Tud Bulul has gone home. Lambon demands from Kayung the amulet of Lem Fuyan Koyu Anggan, the warrior killed by Busaw in Henluy, so that Lambon would become part of the pact between Kayung and Tud Bulul. Kayung gives in. Lambon leaps from the place and lands in Lem Lunay, burning everything in his path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prodded by his father Kemokul, Tud Bulul calls to Lambon, who expresses his bitterness at Tud Bulul&rsquo;s abandonment and for leaving him out of the pact with Kayung. Hence, he decides to destroy Lem Lunay and Tud Bulul. Kemokul intervenes and, at his request, Tud Bulul agrees to give what Lambon wants&mdash;the twin of Tud Bulul&rsquo;s <i>gading</i>. Lambon goes up the house, and Kemokul has Tud Bulul share a betel chew with Tegingkan&rsquo;s sister Lembenan. He does the same with Tegingkan and Tud Bulul&rsquo;s sister Kenaban. He bids farewell, leaving instructions for everyone, and, with his chosen companions, departs for Kotun Gewolun, where he will spend the rest of his life. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Efmer Agustin</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Lapiz, Eduardo M. 2006. &ldquo;Sotu Tutul Tud Bulul (Isang Kwento ni Tud Bulul): Pagsasa-Filipino ng Isang &lsquo;Hlolok&rsquo; ng mga T&rsquo;boli na Inawit ni Ma&rsquo;Dison.&rdquo; MA thesis, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

As they continue traveling, they encounter a man walking in his sleep. When the sleeping man does not reply to Tud Bulul&#x2019;s queries, Tud Bulul strikes him in the nose. The man is Datu Lambon Tungo Mogow, one of Kemokul&#x2019;s children and therefore Tud Bulul&#x2019;s brother, who was once offered as a sacrifice.

But the town instantly springs back to life, and Tegedung belittles Tegingkan. Tud Bulul displays his power next and summons quakes from his habiliments and companions. The tremor and conflagration last for seven days, reaching distant lands and demolishing everything. Lambon helps Tegingkan fight the enemy, but they cannot subdue Tegedung.

Under threat, Datu Kayung reveals that the pact has been made, and Tud Bulul has gone home.

The editors followed the original spelling of texts as they were written or printed. The first volume begins with samples of folk poems: the <b>harito</b>,<b> tigmo</b>,<b> sanglitanan</b>,<b> garay</b>,<b> saloma</b>,<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\">duplo</a></b>,<b> kulilisi</b>,<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/442\">balitaw</a></b>,<b> harana</b>,<b> pamalaye</b>,<b> komposo</b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b>birso</b>.<b><i> </i></b>The poetry from the 18th century to 1940, generally following regular rhyme-and-meter schemes, consists of religious poems, love poems, patriotic poems, satirical poems, eulogies, philosophical poems, and nature poems. The 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries are represented by religious poems, like the sonnet to the Blessed Virgin Mary by Tomas de San Geronimo, 1731, and <b>gozos </b>for the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, 1888. A secular lyric poem influenced by the medieval European form is Mariano Albao Cuenco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Kinabuhi sa Usa ka Bulak&rdquo; (The Life of a Flower), ca 1905. Some poems of courtly love are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5622\">Vicente Ranudo</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hikalimtan?&rdquo; (Forget You?), 1906, and &ldquo;Pag-usara&rdquo; (Solitude), 1922; Tomas Bagyo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Damgo&rdquo; (Dream), 1907; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5523\">Escolastico Morre</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sa Daplin sa Usa ka Suba&rdquo; (On a Riverbank), ca 1910. Patriotic poems are Tomas Bagyo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Among Bandila&rdquo; (Our Flag), 1907; Francisco M. Labrador&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alang sa Nangapukan sa Kagabhion&rdquo; (For Those Who Fell in the Night), ca 1913; and Felipe B. de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Sundang&rdquo; (I Am a Bolo), 1935. Two poems that make a social comment are Priscillo Campo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Talisay,&rdquo; 1929; and &ldquo;Kinabuhing Sugbuanon&rdquo; (Cebuano Life), 1929. Contemporized adaptations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1552\">folk poems</a> are the satirical &ldquo;Piniliay sa mga Isda&rdquo; (Election of the Fishes), 1916, by A. Bello; and the lifting &ldquo;Mga Awit Gikan sa Rosas Pangdan&rdquo; (Songs from Rosas Pangdan), 1928, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3020\">Piux Kabahar</a>. Poems expressing perceptions of woman are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3137\">Amando Osorio</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bitoon sa Akong Yuta&rdquo; (Star of My Land), 1931, which eulogizes her chastity, beauty, and fragility; and Juan Solon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alang sa mga Inday&rdquo; (For the Misses), 1928, which cynically describes a woman&rsquo;s sorry lot if she marries a gambler, womanizer, or wife beater. A poem, however, that asserts the woman-poet&rsquo;s desire to transcend her human limitations is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5610\">Gardeopatra Quijano</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kon&rdquo; (If), 1936, as this excerpt shows:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&hellip; kon ako mao pa ang hangin,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oh, hadlaon ko ang mga bulak,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Isabulak ko sa tanang daplin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang mga gihay nga mangapulak,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Basin ang kahumot magpabilin,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sundon ang bahi sa magbabalak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&hellip; and if I were the wind,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Oh, I&rsquo;d tease the flowers,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">I&rsquo;d scatter to all corners</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fallen petals,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">So their fragrance would remain</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A trail of scent for the poet.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second volume contains samples that continue the poetic tradition established by the earlier periods; but modernist poems also emerged side by side with traditional forms and began to predominate in the 1970s and 1980s. There are a variety of forms like the sonnet, villanelle, free verse, blank verse, and prose poems. Indirection, emotional restraint, imagism, and more complex metaphors are used in even the earlier love poems, such as Marciano Pe&ntilde;aranda&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sa Ikaw Pay Bulak&rdquo; (When You Were Still a Flower), ca 1940, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5765\">Eugenio A. Viacrucis</a>&rsquo; &ldquo;Sa Humot Mong Buhok&rdquo; (On Your Fragrant Hair), 1954.

But there are poems too about everyday, ordinary things like a key, bowl, or pipe. Some poems wax philosophical over aspects of nature, such as high tide, the breeze, or times of the day like afternoon or evening. There are topics about people that have become part of the Cebuano historic and popular consciousness, like Lapulapu and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4224\">Yoyoy</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some poets anthologized in this second volume are Brigido B.

In 1992, Magos had recorded &ldquo;Humadapnon sa Tarangban,&rdquo; as chanted by Preciosa &ldquo;Lola Susa&rdquo; Caballero, who had previously chanted it for F. Landa Jocano. However, Magos later recorded, transcribed, and translated a much longer epic cycle of Humadapnon, consisting of four episodes, and chanted by Lola Susa&rsquo;s son, Federico Caballero, and this is what she includes in <b><i>Sugidanon</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, a clear distinction between Jocano&rsquo;s <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b> and Magos&rsquo;s Sugidanon Series is that, in the <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b>, the heroes Labaw Donggon, Humadapnon, and Dumalapdap are brothers, whereas in the <b><i>Sugidanon</i></b>, Humadapnon is Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s son-in-law. Taken collectively, the 10 epics in the <b><i>Sugidanon</i></b> have characters who are related to each other in different ways but bear identical names, notably Paubari, aka Paiburong, which is the name of Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s father in one cycle, but also that of Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s brother in another, and brother-in-law in a third.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Tikum Kadlum </i></b>begins with the title character, an enchanted dog, leading its master, Datu Paiburong, to a golden bell owned by the monster Makabagting. The angry Makabagting must now be appeased by Datu Paiburong, who offers the lives of his two foster daughters, Matan-ayon and Surangga-on. They are happily received by Amburukay, a <i>muwa</i> (female hermit with supernatural powers) and Makabagting&rsquo;s sister, who raises the two girls as <i>binukot </i>(kept women) in the forest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Amburukay</i></b>, Buyong Labaw Donggon needs Amburukay&rsquo;s gold pubic hair to replace the broken string of his heirloom <i>bidya</i> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>). He succeeds in obtaining it, unaware that doing so will bind him in marriage to her. Amburukay, however, secretly intends to marry off Matan-ayon and Surangga-on to just such a man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Forthcoming books of the Sugidanon<b><i> </i></b>series are the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Derikaryong Pada (Book 3),&rdquo; Sinagnayan wishes to marry Matan-ayon, although Labaw Donggon has already given a <i>derikaryong pada</i> (gold necklace) for her bride-price. Because Labaw Donggon has repeatedly put off marriage, Matan-ayon&rsquo;s parents and the <i>manighusay</i> (arbiter), named Humadapnon, are willing to marry her off to anyone else who can match Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s gold necklace for her bride-price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Pahagunong (Book 4),&rdquo; Padilagang Bulan, Abaw&rsquo;s <i>apid</i> (second wife) gives Abaw a betel chew that transforms him into a sea turtle. Paubari, Abaw&rsquo;s brother, dutifully watches over Ayon, as his brother Abaw has instructed. One day, Pahagunon of the upper world comes down on his flying shield to snatch Ayon away, and Paubari loses to him in a long battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Kalampay (Book 5),&rdquo;<b> </b>the title character is a crab that transforms itself into an island with betel nut trees to entice Abaw&rsquo;s wife, Matan-ayon. Its master, Masangladon, then abducts her and takes her to his world beneath the sea. <i>Panday</i> (ironsmith) Katnub Magkaruruan, who is Abaw&rsquo;s brother-in-law, bores through the giant crab so that Abaw can rescue his wife. Luyong Kabig, the deity of the undersea world, settles the long-drawn battle between Abaw and Masangladon with an arrangement whereby Abaw would return Ayon to Masangladon every seven years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Sinagnayan (Book 6),&rdquo; Matan-ayon pleads with Labaw Donggon (Abaw) to bring home her sister Pinailog sa Pinggang, who is being held by Sinagnayan. On their way, Abaw must fight with Sarandihon, gatekeeper of the Bangga-an River. Abaw holds his own against Sarandihon&rsquo;s swarms of bees and flocks of <i>banog</i> (eagle-hawks) but Sarandihon finally kills him with <i>kalayo</i> (fire) and beheads him. Laonsina comes down and reveals that the two are brothers. His life restored by Sarandihon, Abaw proceeds with his quest, which is to take his sister-in-law, Pinailog, from Sinagnayan. Abaw weakens during his long battle with Sinagnayan but Sarandihon comes to his aid killing Sinagnayan&rsquo;s life force, which is in an egg in the heart of a lion in Minayonmon&rsquo;s house in the sky. Abaw victoriously sails home but a detour to Madya-as, the place of the afterlife, takes him on another quest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Balanakon (Book 7),&rdquo; Sarandihon, who resides in the sky world, bars Balanakon from sailing down Bangga-an River, which leads toward Labaw Donggon&rsquo;s territory. There is a long-drawn battle between them, and Labaw Donggon and Paubari come to Sarandihon&rsquo;s aid. Balanakon, distracted by the sight of the lovely maiden, Kamaging, is killed. Humadapnon is trying to stop Sarandihon from beheading Balanakon, when Laonsina, goddess of the upper world, intervenes and tells them they are all of the same family tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Humadapnon (Book 8),&rdquo; is divided into four episodes centering on Humadapnon and Malitong Yawa (Mali). &ldquo;Tarangban&rdquo; (Cave) is about Humadapnon&rsquo;s quest for Malitong Yawa; his imprisonment in a cave by the powerful binukot, Sinagkating Bulawan; and Mali&rsquo;s reluctant rescue of him. &ldquo;Pagbalukat ka Biday&rdquo; is about Humadapnon and Malitong Yawa&rsquo;s collaboration to recover an heirloom boat that the aswang Paglambuhan has stolen from Mali&rsquo;s parents. Mali helps Humadapnon to win by distracting Paglambuhan with her beauty. In &ldquo;Hungaw&rdquo; (Wedding), Humadapnon is accompanied by Dumalapdap when he asks for Mali&rsquo;s hand in marriage. Dumalapdap himself is smitten by Mali&rsquo;s sister, Kinangay, to whom he also proposes marriage. The wedding of Humadapnon and Mali is held. &ldquo;Ginlawan&rdquo; begins with Dumalapdap&rsquo;s courtship of a second woman and shifts to Paglambuhan&rsquo;s courtship of Malitong Yawa: Dumalapdap is persuaded by his brother Humadapnon to cross the seas to woo Abyang Alon. While he is away, his wife, Kinangay, gives birth. The baby is placed in a basket and floated on the sea toward Dumalapdap. In the absence of the two brothers, Paglambuhan, the aswang, is about to wed Malitong Yawa, when the enraged Humadapnon suddenly appears and kills Mali. Mali&rsquo;s father, Ginlawodan, appeases him, and Laonsina restores Mali back to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Alayaw (Book 9)&rdquo; tells the start of Humadapnon&rsquo;s courtship of Malitong Yawa, daughter of Labaw Donggon and Matan-ayon. He is helped by the <i>alayaw</i>, an enchanted tree, and three messenger birds: Banog, Parupagayong, and Punay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Nagbuhis (Book 10),&rdquo; Ayon, Abaw&rsquo;s wife, now an aged woman, is mother of Malitong Yawa. Her frailty compels her to hold a <i>buruhisan</i> ritual, in which she must communicate with her long neglected ancestral spirits. On this occasion, she will also transfer to her daughter Malitong Yawa, aka Mali, the supernatural powers that she inherited from her own mother, the goddess Laonsina. However, Humadapnon, Mali&rsquo;s husband, forbids her from going because, as Mali will later discover, he has been courting several binukot at the place where the buruhisan ritual is to be held. Mali transforms into a magic pillow and flirts with several men while, at the same time, her grandmother Laonsina takes her up to the sky at her request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2000, chanter Federico &ldquo;Tuohan&rdquo; Caballero received the Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan (GAMABA) award. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

It is composed of 120 poems divided into four sections, &ldquo;Ini an mga Buhay Ta&rdquo;<i> </i>(Our Lives), &ldquo;Kanta kan Dai Natutunong na Uran&rdquo;<i> </i>(Song of the Ceaseless Rain),<i> </i>&ldquo;Hiling Palaog&rdquo;<i> </i>(Looking In),<i> </i>and &ldquo;Turog Na an Gabos&rdquo;<i> </i>(All Are Asleep).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Borlagdan&rsquo;s poems take the readers back to the time of myths, as in &ldquo;An Panga&rdquo; (Jaws), told from the viewpoint of the monster boar killed by Baltog, the first legendary king of Bikol.It is a universe both massive and mysterious, where dogs pray and bay, and where the <i>halas</i>, the Great Serpent, is caressed by the stars. Nevertheless, his language anchors these images to a local and recognizable geography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The struggle for one to be understood given the different languages in the region is gleaned in &ldquo;Bikolana&rdquo; (Bikol Maiden), in which the persona meets a fellow Bikol woman whose language he cannot understand, and &ldquo;An Estranghero&rdquo; (The Stranger), in which the title character is welcomed for the word he brings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There is a rush of metaphors in &ldquo;Muya Ko Pa an Lawas na Ini?&rdquo; (Do I Still Want This Body?), where the persona compares the body to a house, vehicle, and clothes. In &ldquo;Kun Nata Ako Nagbabaklay&rdquo; (Why I&rsquo;d Rather Walk), distance is likened to a snake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">History and myth interweave to define the cultural identity of Borlagdan&rsquo;s community. In &ldquo;An Istorya Ninda, An Osipon Ta&rdquo;<i> </i>(Their Story, Our Tale), the poet uses images of &ldquo;hadi&rdquo; (king), &ldquo;krus&rdquo; (cross), and &ldquo;espada&rdquo; (sword) to assert his community&rsquo;s sovereignty, which, however, he also describes as being permanently wounded by an embedded sword (&ldquo;may nakatadok na espada&rdquo;). Thus <b>istorya</b> in the title may also mean &ldquo;history&rdquo; and <b>osipon</b>, &ldquo;myth.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Tito G.

In &ldquo;Tsuper at Makinista&rdquo; (Driver and Train Operator), the objectivity of a news report and the emotionalism of a poetic apostrophe are interwoven to convey the horror of a collision of bus and train that is caused by government negligence.

Lucente picks up the same theme in &ldquo;Baga Durogas Ngan Baga Tinuod&rdquo; (Like a Joke That Seems True), where he asserts that the people&rsquo;s taste for pig slop and their desire to make millionaires of the Chinese in Tacloban account for the persistence of unsanitary restaurants in Tacloban.

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemheadLIT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">(The Kingdom of Keboklagan). Published 1980. Transcriber, Gaudiosa Martinez Ochotorena, &ldquo;Ag Tobig nog Keboklagan,&rdquo; <b><i>Kinaadman </i></b>3:343-543.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is perhaps one of the oldest <b>guman</b> or epics of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> of Zamboanga in Mindanao. Its contents suggest that it has not been touched by either Christian nor Muslim influences. As with other guman, <b><i>Ag</i></b> <b><i>Tobig nog</i></b><i> <b>Keboklagan</b> </i>is chanted during <i>buklog </i>or<i> </i>festivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This epic contains many of the same magical elements found in another Subanon epic, <b><i>Keg Sumba neg <strong>Sandayo</strong> </i></b>(The Tale of Sandayo). However, unlike <b><i>Sandayo</i></b>, which focuses on the establishment and maintenance of ties, <b><i>Ag Tobig nog Keboklagan</i></b><i> </i>centers on the relationship between the Subanon and the other communities in Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Doctor Gaudiosa Ochotorena, a retired administrator of the Western Mindanao State University in Zamboanga City, discovered the epic while she was attending a buklog in Sindangan, Zamboanga del Sur. Ochotorena&rsquo;s principal source for this guman was an elderly village chanter named Liyos Ambog, born in Barrio Lipakan, Salug, Zamboanga del Norte. She began to chant the epic at early evening, continued into the night, and ended past midnight, pausing for an occasional drink of <i>pangasi</i> rice wine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Liyos Ambog claimed that she had learned the guman from her mother Anaya. Anaya, in turn, had learned it from her mother, Sapar, who was only six when she learned the song. According to Liyos Ambog, the epic can be sung to another melody and with the accompaniment of Subanon musical instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The guman begins with Timoway&rsquo;s quandary as to how to support his wife who is about to give birth. He decides to earn money by being a whetter of tools in the neighboring villages. He leaves Sirangan with his assistant Kasangolan and 15 datus. However, their boat refuses to move until Timoway beheads one of his companions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the village Batotobig, Datu Sakanbar decides to join Timoway, although his wife, like Timoway&rsquo;s, is pregnant. While they are cruising, Diwata Pegderaman&mdash;the goddess of wind, lightning, and thunder&mdash;invites them to her abode to chew <i>mamaq</i> or<i> </i>betel nut. Rejected by the datus, she creates a storm that breaks Timoway&rsquo;s vessel and kills Timoway and his companions. The broken and now empty vessel returns to Sirangan. Learning about the incident, Timoway&rsquo;s wife, Balo Libon, cries so intensely that she gives birth to a boy. At this same instance, Sakadanbar&rsquo;s wife in Batotoy also gives birth to a boy. Balo Libon names her son Taake. He grows quickly, and after seven months, Taake asks about his father. When he is told that his father&rsquo;s death was not caused by a mortal, he is happy. Learning that his father was a fisher, Taake asks for his father&rsquo;s hook and line. With the aid of his magic, he establishes himself as an excellent fisher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One day, Taake, now a young man, asks his mother for clothes to go deep-sea fishing. The request surprises her, for Taake has never asked for clothes. Questioned, he explains that he is embarrassed to be naked in the company of ladies. Balo Libon then grooms her son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At sea, Taake hooks a fish with golden scales, but it drags him farther and farther away from the shore. The tug-of-war lasts for months, until an eel warns Taake to go home and offers him help to get there. But Taake only kills the eel. A storm develops, and Taake sinks. He sees a shore under the sea and sets foot on it. Finding a horse with his hook-and-line in its mouth, he pursues it with his <i>karisan </i>or sword, but the animal escapes him. Taake has reached Keboklagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taake sees a tower. He climbs a ladder with golden rungs to reach the top of the tower. There, he finds a woman, nearly naked, sewing. Called the Lady of Pintawan, she invites him to chew mamaq. As they chew, their eyes meet and exchange messages of love. Taake courts her for seven days. Finally, the Lady of Pintawan accepts Taake&rsquo;s offer of marriage. However, the romance is blocked by two men, Towan Salip and Sorotan Domatong, who abhor the idea of the Lady of Pintawan&rsquo;s marrying a Subanon. The two rally the folks of Keboklagan and urge them to kill Taake. The Lady of Pintoqan, a close friend of the Lady of Pintawan, learns about the plot and flies on her <i>monsala</i> or scarf to the Lady of Pintawan&rsquo;s place. She advises Taake to take his wife to Sirangan. Taake, however, insists on his innocence and refuses to leave Keboklagan. He fights the people who attack him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Sirangan, the datu Tomitib Manaon dreams of a lone Subanon fighting in Keboklagan. When he awakes, he prepares to help Taake, whom he discovers has been away from Sirangan for a long time. Accompanied by two other datus, he proceeds to Keboklagan. Although they lose their way at first, they finally arrive at Keboklagan, following Taake&rsquo;s route. Tomitib impetuously rushes into battle, killing Sorotan Domatong. Taake reproaches Tomitib for fighting without first asking for the reason for the fight. Saulagya Maola, the datu of Keboklagan and the Lady of Pintawan&rsquo;s brother, arrives. The ladies of Keboklagan explain to him the cause of the fight. He recalls his promise to his sister that anyone or anything that can climb the ladder with rungs of blades shall be his sister&rsquo;s husband. Saulagya Maola tells the two datus about the promise, but they insist on fighting. Saulagya, therefore, divides his kingdom between those who decide to fight and those who decide to withdraw from the battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tomitib Manaon asks Saulagya Maola if he can marry the Lady of Pintoqan. But because of his incivility, she rejects Tomitib. Tomitib runs back to the crowd and starts fighting. Datu Liyo-liyo, hearing about the fight, rides his horse and proceeds to the battleground. Datu Liyo-liyo engages Tomitib in a hand-to-hand battle. Eventually, the datu of Sirangan defeats the datu of Keboklagan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The two datus then proceed to other kingdoms to fight further. First, they challenge the chief of Dibaloy, Datu Bataqelo. Lilang Diwata, his sister, renames Taake Malompyag, or &ldquo;he who fights in all places.&rdquo; Taake and Tomitib would have exterminated the whole kingdom had not compassion overtaken them after half of the population had fallen to their sword. In Todongtodong, Taake and Tomitib are invited by its chief to chew mamaq before they start fighting. After the chew, they annihilate the kingdom. The datus then proceed to Walo Sabang, ruled by Egdodan Magsorat and Egdodan Sabagan, who themselves do not fight. Their subjects, however, are sufficient, for they get resurrected after having been killed. Taake tires after seven months of fighting and falls asleep, leaving Tomitib to fight alone. In Taake&rsquo;s dream, a girl instructs him to disguise himself as Towan Salip Palasti and to go to the tower of Walo Sabang to get magical medicines by which to prevent the enemies from coming back to life. When he awakes, he does as instructed, and he and Tomitib defeat the army of Walo Sabang. At one point in the battle, Tomitib falls dead, but the women of Keboklagan restore him to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The massive destruction disturbs the god Asog. He descends to the earth and reprimands the Sirangan. He instructs them to go home and hold a buklog, in which each of them will be given his partner. Asog fans his kerchief, bringing the dead to life. The two datus return to Sirangan, where Taake finds his mother dying of longing for him. He kisses her and she revives. All the datus of the different kingdoms are invited to a buklog, and Asog gives each of them a partner in life. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Servando Halili Jr</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Source</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Ochotorena, Gaudiosa Martinez. 1981. &ldquo;Ag Tobig nog Keboklagan.&rdquo; <em>Kinaadman </em>3:343-543.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

A cripple searching for something calls on St. Anthony, the patron of lost things. The object is found. The speaker believes that the saint himself walked to help her, her conviction strengthened by the very fact that she cannot walk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 24 poems constitute a formidable collection that introduces readers to Tiempo&rsquo;s exemplary skills in image and irony, through which she leads readers to insights.

H. Auden, T. S. Eliot, Robert Frost, and William Butler Yeats.

A few other poems incorporate elements of local color&mdash;myth, folklore, and images of the natural world&mdash;reinforced by a strong narrative line. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Danilo Francisco M.

The cycle that is summarized here focuses on the circumstances of Tud Bulul&rsquo;s birth and recounts certain episodes in his childhood and youth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kemokul and his wife Lenkonul have grown old together childless. As he chews betel nut, Kemokul expresses a longing to be young again. Lenkonul soon becomes pregnant. Their son is born full grown and already bringing his weapons and material wealth with him. Kemokul names him Tudbulul, or &ldquo;the datu with a shield in his hand.&rdquo; Right away, Kemokul wants to teach Tudbulul to swim, hunt, make a bird trap, and other such skills of manhood. One day, he carries Tudbulul in a <i>malong</i> (tube skirt) slung across his chest and goes hunting for the spotted boar. He leaves Tudbulul on a white rock and pursues the boar but it eludes him. When Kemokul returns for him, Tudbulul is gone. He and Lenkonul fear that Tudbulul would perish in the wilds. In his mind&rsquo;s eye, Kemokul perceives Tudbulul on the back of the spotted boar as they cross the sea and the realms of Kayung and Mugul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the next episode of the narration, Kenaban, the princess of the bamboo fields and Tudbulul&rsquo;s sister, sits outside the house with a folded malong<i> </i>on her head while Tudbulul carries the container of the cooked boar. Envious, Tudbulul asks for something to place on his head, too. He then wants to go upstairs but he is too small. He wails and people help him up. To soothe the crying Tudbulul, Kemokul grants his son&rsquo;s wish for the lid of a <i>kobong</i> (bamboo water container). But Tudbulul continues to sob, this time because of a premonition. He has seen that he would die in raging floodwaters that would come down upon their house. He wraps the lid of the kobong<i> </i>in his clothes and sets off on a journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Datu Sendangan, Tudbulul&rsquo;s enemy, invites Datu Lintang to visit Tudbulul&rsquo;s dwelling. Datu Lintang, Tudbulul&rsquo;s friend, declines for he knows that Tudbulul has a problem and lives a solitary life near a <i>kenalum </i>seedling. Datu Sendangan insists on going. A female horse also wants to go to Tudbulul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As he journeys on, Tudbulul remains deep in thought about the premonition of his death. He meets Datu Sewaga, the dragon, which allows Tudbulul to take out its tooth to serve as an amulet. Tudbulul next meets Datu Sowu, a snake, which also gives him its tooth for an amulet. Tudbulul arrives at a house, where the resident old woman warns him to avoid the right side of the house. There sleeps an old man who is a <i>busaw</i> (malevolent spirit).<i> </i>Tudbulul ignores the warning and passes through the right side where he meets another old woman, who warns him not to awaken the old man. Despite all the admonitions, Tudbulul goes and tries to wake up the old man by riding on his head, standing on his chest, and finally pulling out a hair from his nose. The old man awakens and furiously tries to cut Tudbulul with his <i>kefilan</i> (cutlass) but Tudbulul&rsquo;s amulets protect him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When both have calmed down, Tudbulul asks the old man, who is actually his grandfather, to go with him to Lunay Mogul, aka Lemlunay. The old man assents on condition that Tudbulul guess his true name. Tudbulul does, so the old man gives Tudbulul his horse and sets off for Lunay Mogul with Tudbulul.

One morning, Tudbulul of the tattooed arms tells his eight sisters that he has dreamt of tattoo artist Lemfayan, whom he now desires to visit. His sister Kenaban disapproves, for Lemfayan is already married. Tudbulul protests that he will always be melancholy until he wins her. He puts on his best clothes and calls for his horse, Keunting. Even the horse disapproves, but Tudbulul has his way. Tudbulul bids his sisters to keep Lemlunay in order; otherwise, their enemies will realize that he is away and take advantage of his absence. Kenaban, in turn, reminds Tudbulul to take care; otherwise, only his name would return to Lemlunay. Before leaving, Tudbulul looks into the room of his father Kemokul and his mother Lenkonul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On his way, Tudbulul rides through the domain of the maiden Solok Minum, who is hoping to be his wife. She prepares her house in anticipation of his visit and sends her sister, Selutan, to inquire of Tudbulul what merrymaking he is off to. Tudbulul evasively replies that he is just looking for a gong and a <i>malong</i> (tube skirt). Solok Minum offers Tudbulul betel chew, which he refuses because he must proceed with his journey. Solok Minum hopes to go with him when he returns to Lemlunay but Tudbulul tactfully lets her down by saying that he is undeserving of her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Keunting the horse is still reluctant to proceed and Tudbulul agrees that their journey is fraught with danger, but he insists that he will take up any challenge coming his way. Tudbulul meets Datu Bigul But Bulul, who is on his way to Lemlunay. Tudbulul tries to dissuade the datu from proceeding, saying that there are only elderly women there. The datu does not believe Tudbulul, and they fight with shields that shoot out fire and whirlwinds. They also exchange snide comments. After a prolonged battle, Tudbulul lets out a victory cry, mounts Keunting, and continues his journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">They cross fields of cogon, the place of withered leaves, the gorge of tattoos, and the forest of rings until they are stopped by the sound of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>. The fearful Keunting reminds Tudbulul of Kenaban&rsquo;s warning that only their names will return to Lemlunay. They meet Datu Tikel Son Buteng, who says he is on his way to Lemlunay, where only defenseless maidens live. Incensed, Tudbulul shakes his shield, from which shoots out a ball of fire, striking Datu Tikel&rsquo;s headdress. Datu Botong Bulul appears, interrupts the fight, and says that he will wait for Tudbulul at the gathering. Tudbulul journeys on until he reaches the moving mountains. He sees threadlike smoke coming from the woods. Something sitting on a ladder has a pair of eyes as large as plates, and its face appears to have collided with a large tree or have been flattened like a gong. It demands to know his identity, and Tudbulul obliges. The person blocking his way is Datu Sakung Lembulul. Its nose is as large as a wine jar, its eyes as large as a comb, and in its hand is a stick. The man challenges Tudbulul to guess his name as proof that Tudbulul is really Kemokul and Lenkonul&rsquo;s son. After a long silence, Tudbulul guesses correctly that the man is Datu Sekung Lembulul. He is the brother of Kemokul, who gave him this house in the faraway mountains because he is a <i>busaw</i> (evil spirit). Tudbulul weeps for joy at having found his uncle, and Datu Sekung Lembulul is glad he has not killed his nephew. He invites Tudbulul in for drinks. The house is full of busaw with glowing eyes, which frighten Keunting. Datu Sekung gives Tudbulul his shield that came from the <i>limuhan</i> (an omen bird) and decorated with flowers, as well as his kris. He advises Tudbulul to disguise himself in humble clothing, to leave all his things behind, including Keunting, and to ride to the gathering on a lowly female carabao. Tudbulul assents, although he declares he will carry his own name into the gathering. He has also heard his uncle, the busaw, being called Mumuy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Tudbulul arrives, gongs are playing, many shields are there, and a horse fight is going on. Lemfayen sees Tudbulul and thinks he might be the busaw Mumuy. Tudbulul tethers his carabao to a tree and leans against the shields. Lemfayen gazes at him from head to toe and then prepares a betel chew with extraordinary care. The women chastise her, calling Tudbulul &ldquo;Fu Lutuy,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;the man without wealth or shield.&rdquo; Lemfayan replies that betel chew is not solely for men with tattooed chests or men with power. She then enters the room where the gongs are kept and puts on her best clothes and finery. Again, she offers Tudbulul her betel chew, but he only reproves her for mocking his manhood, saying he is but a weak, old man with no <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2118\">tattoo </a>on his chest. Lemfayen retorts that she is free to choose her company, but she has already begun to suspect that he might be Tudbulul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tudbulul&rsquo;s carabao is about to move toward him when he commands her to stay quiet lest he be discovered. He sends her back to his uncle, Datu Sekung Lembulul, for his horse, Keunting. In the meantime, the women are laughing and sneering at him. Keunting arrives and kisses Tudbulul&rsquo;s shield in greeting but Tudbulul asks him not to reveal himself just yet. A ball of fire rolls in and a strong earthquake rocks the land. The merrymaking is suddenly stilled. Keunting makes his appearance, looking magnificent with head of gold and bearing Tudbulul&rsquo;s paraphernalia. Tudbulul sheds his disguise, and the ball of fire strikes Lemfayan&rsquo;s hair. The women exclaim in regret at their obtuseness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lemfayan&rsquo;s husband is the powerful Nga Datu Neben Lobun, the datu with the flaming shield and whose head is a meter wide. No one, not even Tudbulul, can defeat him. Declaring that he will not be shaken, Tudbulul asks Lemfayan to dance for him. Nga Datu Neben Lobun angrily asserts his rights as Lemfayen&rsquo;s husband. Tudbulul delivers a boastful speech and provokes Nga Datu Neben Lobun to a duel, declaring that if he destroys the datu&rsquo;s shield, he will take Lemfayan back to Lemlunay with him. As their krises and shields clash, the two mock each other, but it is a long, drawn out fight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Datu Sakung Lembulul is hurrying to the scene of battle. He stops the fight and reveals that Nga Datu Neben Lobun is his son. The two rivals are therefore first cousins. A woman, he adds, is not worth the fight, for she is but a head of hair; on the other hand, a fight between relatives would bring down a curse on them. Nga Datu Neben Lobun offers Lemfayan to Tudbulul in exchange for Keunting and his large gongs, which contain Tudbulul&rsquo;s fire. Tudbulul assents, for to refuse would make Nga Datu Neben Lobun&rsquo;s soul wander aimlessly. Tudbulul sits beside Lemfayan, who offers him betel chew. But if the <i>limuhan </i>bird sings, it bodes ill for the two, and the wedding may not proceed after all. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a> and Michael Jude Tumamac</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Tudbulul, aka Semgulang, dreams that he will die when his town Lemlunay is engulfed by fire and sea. He builds a sky-high, defensive stone wall around Lemlunay. One day, from the shade of the <i>kenalum </i>tree, Tudbulul sees the sea rising higher and higher until the water reaches up to the floor of his house. The turbulence lasts for eight days. The waves swallow up Lemlunay, along with Tudbulul and his two sisters, who both float off in another direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tudbulul dies, and his body floats into the navel of the sea, together with his sword, shield, and betel-nut box. The seventh layer, where the navel of the sea lies, breaks into a wail because Tudbulul&rsquo;s body is caught in it. Three brothers try to swallow Tudbulul&rsquo;s body by turns but they all fail because Tudbulul is too powerful. The eldest has Tudbulul&rsquo;s body taken up to his house. His daughter, Kembeyen, prepares the rites of mourning for Tudbulul. For the coffin, she must find a tree with bell-shaped leaves and golden twigs, owned by Bal Biwong. Tudbulul&rsquo;s elbow jerks up in approval at the sound of the tree&rsquo;s name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because it is not a woman&rsquo;s place to make a coffin, Kembeyen puts on Tudbulul&rsquo;s outfit, including his <i>kefilan</i> (kris) and shield. In the guise of Tudbulul, she goes to the seventh layer, where the navel of the sea lies, and there she sees a betel-nut box. She cuts the betel nut with the kris, but the kris slips and hits her pulse. Feeling very ill, she enters Kayung, the realm of those who die violently. She cuts off her pulse and promises to come back for it. She plays the <i>kulintang </i>(bossed gong) to send a message to her father to take care of Tudbulul&rsquo;s body while she is away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Datu Beniteng wonders with foreboding why his daughter is going to Kayung, because it is a place where beheaded people go, and not where people would search for a coffin. Kembeyen enters Kayung by cutting down the enchanted macopa<i> </i>tree, whose fruits fall continuously down from the branches. Soon, she sees Datu Kayung, the ruler of that realm, but he does not realize that she is a woman because she looks like Tudbulul. He invites her to his house, where she meets Insa Lenuy, Datu Kayung&rsquo;s daughter. They sit and chew betel nut together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As she is about to resume her quest for the tree, Kembeyen promises to meet Insa Lenuy at the top of the mountain on her way home. Kembeyen then proceeds to the moon to get the tree that Bal Biwong owns. It admonishes her to get only the part she needs for the coffin and to return the leaves. Kembeyen measures the wood she needs and returns to the navel of the sea, fetching her pulse, which has transformed into a woman. Between them, they carry the coffin. Insa Lenuy, princess of Kayung, joins them. They place Tudbulul&rsquo;s body inside the coffin and perform the mourning rites. Tudbulul&rsquo;s two sisters who had been swept by the flood that killed Tudbulul arrive.

Eight years pass and Kembeyen continues to protect Tudbulul&rsquo;s body with her gun until all the datus<i> </i>are finally killed by gunfire. The coffin opens and Tudbulul sits up, but he has been transformed into a shield. He thanks his sister Kenaban for her fidelity to him and asks Kembeyen to prepare a betel chew. He bids them return to Lemlunay while he must wander off to restore his good name. Kenaban and the others go home and rebuild Kenalum aka Lemlunay / Lunay Mogul.

He appears to them, and the men run away in fear, his shield chasing after them. Tudbulul runs to his house, where he tells his sister Kenaban that he will die again. He will only return to their own realm when he has gotten what his soul needs: his sword in the lake, his shield in the sky, and the chests containing fire and wind. When Tudbulul dies again, the women gather in mourning, and Kenaban consoles them by urging them to help her grant Tudbulul&rsquo;s wish.

Duyung has the weapons and the chests that Tudbulul needs. Duyung makes Heniton stay for months till she feels Heniton is old enough to return to Lemlunay. She travels with Heniton, taking all her wealth with her. Together with the sisters, they go to Tudbulul&rsquo;s room and they place the quake and fire near his head, and the sword and shield on his chest. After a few hours, Tudbulul comes back to life and everyone celebrates. Duyung tells Tudbulul that the chest will be used as a defense against the creature from the Kayung realm.

Here, another baylan, Agbangala, is Baybayan&rsquo;s alter ego, who, as he rides toward the sky in the <i>salimbal</i> (sacred vehicle), is &ldquo;knifed by lightning&rdquo; and splinters into innumerable stars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The section &ldquo;Mga Sala hu Kagtima, Gagaw, daw Agpatayan&rdquo; (Songs of Life, Love, and Death) ranges over the emotions that men are capable of: sibling misunderstanding; a man&rsquo;s eagerness to prove the fierceness of his love with his machete; the timidity of one who cannot confess his love; a datu&rsquo;s pain over an impossible love; and a man&rsquo;s boastful offer to undertake death-defying feats to prove his love.

Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> writers of the 1920s and 1930s, Collantes wrote in the tradition of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco &quot;Balagtas&quot; Baltazar</a> and the writers of the propaganda movement. Using his columns in Tagalog newspapers <b><i>Ang Watawat</i></b> and <b><i>Pagkakaisa</i></b><i> </i>as outlets for his poetry, he fulfilled the Tagalog poet&rsquo;s dual role: to delight and to teach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book ranges through the topical concerns of the era as he expresses his immediate responses to various events. Upon hearing the news that William Taft is unwell, Collantes, in &ldquo;Mabuhay si Taft&rdquo; (Long Live Taft), wishes him a speedy recovery and pleads with him to continue fighting for the Filipinos. On the other hand, he excoriates American individuals and institutions when they transgress Philippine rights and interests: the plans of presidential emissary Carmi A. Thompson to open the country&rsquo;s pristine lands to foreign exploitation in &ldquo;Ang Talumpati ni Thompson&rdquo; (Thompson&rsquo;s Speech); President Coolidge&rsquo;s proposal to grant more power to the governor-general in &ldquo;Mga Tanda ng Pangiinis&rdquo; (Signs of Suppression); a bill filed in the US Congress proposing to separate Mindanao from the rest of the Philippines in &ldquo;Tayo&rsquo;y Magsitutol&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Oppose); and an American art teacher&rsquo;s racist slur in &ldquo;Magnanakaw na Lahat ang mga Filipino&rdquo; (All Filipinos Are Thieves).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The trespasses of local executives and police are not spared. In &ldquo;Ordenansa ng Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Love Ordinance), &ldquo;Ang Pagmamapuri ng Sekreta&rsquo;t Pulis&rdquo; (The Ingratiation of the Plainclothesman and the Police), and &ldquo;Segunda Senyal Na&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Signal No. 2 Already), he rues how people use their power and influence to harass the poor rather than help them. Other subjects in his poetry include the threat to close down a cabaret, the violent and protracted series of strikes in many factories, murders, the dark side to the carnival season, and poverty-related crimes. &ldquo;Naglalagablab Na ang Aklasan&rdquo; (The Strike Is Heating Up) and &ldquo;Hubaran ang Walang Damit, Dayukdukin ang Nagugutom&rdquo; (Strip the Naked, Starve the Hungry) are Collantes&rsquo;s more powerful depictions of the people&rsquo;s sufferings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Collantes also exposes the Filipino&rsquo;s vices and various forms of misbehavior, such as boastfulness in &ldquo;Mapanirang Puri&rdquo; (Harmful Honor), fractiousness in &ldquo;Kay Hirap Tuntunin&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Hard to Apprehend), the tendency of parents to spoil their children in &ldquo;Ang Kunsintidor&rdquo; (The Indulgent One), gluttony in &ldquo;Bunga ng Katakawan&rdquo; (The Result of Rapacity), and procrastination in &ldquo;Ang Pangakong Sastre&rdquo; (The Promised Tailor). Nor does Collantes spare such deeply ingrained customs as <i>pakimkim </i>(dowry) and extravagant and financially draining fiestas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Collantes&rsquo;s romantic and personal poetry, for which he is well known, consists of his short, lyrical poems, which use objects in nature as metaphors for various aspects of life, as in &ldquo;Ang Awit ng mga Ibon&rdquo; (The Birds&rsquo; Song) and &ldquo;Ang Punongkahoy&rdquo; (The Tree); and tragic tales of betrayal and love, as in &ldquo;Pasalubong&rdquo; (Greeting).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The final section features Collantes&rsquo;s longer narrative poems, including &ldquo;Ang Lumang Simbahan&rdquo; (The Old Church), a tale of the restoration of the people&rsquo;s reverence for an old, dreaded church after two lovers found treasure buried beneath its altar, and &ldquo;Ang Tulisan&rdquo; (The Bandit).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Divided into 11 parts, the titular poem opens with a woman fearful for her husband and their son, Fidel, who have been away for two months to sell their carabaos in Nueva Ecija. She decides to seek Roman, Fidel&rsquo;s godfather, for help. Roman moved from Calumpit to Gapan after he had been accused as a bandit who had attacked the village. In Gapan, Roman has found himself a wife, but he is suspected of poisoning her for money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third and fourth parts depict the stories of Ines and her daughter Adela. After Adela gives birth to Fidel&rsquo;s child, Ines charges over to Fidel&rsquo;s house to fight for Adela&rsquo;s honor. Ines thinks that Fidel has reneged on his promise to marry Adela after he has earned enough from selling the carabaos. When Ines learns from Fidel&rsquo;s mother that father and son have been missing, her rage turns to grief, and she helps Fidel&rsquo;s mother prepare for her journey to Gapan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the seventh part, Fidel&rsquo;s mother finds Roman, who informs her that both her son and husband passed by his house on their way to sell their livestock. Roman joins the woman in her search. In the town of Mu&ntilde;oz, they meet a man who bought the last carabao from Fidel and his father. The man recalls that they intended to go to Gapan to visit a <i>kumpare</i> (son&rsquo;s godfather), who also hails from Bulacan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The search is abruptly ended when Roman attempts to rape Fidel&rsquo;s mother. She wounds Roman with a dagger, forcing him to flee into the night. Their paths intersect 18 years later, when Fidel&rsquo;s child, who has grown up unaware of Roman and his deeds, falls in love with Roman&rsquo;s niece. Surprised that Roman is still alive, Fidel&rsquo;s mother dreams of her son. She is told that he and his father were murdered by Roman and were buried near a well by his house in Gapan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the final part, she digs up the skeletons of her husband and son. Back in Calumpit, Fidel&rsquo;s mother confronts Roman, stabs him in the chest, and drags him to face the village chief. After admitting to his crimes, Roman is lynched by the villagers and is left dead, hanging from a mango tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Besides providing a comprehensive view of Collantes&rsquo;s writings, the book demonstrates how the poetic tradition inherited from Balagtas can be a source of in-depth knowledge of and insight into key moments in the nation&rsquo;s colonial history. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a> and Om Narayan Velasco</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Transcriber, E. Arsenio Manuel. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>Tuwaang</strong></i></b><i> </i>is the epic of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, a group occupying the boundary area of Cotabato, Bukidnon, and Davao in Mindanao, near the areas occupied by the Jangan and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a>. There are over 50 Tuwaang songs, but thus far, only two songs from the epic have been published. Both are in the Manobo language and are performed during wakes, weddings, thanksgiving rituals, and hunts. The first is <b><i>Mangovayt</i></b><i> <b>Buhong</b> <b>na Langit </b></i>(The Maiden of the Buhong Sky), recorded by E. Arsenio Manuel and published with an English translation in a journal in 1957. It was published in book form in 1958. A Tagalog translation, <b><i>Tuwaang: Isang Buong <strong>Awit</strong> mula sa Epikong <strong>Bagobo</strong></i></b>, ca 1972, was done by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5272\">Genoveva Edroza-Matute</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5503\">Epifanio G. Matute</a>. The other song from the epic is <b><i>Midsakop</i></b><i> <b>Tabpopawoy</b></i> (Tuwaang Attends a Wedding), recorded and published with an English translation by E. Arsenio Manuel in 1975. Manuel&rsquo;s principal source for the two songs was Saddani Pagayaw, his companion in Davao. Pagayaw dictated the songs on separate occasions. He never sang them, but learned them from one who did, a bard named Inuk, who belonged to a family of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> singers. Inuk, in turn, had learned <b><i>Midsakop Tabpopawoy </i></b>from another bard, Itam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Any song of the <b><i>Tuwaang</i></b><i> </i>epic is introduced by the singer with a proem or prelude, known to the Manobo as the <b>tabbayanon</b>,<b><i> </i></b>which, in turn, has two parts: the tabbayanon proper, which elicits interest and often expresses the singer&rsquo;s loves and dreams, and the <b>bantangon</b>,<b><i> </i></b>which announces the beginning of the song proper. The Manobo are especially receptive during epic singing. They express their reactions through the <b>ondaon</b>,<b><i> </i></b>in the form of sighs, cries, and yells. Sometimes, their reaction is expressed, within hearing of the<b><i> </i></b>singer, in words of appreciation or encouragement, from a simple word or phrase to a complete poetic line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first song is about Tuwaang getting himself a wife. He is an artisan adept at making leglets, at engraving finger rings, and at molding chains of gold. One day, he tells his sister that the wind has informed him about the Maiden of the Buhong Sky. She has come to Pinanggayungan, the country of Batooy, but she refuses to talk to any of the gallants there. Although his sister is fearful of what may result, Tuwaang soon gears himself to journey to Batooy&rsquo;s country. Transported by lightning, bedecked with his warrior&rsquo;s costume and headdress, and armed like a gallant, he becomes the object of admiration of the maidens of Pinanggayungan. He is received in the house of the Young Man of Pangavukad, who journeys with him to the house of Batooy. There, Tuwaang is received. As he lies sleeping near the Maiden of the Buhong Sky, the Maiden speaks, disrobes, and plucks a strand of Tuwaang&rsquo;s cowlick. The Maiden tells Tuwaang her story: she has been running away from the Young Man of Pangumanon, a giant whose headdress reaches the clouds, who wants to marry her. Because she rejected him, the Young Man of Pangumanon has burnt her kingdom. Pursued by the giant, she has sought shelter in the earth world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No sooner has she finished her tale when the Young Man of Pangumanon, enveloped in flames, arrives, killing Batooy&rsquo;s people. The Young Man of Pangavukad, Tuwaang&rsquo;s companion, is among the last he slays. Next, he attacks Tuwaang. The two warriors fight, but neither one of them gains an advantage. Shields are smashed, and spears and blades are broken. Then, the Young Man of Pangumanon calls on his<i> pantung</i>,<i> </i>a span-long iron bar endowed with supernatural properties, and coils it around Tuwaang. The pantung bursts into flames, but when Tuwaang raises his right hand, the fire is put out. In turn, Tuwaang calls on his own pantung, a skein of gold. He calls on the wind to fan the flames of his pantung, which engulf the Young Man of Pangumanon and kill him. Tuwaang revives the dead folks by his spittle. Then, riding the lightning, he carries the Maiden on his shoulder to his country in Kuaman. Tuwaang&rsquo;s sister greets them with betel chew. After resting for five days, a stranger brings death to Tuwaang&rsquo;s followers and challenges Tuwaang. They fight, and Tuwaang overcomes him. The hero revives his followers and takes another five-day rest. Afterward, he gathers his people to take them to the country of Katusan, the land without death and one of the heavenly layers of the sky world. The people ride the <i>sinalimba</i>,<i> </i>an airboat. Tuwaang places his sister and the Maiden on his shoulders and follows the sinalimba to Katusan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the second song, Tuwaang is a wedding guest who becomes the wedding groom. Several motifs found in the first song recur in <b><i>Midsakop Tabpopawoy</i></b>,<i> </i>such as the announcement of the problem by the wind, the lightning rides, and Tuwaang&rsquo;s making friends along his way. Tuwaang tells his aunt that the wind has informed him about the wedding of the Maiden of Manawon. Although the aunt foresees trouble, he is determined to attend the wedding, having given his word. He prepares himself for the journey, taking with him his blade, his dagger, his shield, and his spear. Riding the lightning, he arrives at the <i>kawkawangan</i> grassland, where he rests and hears a bird crowing. He decides to catch it, but sees that it is the <i>gungutan</i>,<b> </b>a<b><i> </i></b>magical bird with a spur made of a dagger. The gungutan joins Tuwaang. They shake their shoulders, and, by so doing, they are carried into space to the site of the wedding. Admitted into the hall, Tuwaang sits on a golden stool, and the gungutan perches on a crossbeam. People hear pleasant sounds from afar and see the trees start flowering. These signal the arrival of the Young Man of Panayangan, who sits on a golden stool. Other gallants arrive: the Young Man of Liwanon, the Young Man of the Rising Sun, and the Young Man of Sakadna, who is the groom, accompanied by a hundred attendants. Haughtily, he tells the houseowner to drive the &ldquo;dirt&rdquo; away from the house, referring to the people who do not matter. Tuwaang retorts that there are also &ldquo;red leaves&rdquo;&mdash;that is, heroes&mdash;in the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The preliminaries of the wedding ceremony start. All but two of the <i>savakan</i>,<i> </i>or<i> </i>bride articles and wrapped food to be paid for by the groom&rsquo;s kinsfolk, are offered and redeemed. One has the value of an ancient gong with 10 bosses and nine relief-rings. The groom confesses his inability to pay for all these, but Tuwaang saves him from embarrassment by taking his place. Tuwaang&rsquo;s magic breath produces a more ancient <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>. The other savakan is redeemable only by a golden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/832\">zither</a> and a golden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>, both of which Tuwaang immediately<b><i> </i></b>produces. The bride is now asked to come out of her chamber and serve betel chew. She tells her betel chew to go around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Everyone is served, the betel chew jumping into the mouths of the guests. Two pieces of chew leap into the groom&rsquo;s mouth, but when the betel box reaches Tuwaang, it stops, although Tuwaang brushes it away. The bride decides to sit beside Tuwaang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Young Man of Sakadna blushes and challenges Tuwaang to a fight in the yard. After the bride has unrolled Tuwaang&rsquo;s hair, combed it, and knotted it, Tuwaang and the Young Man of Sakadna fight in the yard. The gungutan, meanwhile, has been fighting and killing many of the groom&rsquo;s party. Soon, only Tuwaang and the Young Man of Sakadna are left moving about. The Young Man of Sakadna hurls Tuwaang at a boulder, which crumbles to dust. The goddess Mahomanay complains because the earth is shaking, and trees are getting bent from the fighting. Tuwaang gets hold of his foe and slams him so hard on the ground that he penetrates the underworld, where he meets one of its caretakers. But the Young Man of Sakadna surfaces quickly. In turn, he thrusts Tuwaang into the earth. Tuwaang sinks to the underworld and speaks to one of the caretakers. The caretaker tells him how to overcome his foe. Resurfacing, Tuwaang asks the Young Man of Sakadna to be his vassal, warning the Young Man that he now knows how to win the battle. The Young Man refuses. After Tuwaang is rejected anew, he summons the golden flute in which the Young Man keeps his life. Because the groom prefers death to enslavement, Tuwaang crushes the flute, thus killing the Young Man of Sakadna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Accompanied by the gungutan, Tuwaang takes the bride to Kuaman where he rules forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aspects of Manobo culture can be seen in <b><i>Tuwaang</i></b>.<i> </i>An example involves the savakan, or bridewealth. Once a match is made, the groom&rsquo;s relatives and parents must raise the bridewealth; otherwise the groom may lose his bride. In <b><i>Midsakop Tabpopawoy</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the redemption of the savakan by Tuwaang, a<b><i> </i></b>guest, provides the motivation for Tuwaang to replace the groom. This is the crux of the epic. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by E.

Agyu and his relatives are the subject. A conflict develops between them and their rulers, usually the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\\\\\">Maguindanaon</a>, because of a forced tribute and the killing of the ruler. They flee, guided by a <i>diwata </i>(spirit-guardian), who promises them immortality after they have overcome various obstacles. They leave behind Mungan, the wife of Banlak who is Agyu&rsquo;s brother, because she has leprosy. Mungan, however, is the first among them to become immortal. It is she who tells Agyu and the clan to go to Aruman to await the<i> sarimbar</i>/<i>salimbar </i>(magical flying boat), which will take them to paradise. When the appointed day comes, Agyu and his relatives ascend to heaven. A diwata<i> </i>showers them with the oil of immortality and gives them the betel nut of immortality to chew. He blesses them but tells them that the Midlimbag, the Highest God, sends them to live in Nalandangan, an earthly paradise, and not in heaven. That is their reward for enduring and having confidence in the Midlimbag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, Baybayan, Agyu&rsquo;s son, does not join them in Nalandangan. Agyu and his grandfather have decreed that he must circle the world seven times to convert people, as a consequence of his absence from two communal feasts. In his wanderings, Baybayan encounters many adventures, converting many peoples, including Chinese and Muslims. In one episode, his followers run out of food and drink. Baybayan performs the first ulahing by a tree laden with fruits, which drop and turn into <i>linepet</i>,<i> </i>leaf-wrapped rice; a bowl of viand appears beside it. Baybayan and his followers feast on the food, which does not run out. After more wanderings, they are finally flown on a salimbar up to heaven, where they become immortal. Midlimbag gives them powers different from those of Agyu and provides them with another paradise to stay in. He exhorts Baybayan to inspire mortals to perform the ulahing so that they may not forget Agyu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sengedurug in volume 1 is &ldquo;The Visit of Lagabaan to Nalandangan,&rdquo;<i> </i>a summary of which follows: Nalandangan is the later name of an ancient fortress city, aka Yendang, Menengneng, Libalan, and Newili-an. A chosen people, loved by the Highest God of the sky world, dwell in the fortress city. They have come from Aruman&mdash;now identified as a barrio within the municipality of Carmen, North Cotabato&mdash;by riding a huge ship. This fact hints that they might have used the Cotabato River and sailed toward some place in northern Mindanao, believed to be Cagayan de Oro City today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The people build the huge city along the seashore at the river mouth. It is fenced by tree trunks that are taken from various islands of the archipelago and glued together with a python&rsquo;s saliva. The pillars of Agyu&rsquo;s house are tree trunks so big that eight persons are needed to link hands around each one and eight persons can lie on top of each. The beams point to the east, their tips decked with statues of reptiles carved with their mouths open, daggerlike teeth exposed. The roof of the house is thatched with mermaid&rsquo;s hair and the locks of the deity Alimugkat, goddess of the seas; it is also layered with grass from the sky world. On the eaves is a frieze of dazzling, red statues of warriors; and on top of the building are two warriors of gold, each armed with a spear, a shield, and a buckler, both poised for battle. West of the building is a statue of a beautiful maiden washing herself in a stream; in the east, a statue of a golden eagle with wings outspread. The city has a courtyard of silver and a playground of glass. On the battlefield is a mountain of discarded shields and bucklers, spear shafts, and uprooted trees. Scattered around are teeth and skulls. Agyu&rsquo;s room, called the <i>bengyasan</i>,<i> </i>is coated with paint nine times over. The bathing place of the maidens is fenced by boulders to keep away sharks and crocodiles. The floor is made of silver; the inside wall, of glass. There are bathing places for the married women, for Agyu the hero, and for the young men. They never remove their armors when they bathe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nalandangan also has fortifications. Each of the well-known warriors&mdash;Kuyasu, nephew of Agyu; Seyluwen, the son; Piglibu, the brother; Banlak/Vanlak, another brother; Nebeyaw, another son; and Agyu&mdash;is assigned a fort. Agyu&rsquo;s fort is built of iron and steel and provided with a cover on which 10 men can perform the <i>sa-ut</i> (war dance).<i> </i>Invaders reach no farther than the opening of the fort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One morning, Lena/Lono convenes the people to an assembly. Agyu has just wakened from a long sleep and now recounts to the assembly an ominous dream about the darkness and destruction of Nalandangan. Pigyugung/Pemulew, Agyu&rsquo;s older brother, likewise dreams that invaders have come. But Lena, sure of victory, is unperturbed. When the invader-s arrive, Lena orders the young people to arm themselves, and they do so eagerly. Darkness envelops the fortress of Nalandangan, and Vanlak, the younger brother of Agyu, shouts that he will lead the attack. Agyu&rsquo;s son, Nebeyew, fights the invaders, who fall like fruit from a tree. But when he raises his arm, a flame comes from it and reveals that the enemy&rsquo;s magic iron rod is disabling and devouring many of Agyu&rsquo;s followers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lena arms himself, with the orioles hovering over his plume, signifying that his diwata<i> </i>is guiding and protecting him. He instructs his shield and buckler to be firmly rooted to the foundation of the underworld. The enemy&rsquo;s magic iron rod mocks him with a warning that he might be blown by a storm or swallowed up by a mighty wind. The iron rod withdraws to the sea and then trots back to the battle field, knocking Lena&rsquo;s shield and buckler to pieces. Lena grapples with the rod and throws it into space. The rod devastates every kingdom that it passes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rod returns with a vengeance and tries vainly to gnaw Lena&rsquo;s slender waist. Lena grabs the rod, and, locked together, they spin, until Lena smashes it against the hardwood trees and the cliff, turning them into a wasteland. Lena&rsquo;s diwata turns his legs into sharp swords and his limbs into sabers. With them, he splinters the iron monster. A fleet of invading ships appears, carrying a thousand troops and their king. They destroy Yendang, and its people are fettered on the decks of the ships. Lena frees them by simply touching their chains. The people are transported back to the spacious courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A toddler welcomes the elderly king to Yendang. As the king sits at the portal of the courtyard, he sees his own ships being smashed to pieces. The king only encourages his followers to continue destroying Yendang. Lena drives the invaders back to the seashore. The two warring sides engage in a contest of shouts and banging noises. Then, at Lena&rsquo;s command, his followers dance the sa-ut as a prelude to the battle. The Yendang warriors of all ages chase the enemies to the mountains and decimate them. The king&rsquo;s aide plants his shield in the middle of the field, and it becomes a protective cliff for the invading warriors. The shield is knocked away and Delemenen spears the king&rsquo;s aide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The king commands his anklets and ringlets to ring the place so that it becomes impenetrable. The king&rsquo;s shield and buckler grow bigger until they are fastened to the gilded beams of the palace, becoming a blocking cliff. Lena performs the sa-ut and kicks the obstacles away. He presses on the planted shield and buckler of the king, who taunts him. But the shield and the buckler are giving way, like ropes snapping. Lena soon turns them into splinters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lena fights with the king and grinds the king&rsquo;s various weapons to dust. The two wrestle, and a cloud of smoke appears in their midst, but neither one of them yields. Lena hurls himself skyward to take the <i>sipa </i>(ball of the sky), with which he encases the king, who, however, easily frees himself. The king binds Lena&rsquo;s feet with shackles that are attached to a gigantic tree and a balete tree, whose trunk fastens itself to the land of the dead and the gilded beam of the palace. Lena frees himself and hurls the king into space. But the king returns to the courtyard and binds Lena with the hair of a deity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tigyekuwa, Agyu&rsquo;s first wife, and their son Kumugpa arrive from another land and they come upon the bound Lena. Tigyekuwa&rsquo;s touch frees him. She also identifies Lena&rsquo;s adversary as his true father, who has never visited Nalandangan before. The king&rsquo;s eyes moisten, unable to recognize the multitude of his children, his grandchildren, and his great great grandchildren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Volume 2 contains two sengedurug. The first, &ldquo;The Adventures of Impehimbang and Nebeyew,&rdquo; has a toddler of Nalandangan defeating innumerable enemies, whose king holds the people of Nalandangan captive in the hold of his ship. The second is &ldquo;Begyasan&rsquo;s Visit to Insibey,&rdquo; which centers on the two warrior princesses, Tabagka and Yambungan, who save their chieftain Mendeyawi, aka Agyu, and his warriors from defeat in a battle with invaders. The princess Yambungan then instigates a battle with Agyu himself and his warriors. During their duel, Agyu senses imminent defeat, so he makes a convenient exit by leaving his shield to take his place while he takes a nap under a boulder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Volume 3 consists of two episodes. In the first, &ldquo;The Dream of Begyasan,&rdquo; Nalandangan is invaded by a man-eating, black giant and then by an army of invaders, led by an elderly chieftain. In the end, it is revealed that the giant and elderly chieftain are one and the same, and that he is the ancestor of Agyu and his people, who come to teach them the warrior&rsquo;s code. In the second, &ldquo;The Golden Tree,&rdquo; Begyasan, aka Agyu, pines to death for the golden tree. Pinuklew is tasked to obtain the tree, which is in the realm of Melekdayen. After overcoming many obstacles with his magic amulets, Pinuklew triumphantly returns to Yendang. Revived, Begyasan wants the golden tree returned to its rightful owner, Yambungan. The king of Melekdayen leads an invasion of Udanan, aka Nalandangan, to retrieve the golden tree. Finally, the diwata of peace, Lagabaan, stops the fight with a reprimand for the Melekdayen king and praise for Begyasan, who has rightly recognized Yambungan&rsquo;s right to the tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Volume 4 is a kepu-unpu-un (prologue), which tells the story of the Creation. The Yegpinted (Creator) begins the creation, first, of the multiple layers of the sky and the heavenly bodies. Land is formed when he separates the ocean from the sea. The Yegpinted begins to populate the earth with the creation of Limbagan, the first man, and Imba-al, the first woman. After eating the forbidden fruit, they are punished with a constant hunger, which compels them to wander the earth for food. Mercifully, the Yegpinted sends his secondary gods to help the couple survive. Thus begins the human life of house building, agriculture, procreation, and their attendant anxieties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Volume 5 gathers three versions of the Creation myth, in which the constant element is the bird that gathers the soil from which the land formations will grow. In the first version, the universe is a collaborative creation of several gods, although they defer to a Supreme Being. The earth&rsquo;s foundation is a giant iron pillar, but the sun and sky are placed too low until the Supreme Being&rsquo;s son-in-law raises it. Misery and death plague the human race after the Supreme Being allows the god of evil spirits to live as a human being on earth. Hence, the merciful Supreme Being sends down several spirit guardians, each with a specific function to help people survive in the various aspects of their lives. In the second version, the giant pillar is the earth&rsquo;s rotating center which is held fast to the sea. Plants are created first to provide medicine for the human race yet to be conceived. The first man and woman are created, but they eat the forbidden fruit and are punished with mortality. The human race multiplies quickly until the Supreme Being sends his ring to call them to an assembly so as to establish institutions of social order: the defining of land boundaries, the selection of leaders, and the duties of each individual to their community. The third version has the Creator sending his ring to call his secondary gods to an assembly, where he commands them to look after the earth. There is a flashback to the details of the creation process. Then the Supreme Being sends his <i>tubao</i> (headdress) to call for a second assembly, in which he assigns each deity to a specific function in keeping the universe in order. The myth ends with the chanter&rsquo;s song of praise for the Creator&rsquo;s power and artistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An analysis of Maquiso&rsquo;s <b><i>Ulahingan</i></b> is included in the chapter &ldquo;The Epic&rdquo; in Paul Zumthor&rsquo;s <b><i>Oral <strong>Poetry</strong></i></b>, 1990. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by E.

				"value": "Volume 5 gathers three versions of the Creation myth, in which the constant element is the bird that gathers the soil from which the land formations will grow. In the first version, the universe is a collaborative creation of several gods, although they defer to a Supreme Being. The earth&#x2019;s foundation is a giant iron pillar, but the sun and sky are placed too low until the Supreme Being&#x2019;s son-in-law raises it. Misery and death plague the human race after the Supreme Being allows the god of evil spirits to live as a human being on earth. Hence, the merciful Supreme Being sends down several spirit guardians, each with a specific function to help people survive in the various aspects of their lives. In the second version, the giant pillar is the earth&#x2019;s rotating center which is held fast to the sea. Plants are created first to provide medicine for the human race yet to be conceived. The first man and woman are created, but they eat the forbidden fruit and are punished with mortality. The human race multiplies quickly until the Supreme Being sends his ring to call them to an assembly so as to establish institutions of social order: the defining of land boundaries, the selection of leaders, and the duties of each individual to their community. The third version has the Creator sending his ring to call his secondary gods to an assembly, where he commands them to look after the earth. There is a flashback to the details of the creation process. Then the Supreme Being sends his <i>tubao</i> (headdress) to call for a second assembly, in which he assigns each deity to a specific function in keeping the universe in order. The myth ends with the chanter&#x2019;s song of praise for the Creator&#x2019;s power and artistry."

Published 2002. Transcriber and editor, Ernesto Constantino. Kyoto: Nakanishi Printing Co., Ltd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ullalim </i></b>is the epic of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, a mountain tribe in Luzon. The term <b>ullalim<i> </i></b>refers to the songs, sung by bards called <b>man-ullalim</b>,<b><i> </i></b>which deal with a hero&rsquo;s exploits, usually involving <i>kayaw</i>, head-hunting raids. Like most <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, the songs feature romance and magic and extol bravery. The singing of the epic is done at night during communal occasions, but private singing is also done to train the young to be future singers of the ullalim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several ullalim have been recorded. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5493\">E. Arsenio Manuel</a> cites a version recorded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5208\">Amador Daguio</a>; this, however, was lost in World War II. In 1970, Fr Francisco Billiet, CICM, and Fr Francis Lambrecht, CICM, published four ullalim in <b><i>Studies</i></b><i> <b>on Kalinga Ullalim and Ifugaw</b> <b>Orthography</b></i>.<i> </i>Their source for two of the four ullalim was a bard from Madukayong; they were assisted by Matilde Daluping. The two other ullalim had been recorded earlier. Fr Rafael Desmedt transcribed <b><i>Banna&rsquo;s Heroic</i></b> <b><i>Exploits </i></b>in 1943-44 as it was sung by a blind bard, Ballawig. A similar ullalim had been transcribed by Lucia Manopag, a teacher, on the initiative of Fr Leon Lindemans, as it was sung by Wagiwagan of Taloktok.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of the ullalim relate the adventures of Banna. In <b><i>The Magical</i></b><i> <b>Birth</b> <b>of</b></i> <b><i>Banna</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>recorded by<b><i> </i></b>Billiet and Lambrecht, Dulaw of Kagayan is betrothed to Ya-u. They follow a betel nut to a feast in Madogyaya, where Dulliyaw of Dulawon falls in love with Dulaw. He intoxicates Ya-u, and while Ya-u is sleeping, he makes Dulaw chew a slice of his betel nut. He informs her that she has just accepted his marriage proposal by sharing his nut, and he promises to come for her the following night. Dulliyaw does so, but a cock crow awakens the villagers. Dulliyaw leaves and kills a man. The villagers pursue him, but he eludes them by climbing a tree. Ya-u calls on the Spanish soldiers of Sakbawan to arrest Dulliyaw. The soldiers, headed by Guwela, capture Dulliyaw and Dulaw, and they imprison the two in Sakbawan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three years later, Dulliyaw gives Dulaw another slice of betel nut. But the slice vanishes and reappears in Magobya to Dinanaw, a maiden, after she has bathed in a river. She chews it and becomes pregnant. Three years later, she gives birth to Banna. The boy&rsquo;s friends tell him that he is the son of the prisoner Dulliyaw, but his mother denies it. Another three years pass; and Banna, now a young man, and his companions are transported to Sakbawan. Banna kills Dulaw, but his companion tells him that Dulliyaw is his father. Father and son return to Magobya riding a beam of light. Banna tells her mother that the man with him is his father. She accepts Dulliyaw&rsquo;s offer of betel nut, and they rejoice. The next day, the entire village of Magobya is transported to Dulawon where the villagers feast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two ullalim, both called <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Heroic</i></b><i> <b>Exploits</b> <b>of</b> <b>Banna</b></i>,<b><i> </i></b>relate how Banna obtains a wife for himself. In the Ballawig version, Banna falls in love with Laggunawa of Manggawa, a maiden betrothed to Dungdungan. When Banna arrives in Manggawa, Laggunawa welcomes him and, spreading a mat, teases him. Armed with a rifle, Dungdungan returns to Manggawa, having been warned by his father of Laggunawa&rsquo;s possible infidelity. Banna breaks Dungdungan&rsquo;s rifle. Dungdungan, in turn, breaks Banna&rsquo;s cap. Laggunawa steps in to break the fight. She sends each of the men to a kayaw. She will marry the better headhunter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Banna slaughters the inhabitants of Bibbila. Dungdungan rests, aware that being the legitimate fianc&eacute;, he will not lose his claim on Laggunawa whether or not Banna accomplishes his first task. When Banna returns, Dungdungan sends him to kill Uwon, a giant. Banna succeeds. His third task is to kill another giant, Gittam. Having accomplished this, he beheads Banna of Agunawa, a fearful warrior. Seeing that Banna has succeeded in all his exploits, Dungdungan runs away. Banna&rsquo;s and his men&rsquo;s shout of victory reaches Dulawon. Dulliyaw, Banna&rsquo;s father, calls for a feast, inviting the peoples of Manila, Isabela, and Sandangga. From a distance, however, the revellers hear Dungdungan&rsquo;s shouts. Dulliyaw predicts disorder. Later, the women find a spring dried up, another sign of impending disorder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Banna and his men meet Dungdungan and his followers in a creek. Dungdungan fires his rifle, burning Dulawon. Awingan, Banna&rsquo;s brother, bargains with Dungdungan. In exchange for the bride-price that Dungdungan&rsquo;s father has paid for Laggunawa, Dungdungan gets Banna&rsquo;s cap and gold. Further, Dinayaw, Banna&rsquo;s sister, is married to Dungdungan. Peace is restored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Taloktok version, Dungdungan&rsquo;s betrothed is called Dinayaw. Banna is assigned to kill Sindog of Gayyakayya, and Dungdungan is tasked to kill the giant Gittam. While Banna does his work, Dungdungan boasts of his exploits. He tells Banna to kill Gittam. When Banna returns, Dungdungan sends him to behead Kaluya of Ambanuya, a woman. Dungdungan hopes that Banna will not harm a woman. Dungdungan runs away when he realizes that Banna has accomplished even that. Banna marries Dinayaw, and Dungdungan is invited to the feast. Dungdungan is offered Bagital-yawon, Banna&rsquo;s sister, whom he readily accepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One ullalim, <b><i>Gonogonaw:</i></b><i> <b>A</b> <b>Nonheroic</b> <b>Day</b> <b>in</b> <b>Dulawon</b></i>,<i> </i>is curious for its lack of action. The word <i>gonogonaw </i>in the title refers to acceptance and the enjoyment of the status quo, even an idle or unadventurous one. Twice, the warriors of Dulawon are prevented from engaging in a kayaw. A deer&rsquo;s cry, auguring misfortune, stops them. They spend their time tattooing themselves instead. When they find the women newly bathed, they invite the women to a chew. The women, however, protest, because they are not to chew betel nut with men who are on the warpath. Instead, the men bathe themselves in the river. They return home happily with the women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Billiet and Lambrecht published two more ullalim in 1974 in <b><i>The</i></b> <b><i>Kalinga</i></b><i> <b>Ullalim</b> <b>II:</b> <b>Marriage</b> <b>between</b> <b>Enemies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Banna</b> <b>Who</b> <b>Becomes</b> <b>a Python</b></i>.<i> </i>The first was transcribed by Luica Manopag as it was sung by a female bard of Taloktok, who had learned it from her grandmother. It is about the unwitting reconciliation of two warring tribes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Separated from his companions after battling a giant, the hero Banna finds himself in Malunawa. There he sleeps until Onnawa, a maiden, arrives and, espying him, falls in love with him. Banna stirs from sleep, and he is speechless with love for Onnawa. But knowing that Onnawa is his father&rsquo;s enemy, Banna conceals his true identity and calls himself Banawa of Manila. He marries her in her village, Lukiban. Trouble begins when the father Pangdan arrives. He rejects Banna, believing that, since he hails from Manila, he must be poor. Although tempted to redeem himself, Banna refrains from revealing the truth. Pangdan sends him away, but Banna leaves Onnawa his cap and lime tube. Later, Onnawa gives birth to a son. Afraid that her father might harm him, she wraps it in a blanket and sends it afloat in a box with Banna&rsquo;s lime tube and cap and her own necklace. Mangonombaliyon of Baliwan discovers the infant and raises it as his own. He names the infant Gassingga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Banna is reunited with his family, but he is filled with thoughts of Onnawa. His mother, however, sends him to court Laggunawa of Magobya. He obeys her, but Suyyaba, Laggunawa&rsquo;s father, demands of his daughter&rsquo;s suitors the head of Liddawa of Kayyakayya, his enemy. Although the suitors kill Liddawa&rsquo;s relatives, they are not able to behead Liddawa himself. Only Banna&rsquo;s son Gassingga succeeds, and marries Laggunawa. The suitors, including Banna, protest that, by killing Liddawa&rsquo;s relatives, they have made it easy for Gassingga to behead Liddawa. To settle the imbroglio, Laggunawa sends each of them on a quest. Banna succeeds but Gassingga is swallowed by a python. Mangom-ombaliyon pleads that Banna save his son. Recognizing his cap in Mangom-ombaliyon&rsquo;s hands, Banna rescues Gassingga. The truth is finally revealed; father and son are reunited. Pangdan softens after Banna&rsquo;s father offers him gifts as restitution. The two enemies become friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Banna Becomes a Python</i></b> is shorter and more fantastic. After Laggunawa&rsquo;s love, Banna goes to cut bamboo in Gowa with his friends. His father warns him that the bamboo in Gowa are enchanted, but Banna does not listen. As he strikes a bamboo, it bleeds. Splattered by the blood, Banna slowly becomes a python. Although the villagers and Laggunawa accept him, Banna escapes one night. He slithers to Manila where he finds Dungdungan up a tree getting betel nuts. Banna says he wants to eat Dungdungan. The frightened man chews betel and spits at Banna. Banna becomes a man again. Accompanied by Dungdungan, he returns to the village and marries Laggunawa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Ullalim Banna</i></b>, transcribed by Ernesto Constantino, Banna&rsquo;s parents, Dalliyaw and Dinnanayan of Durawon, decide that it is time for him to marry, so they send him off to go courting. Banna finds the house of the maiden Laggunawa. When night falls, Banna enters her house through the roof. Laggunawa awakes and, after some hesitation, accepts his offer of betel nut, and they talk through the night. Laggunawa&rsquo;s father, Suyyaba, and his wife approve of Banna as a prospective son-in-law. But before they marry, Laggunawa asks him to kill the giant Kumaw. The daunting task causes Banna to weep. Stopping at the resting place called Guwa, he thinks of going home, but realizes that the men in his village will taunt him. He proceeds until he reaches a river, where the crocodiles let him walk on their backs up to Baungan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Banna comes upon Kumaw weaving. He is frightened of Kumaw but he orders his <i>aliwwa</i> (bolo) to kill the giant. He wraps Kumaw&rsquo;s severed head with the <i>sambaya </i>(blanket). The head continues to shout, so the people from Baungan and Kayyakayya give chase. Banna gets stuck in the middle of the lake in Killayan in Kayyakayya. Big men surround him but they cannot hit him, and the crocodiles fail to eat him. He spends three dry seasons in the lake eluding capture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Gallawi of Kabbasila is hunting at Ngawa in the resting place at Ngawangawa. He hears all the shouting in Kayyakayya and rescues Banna by commanding two crows to carry Banna to him. He sprays Banna with betel nut juice to wake Banna up. Banna mistakes Gallawi for Laggunawa and asks him to spray him some more. He is embarrassed when he discovers his error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gallawi takes Banna to his village of Kabbasila. Banna weeps, certain that the people are out to kill him to avenge their forefathers. Gallawi&rsquo;s wife serves Banna rice and basi (sugarcane wine), but Banna refuses to eat except with a maiden. He chooses Gassinu among the maidens and he mixes <i>amaya </i>(love charm) in the rice that they both eat. He asks Gassinu for the bolo,<i> </i>and with one blow, he fells some mango and coconut trees. Everyone approves Banna and Gassinu&rsquo;s marriage. Banna wants to take Gassinu home to Durawon but she refuses, saying it is too far away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After three years, Banna&rsquo;s father Dulliyaw learns that his son is in Kabbasila, and so he and his people go there. Stopping at Mar-unawa, they are met by Banna and the people of Kabbasila, who engage them in battle. Banna&rsquo;s cousins soon recognize him, and so Galliwa and the people of Kabbasila welcome these red-clad visitors from Durawon with food and gifts of precious jars. But when Gallawi prepares to take Banna and Gassinu home, Dulliyaw disagrees, explaining that Banna is his only child. Gallawi does not object as long as Banna stays with Gassinu, and reasons that there is also the advantage of being related to the rich people of Durawon. At the resting place at Guwa, Banna tells his father about Laggunawa and assures Gassinu that there is no cause for worry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the meantime, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2328\">Agta</a> tell Laggunawa of Banna&rsquo;s marriage to Gassinu. Laggunawa goes to Durawon to confront Banna and arrives while a feast is going on. Banna is nonplussed, but Gassinu exchanges harsh words with Laggunawa. Laggunawa asserts her right as the first wife, whereas Gassinu asserts her right to Banna&rsquo;s life, arguing that it was her father who saved him. Gassinu&rsquo;s son Baggasingga and Laggunawa&rsquo;s son Linnawa stop their mothers&rsquo; bickering. They suggest that they divide Banna between them, an idea that fuels Gassinu&rsquo;s anger even more. At dawn, she goes to Magobya and comes upon Laggunawa&rsquo;s grandchild alone in the house. She then goes straight home to Kabbasila. At sunset, the shout of death is heard. The Agta tell Laggunawa&rsquo;s son that Gassinu has killed Laggunawa&rsquo;s grandchild. Laggunawa, weeping, turns to her mother but the older woman admonishes her to keep her peace and vows that there will be no more bloodshed should anyone from Kabbasila ever come. Banna and Laggunawa live together as husband and wife. <em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua and Efmer Agustin</strong> </em><b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Billiet, Francisco, CICM, and Francis Lambrecht, CICM. 1970. <em>Studies on Kalinga Ullalim and Ifugaw Orthography</em>.

Laggunawa asserts her right as the first wife, whereas Gassinu asserts her right to Banna&#x2019;s life, arguing that it was her father who saved him. Gassinu&#x2019;s son Baggasingga and Laggunawa&#x2019;s son Linnawa stop their mothers&#x2019; bickering. They suggest that they divide Banna between them, an idea that fuels Gassinu&#x2019;s anger even more. At dawn, she goes to Magobya and comes upon Laggunawa&#x2019;s grandchild alone in the house.

Laggunawa, weeping, turns to her mother but the older woman admonishes her to keep her peace and vows that there will be no more bloodshed should anyone from Kabbasila ever come.

An astute observer of the social and political scene, Trinchera attacks the habit of kowtowing to important personages in &ldquo;An mga Is-Is&rdquo; (The Sycophants). Love of home, of one&rsquo;s country, or of a bucolic place was a favorite theme, as in de Veyra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Laylay sin Palun-on&rdquo; (Song of a Palo Native), and Makabenta&rsquo;s &ldquo;Busay ha Tulaan&rdquo; (Tulaan Waterfall). Lucente&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ha Pangpang han Daguitan&rdquo; (By the Banks of the Daguitan River) and Alvarado&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sa May&rsquo; Lalawtion&rdquo; (By Lalawiton) are meditations on the human condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rise of English in public life and the adoption of a national language might have contributed to the decline of interest in writing in Waray.

In both poems, the tuba speaks and advises its patrons how to drink without bringing trouble upon themselves and their community. Except for El O&rsquo;Mora&rsquo;s use of lowercase letters &agrave; la e. e. cummings in &ldquo;Paghingadtu han Bulan&rdquo; (Journey to the Moon), both poets retain the rhyme and meter, stanza form, and the tone and attitude of the poetry of the earlier period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The drama is represented by Romualdez&rsquo;s <b><i>An <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> han Manaranggot</i></b> (The Tuba Gatherer&rsquo;s Daughter), Iluminado Lucente&rsquo;s <b><i>Diri Daraga, Diri Balo, Diri Inasaw-an</i></b> (Not a Maiden, Not a Widow, Not a Wife), and El O&rsquo;Mora&rsquo;s <b><i>Leyte, Puro han Kasiyahanan</i></b><i> </i>(Leyte, Isle of Firsts).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Only writers from Leyte are presented in the book.

Except for El O&#x2019;Mora&#x2019;s use of lowercase letters &#xE0; la e. e. cummings in &#x201C;Paghingadtu han Bulan&#x201D; (Journey to the Moon), both poets retain the rhyme and meter, stanza form, and the tone and attitude of the poetry of the earlier period."

Seven other Mandaya epics have been identified, although these may also be taken as <b>hullobaton </b>(narratives), which are lengthy episodes of the larger <b>dawot</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a>). These seven dawot or hullobaton are <b><i>Sadya na Yalabo</i></b> (The Banishment of Sadya), <b><i>Yangagaw si Dilam</i></b> (Dilam Takes Tibay&rsquo;s Betrothed by Force), <b><i>Syukli si Obang</i></b> (The Abduction of Obang), <b><i>Pyalid si Sadya</i></b> (Dilam Uses Storm to Abduct Sadya), <b><i>Maylan</i></b> (Maylan&rsquo;s Death and Resurrection), <b><i>Yubolla si Daymon</i></b> (Daymon Goes to War), and <b><i>Gambong</i></b> (Gambong and His Ornamental Tree).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Yang Mangngagaw</i></b> (The Taking by Force) is a Mandaya dawot that is sung by <b>magdadawot</b> (epic singers) in Caraga, Davao Oriental. It consists of 2,020 lines and can be divided into 10 episodes, based on its story line and scene changes. One of the epic conventions immediately obvious in this piece is the use of many names for one character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first episode introduces the epic hero and the epic problem. The hero is Maynabong nal Layag (The Handsome One), aka Sabong of Kadigi, aka Kyabadbaran (The South). The epic problem is Sabong&rsquo;s desire for Sadya of Ullaynun, aka Bullawanun (The Golden Place). The epic opens with Sabong in his home at Kadigi sewing his red clothes, which he embroiders with orange and yellow stitches. Its misbehavior frustrates him and so he hacks it into shreds with his bolo. Asked by his brothers Lanus and Luntad what troubles him, Sabong tells them that he desires Inung Masadyang Kilat, aka Sadya, the sister of Dyuyan in Ullaynun. But Sadya is already betrothed to Ombang, brother of Tibay, from Byadbadan. Sabong and his brothers summon their sister Malimbungon na Panday (Beautiful Wise Maiden), aka Linimbong, from her room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Ullaynun, Sadya, and her two sisters, Omal-lag sa Maglimbay and Magallowaing Samtan, are getting dressed to go outside and walk toward their <i>digpi</i> (room), which is forbidden to everyone else. Many obstacles along the way discourage trespassers. The door creaks when it is opened, thus alerting Al-lag the <i>diwata</i> (spirit guardian) who bars Sadya at the door should she attempt to leave the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The scene shifts back to Kadigi, where Linimbong is helping her brother Sabong look his best as he prepares for the journey to Byadbaran to court Sadya. His hair, which reaches down to the floor is &ldquo;as thick as bamboo&rdquo; so that only a flute can comb it. She applies oil to his hair and combs it into seven braids. When he tells her that he has decided to take for his wife a woman already betrothed, she advises him to cover his fingers with many rings, put a necklace on, and wear jewelled anklets. From among his many red garments in the golden chest, she chooses a vest and a golden belt for him to wear. He takes his spear and shield and his brothers follow suit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lanus and Luntad, dressed in their best finery, follow their brother Sabong toward the boat. They walk past the women&rsquo;s garden of betel trees and flowers. Sabong rows and steers the boat through eight rivers dangerously filled with whirlpools and rocks. But when they reach Ullaynun, the water is very calm and deep, the sand sparkles, and the rocks are as numerous as ants. Red garments, bolos, shields, flowers, yellow strands from the dye tree are floating on the water. Trees as many as the strands of a head of hair fill the air with the scent of their flowers. So numerous are the flowers they can be picked from across the shore of Ullaynun and made into belts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">They walk past the women&rsquo;s abaca farm and grove of betel nut trees, through eight rivers filled with flowers, over sequined fences, past the dye tree tied with jewels and plants to secure them against storms. Sabong picks a flower from Sadya&rsquo;s garden and vows that she is the only flower that he will ever pick even if he were to crawl under her house. A noisy gathering in the house where Sadya lives is in progress; her brothers are hosting her prospective brothers- and sisters-in-law from Byadbadan. Ombang&rsquo;s eldest brother, Tibay, and Sadya&rsquo;s eldest brother, Dagyo, are conversing loudly; jars and glasses break; drunken people come and go with their braids undone. Dagyo&rsquo;s slave notices the brothers from Kadigi standing in the yard but when she warns Dagyo, he likens her to the <i>limukon</i><b> </b>(omen bird), which gives false warnings. The brothers from Kadigi are treated with the utmost courtesy, with inquiries about their journey and offers of betel chew. Each brother is invited to sit beside a host brother who is most like him: Lanus sits beside Dyuyan; Sabong, after some hesitation, sits beside Dallmun; and Luntad is honored with a spot in Dagyo&rsquo;s room. Asked how far they have come, Luntad replies that the &ldquo;distance is between two guitar strings.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The gestures of hospitality continue. Sadya and her three sisters are summoned from their room to welcome the guests. Then they go back to their room for betel chew despite much difficulty because of the obstacles along the way. Dagyo goes down to fetch a jar of wine. Returning, he throws the jar at the wall, and Dyuyan catches it but its contents spill out. Dagyo fetches another jar and offers wine to his own sisters, who refuse. Dagyo drinks wine with the brothers from Kadigi. He then asks for more wine, this time for his other set of guests, the sisters of Tibay and Ombang from Byadbadan. But it is Luntad who offers the wine, first, to the eldest sister, Ballobaynun nam Bullan. When she refuses, her younger sister, Salingkugon sa Baybay, takes it and drinks. Luntad pleads with Ballobaynun nam Bullan to drink the wine, claiming to prefer death to despair should she refuse. And so she accepts the wine. At first Salingkugon sa Baybay goes to Makaway, brother of Dagyo, but offers the wine instead to Luntad. He takes hold of her hand; and her necklace, heavy with pure gold, falls as his hands begin to move.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manggob, aka Dyumabok Manginsawan, brother of Tibay and Ombang, fetches Sadya from her room. Her spirit-guard, Omal-lag sa Maglimbay, does not stand in her way. But first, Sadya oils her hair and combs it; she shaves her brows with a sharp knife, places 65 to a hundred rings on her fingers, takes a necklace and winds it around her neck seven or eight times. She is reminded to keep the honor of Ullaynun unstained because it is what she will take with her to Byadbadan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dyumabok Manginsawan, aka Manggob, brother of Tibay and Ombang, has been guarding the door of Sadya&rsquo;s room in case she tries to escape. Now he holds her by the shoulder as she emerges. The first item that she asks for her dowry is a wash basin for her lady companion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Makailaw sa Baybay (Light of the Shore), aka Ilaw sang Kasiglluman (Light in the Dark), another sister of Tibay and Ombang, is yet unaware that Sadya has been called out of her room by her brother Dyuyan. It is Dyuyan who is tasked with determining the bride-price, or dowry, of his sister Sadya. Ombang, the <i>bagani</i> (warrior) to whom she is betrothed, gives Dyuyan seven necklaces. Sadya is about to leave her room when Ballobaynun nam Bullan, Ombang&rsquo;s sister, has a premonition and holds her back. She fears that Sadya might stumble and fall, and that is a bad omen. Dallmun, aka Mallapog, Sadya and Dagyo&rsquo;s brother, is impervious to all this; he enters Sadya&rsquo;s room, lies on the red mat, and falls fast asleep. Sadya now emerges from her room, mindful of the danger of stumbling. The first obstacle she encounters is the jar of wine blocking her door. She rues her difficulties and wishes she could simply break the jar, but that would be a bad omen. Manggob, Ombang&rsquo;s brother, drinks all the wine in the jar and breaks it. His sisters become angry with him because this will raise Sadya&rsquo;s bride-price. Sadya now asks for the necklace of Makailaw sa Baybay, Ombang&rsquo;s sister, who pleads with her not to take it. But Makailaw&rsquo;s brother promises Sadya the necklace she desires. The dowry now fully given, Sadya emerges and sits on the red mat. Ballobaynun pleads with her brother to prevent Sadya from facing west, because that is a bad omen. She notices with foreboding that her brother Ombang is reluctant to sit and talk with Sadya. Ballobaynun compares herself to the limokon whose prophecies must be heeded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Sabong is hatching up a plan to win Sadya for himself. He will ask her whether she prefers the tree standing toward the west and blooming with bolos or the tree fully adorned and topped by a flower. He will tell her about his boat, which is shaped like a crocodile or dragon and its interior filled with carvings. The men of both Byadbadan and Ullaynun are distracted by a crowd of warriors who have docked, ready to do battle. The house trembles. Sabong grabs his chance; he embraces, kisses, and caresses Sadya. She struggles and screams so loudly her brother fears that it might summon their dead parents. Sabong moves to escape, and Tibay&rsquo;s sisters scramble out of his way. Ombong vows that he will marry Sadya anyway. Nevertheless, now brought to shame, Sadya continues to wail loudly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tibay and Sabong engage in a battle of spears and angry words until the house pleads with them to take their fight outside. Lanus calls to his brother Luntad for them to help their brother Sabong. But Luntad, now smitten with Tibay&rsquo;s sister, Salingkugon sa Baybay, takes her hand, and the pair stand in the middle of the fight. An outraged Tibay pulls her away and the fight continues interminably. Finally, Tibay goes to his sister Aybay and bids her sit beside Ubang ng Pagkallayon of Kadigi. Reproached by Aybay for his involvement in the fight, Ubang lays the blame on both his brother Sabong and her brother Tibay. Ubang takes Aybay into the middle of the fight, and the brothers from Kadigi stop fighting at the sight of her beauty. Tibay decides it is time to discuss a truce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Sabang, Maglipig Mal-langitnin, aka Lipig, the diwata of peace, is awakened by his sister Biya Domallaiyak. She urges him to go down to earth and stop the fight by revealing to the warriors that they are all brothers from Ullaynun. On earth many spears whiz by Lipig and they break as he steps on them. The destruction of the garden and the sight of flowers strewn on the ground sadden him. He separates the ocean from the sea, thus causing the waves to crash against the rocks. Seeing the impending flood, Tibay calls a halt to the war. Lanus hesitates, wondering at the sincerity of the call. Lipig identifies himself as Lanus&rsquo;s brother; they come from the same father, Dyabongan. Their father had him thrown into the sea because of his ugliness and he was washed up in the place of the gods. He admonishes all the brothers to share betel chew and let peace reign. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",
