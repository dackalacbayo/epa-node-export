In 1976, he co-founded the UP Film Center (now the UP Film Institute Film Center) where he served as assistant director until 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aguiluz&rsquo;s first film was a 15-minute documentary titled <b><i>Mt.

Starring Sarsi Emmanuelle, one of the hottest bold stars at the time, <b><i>Boatman</i></b> was both a commercial and critical success. Its bleak yet realistic depiction of poverty and the lives of live sex performers set the film apart from the soft-porn films being made at the time. Aguiluz&rsquo;s next project was co-directing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\">Viva Films</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<b><i>Balweg: The Rebel Priest</i></b>, 1986, the true-to-life story of Fr Conrado Balweg, the Catholic priest-turned-revolutionary leader who founded the Cordillera People&rsquo;s Liberation Army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took almost a decade before Aguiluz made his next film, the docudrama <b><i>Bagong <strong>Bayani</strong> </i></b>(<b><i>Unsung Heroine</i></b>), 1995. <b><i>Bagong Bayani </i></b>explores the real events surrounding the execution of Flor Contemplacion, the Filipino domestic worker in Singapore who was sentenced to death for killing her fellow domestic worker, Delia Maga, and the four-year-old son of Maga&rsquo;s employer.

The film won the Best Director award for Aguiluz in the 1997Gawad Urian, as well as Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Supporting Actor (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4538\">Albert Martinez</a>).

Produced on a shoestring budget, the film tells the story of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"> Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s life while in exile in Dapitan. <b><i><strong>Rizal sa Dapitan</strong> </i></b>swept the major awards at the 1997 Metro Manila Film Festival, 1998 Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Awards, and 1998 Star Awards for Movies. When it competed in the Festival International du Film Independent in Brussels, it won the Grand Jury Prize in addition to the Best Actor award for lead star Albert Martinez who played Rizal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 1998 and 2003, Aguiluz made four feature films: <b><i><strong>Tatsulok</strong> </i></b>(Triangle), 1998, <b><i>Biyaheng Langit</i></b> (Paradise Express<i>)</i>, 2000, <b><i>Tatarin </i></b>(St John&rsquo;s Day Ritual), 2001, and <b><i>www.XXX.com</i></b>, 2003.

Aguiluz later claimed that the producers shot additional scenes and re-edited the film without his knowledge, prompting him to ask lead star and producer Jeorge &ldquo;ER&rdquo; Ejercito to remove his name in the film&rsquo;s credits. In 2015, he made <b><i>Tragic Theater</i></b>, an adaptation of GM Coronel&rsquo;s book about the ghost haunting the abandoned Manila Film Center.

ACPI holds the four core values of excellence, innovation, entrepreneurship, and integrity. As of 2014, Rowena Bagadion of Media Farm Inc represents the council as its president. Other officers are Nestor Palabrica of TOIE Animation Philippines Inc as vice president and Ricky Orellana of Mowelfund Film Institute as secretary. With its partnership with several animation stakeholder industries&mdash;for example, Tuldok<i> </i>(Dot), Cadweb, Unang Kompanya<i> </i>(First Company)&mdash;and learning institutions such as De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde, ACPI visualizes the progress of animation in the country through business and education. It aims to nurture potential animators, both in 2D and 3D platforms, and the Filipino passion for animation as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ACPI promotes a globally competitive animation industry in the Philippines. It aims to carve more Filipino talents in creative and technological animation, in both the local and the international animation scenes. With several projects in line, it aims to bring the Philippines to the list of countries as prime providers of animation and content creation services. Other services of ACPI are preproduction (including, but not limited to, storyboard, sound editing, and concept art), production (including, but not limited to, cleanup/in-betweening, line stating, digital animation services, architectural visualization, and audiovisual presentations), and postproduction (including, but not limited to, musical scoring, sound effects and design, and special effects) services in Philippine 2D/3D animation, deployment of instructors or experts to animation workshops, and web/graphic/art designs for different platforms such as mobile applications, interactive games, and e-Learning modules. It provides training programs across the country, catering to beginners interested in animation as well as to advanced trainers and professional animators. Some of the training programs are curriculum development and consultancy for 2D/3D animation, technical advising for software and hardware requirements, and project/production management in 2D/3D/Flash animation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Animahenasyon </i></b>(a combination of Filipino terms for animation and imagination), ACPI&rsquo;s flagship project, is an annual Filipino animation festival and competition. It serves a place for the diverse sets of participants (aspiring and professional animators) to show their potentials, ideas, and original works. Animahenasyon<b><i> </i></b>also includes seminars, workshops, congresses, classes, and exhibits featuring works of seasoned animators and lifetime achievement awardees. Moreover, it is a venue for the aspiring and amateur animators to meet the experts and renowned names in the industry.

		"text": "<p><strong>Apeng Daldal</strong> <b> </b>(<b>Serafin Maniego Gabriel</b>) was a stage, film and television actor, comedian, singer, dancer, and scriptwriter. He was born in San Luis, Pampanga on 12 Oct&nbsp;1928. He died on 9 Feb&nbsp;1992. He was the son of Moises Gabriel and Mauricia Maniego. He was married to Elma Modesto with whom he had eight children. It is believed that his moniker was based on his set of big teeth (<i>apen</i> in his native Kapampangan) and his being a fast talker (<i>daldal</i>), although the nickname Apeng is also a diminutive of the first name Serafin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apeng Daldal began his career dancing in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><i>bodabil</i></a> in his Tondo, Manila neighborhood, where he was a favorite dancing partner of cross-dressers. In the late 1940s to 1950s, his performances in comedy skits at the Manila Opera House with Mar Lopez and Bebing Santos, who formed the trio Top Three, were a crowd drawer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, actor Johnny Wilson discovered him for television and put him in <b><i>The Big Show</i></b> with Cris de Vera, later becoming a mainstay in the sitcoms <b><i>Tindahan sa Nayon </i></b>(Village Store) and <b><i>Trio los Bobos </i></b>(The Three Idiots) in the 1970s and <b><i>Cafeteria Aroma </i></b>and <b><i>Super Laff-In</i></b> in the 1980s. At the same time, Apeng Daldal began to make movies, mostly in supporting roles. In 1964, he appeared with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\">Susan Roces</a><strong> </strong> in <b><i>Libis ng Baryo</i></b> (Barrio Edge). His major movie roles were in <b><i>Magic Bilao </i></b>(Magic Winnowing Basket) and <b><i>Walis ni Tenteng </i></b>(Tenteng&rsquo;s Broom), both in 1965. His first starring role was in <b><i>Maskulado </i></b>(Muscular), also in 1965.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apeng wrote scripts for several TV shows in the 1970s, including <b><i>Ayos Lang, Pare Ko </i></b>(It&rsquo;s Okay, My Friend) and <b><i>The Nida-Lita Show </i></b>on Channel 9, and <b><i>Barok-an Subdivision </i></b>on Channel 13. He was also on radio in the afternoon and evening timeslots. He wrote several songs, the most well-known of which were <b><i>Hoy, <strong>Mama</strong> ng Kaminero </i></b>(Hey, Mr Street Sweeper) and <b><i><strong> <strong>Pandanggo</strong> </strong> ng Aswang </i></b>(Fandango of the Viscera Sucker), both released in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though lacking in recognition from award-giving bodies, Apeng Daldal won praise from critics for his dramatic role in an episode of the TV drama series <b><i>Eliza</i></b>, 1970-72, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a><strong><strong> </strong> </strong> (Channel 9), deviating from his comic stereotype.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the movies Apeng Daldal appeared in were from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a>, including <b><i>Alias Golden Boy</i></b>, 1963; <b><i>Babaing Kidlat</i></b> (Lightning Woman), <b><i>Mga Daliring Ginto</i></b> (Golden Fingers), <b><i>Show Business</i></b>, <b><i>Bandong Pugante</i></b> (Bando the Escapee), and <b><i>Simbangis ng Tigre</i></b> (Ferocious as a Tiger), 1964; <b><i>Tatlong Mabilis</i></b> (The Three Fast Ones), <b><i>Magic Bilao</i></b> (Magic Winnowing Basket), <b><i>Maskulado</i></b> (Muscular), <b><i>Tatlong Mabilis sa Hong Kong</i></b> (The Three Fast Ones in Hong Kong), and <b><i>Walis ni Tenteng</i></b> (Tenteng&rsquo;s Broom), 1965; <b><i>Mistico Meets Mamaw</i></b> and <b><i>Pitong James Bonds </i></b>(Seven James Bonds), 1966; <b><i>The Son of Dyango Meets Dorango Kid</i></b>, <b><i>Langit Pa Rin Kita</i></b> (You&rsquo;re Still My Heaven), and <b><i>The Pogi Dozen</i></b> (The Handsome Dozen), 1967; <b><i>Yolindina</i></b>, <b><i>Concentration Camp No. 5</i></b>, and <b><i>Ang Inyong Lingkod, <strong><strong> <strong>Matutina</strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> (At Your Service, Matutina), 1975; <b><i>Habang Pinipigil, Lalong Nanggigigil</i></b> (The More You Try to Control, the More the Desire Gets Stronger), and <b><i>Wow, Sikat!

She was born in Concepcion, Tarlac on 28 May 1934. She is one of the children of Aurora Lampa and Benigno Quiambao Aquino Sr, a former congressman, 1919-25, senator, 1928, secretary of agriculture under Commonwealth president Manuel L. Quezon, 1937, and Speaker of the National Assembly of the Second Philippine Republic, 1943-45. Her siblings are Maria Aurora Aquino-Lichauco, former senator Benigno Simeon Jr aka Ninoy, Maria Gerarda, Paul, former senator Agapito aka Butz, and former senator Maria Teresa Aquino-Oreta aka Tessie. Her brother Butz was a film and television actor. She is the aunt of TV host Kris Aquino and former president Benigno &ldquo;Noynoy&rdquo; Aquino III. She married her first husband Cesar Rafael Concio Jr in 1961, with whom she has six children, one of whom is Mia Concio, a screenwriter and former chair of the government station National Broadcasting Network Channel 4, formerly People&rsquo;s Television. Concio Jr was a recipient of the Ten Outstanding Young Men in the field of technology in 1966. After their separation and divorce, she married Emmy Award-winning Japanese journalist Ken Kashiwahara, who was then working as ABC&rsquo;s San Francisco bureau chief, in the early 1980s. She took up liberal arts, major in social studies and minor in journalism, at Maryknoll College (now Miriam College). She obtained a master of arts in communication, major in television, from the American University in Washington, DC, in the late 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When she returned to the Philippines, she directed TV programs on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>, beginning in the early 1960s, such as the children&rsquo;s program <b><i>Magnolia Sunday Party</i></b>; the instructional show <b><i>Education on TV</i></b>; the live 30-minute drama program <b><i>Family Theater</i></b> by Fr James Reuter, SJ, which usually featured adaptations of American plays; and <b><i>Northern Motors&rsquo; Filipinesques</i></b>, a music program that featured a 24-piece orchestra playing Filipino compositions.

		"text": "<p><strong>Jorge O. Arago&nbsp;</strong>was a screenwriter and journalist. He was born on 12 Jan&nbsp;1943. He died on 27 Dec 2011. He earned his degrees in journalism, comparative literature, and geology at the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman. Having a civil service license as an information writer and as a cultural attach&eacute;, he used this as a qualification to write and direct a film documentary on People&rsquo;s Republic of China and to cover presidential state visits to Russia and Cuba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arago was a freshman in UP when he met <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>. Eventually, he wrote the screenplays for Bernal&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1252\"><strong>Nunal sa Tubig</strong></a></i></b> (Speck in the Water), 1976, and <b><i>Sugat sa Ugat</i></b> (Wound in the Roots), 1983. He also served as a script consultant for Bernal&rsquo;s <b><i>City after Dark</i></b> (or <b><i>Manila by Night</i></b>), 1980. In 2005, Arago was a co-writer to director Briccio Santos for the independent film <b><i>A la Verde, A la Pobre</i></b><i> </i>(Green, Poor), 2005. Two years later, they co-wrote another independent film titled <b><i>A la Suerte, A la Muerte</i></b><i> </i>(Luck, Death), 2007.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arago was nominated in the 1977 Gawad Urian for his screenplay for <b><i>Nunal sa Tubig</i></b>. In 2005, he won with Santos the Gawad Urian Best Screenplay for <b><i>A la Verde, A la Pobre</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arago&rsquo;s last known project was supposed to have been a biopic on Bernal&rsquo;s life, which would have included a 60-minute video portrait, an anthology of film reviews, the full text of his six screenplays, annotated working scripts, and interviews with Bernal&rsquo;s former co-workers and associates. Unfortunately, such project was never finished. <em><strong>Written by Gregory del Carmen</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

		"text": "<p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\"><b>Dely Atay-Atayan&nbsp;</b>(<b>Adelaida Marquez Fernando-Cruz</b>) was a radio, television, and stage actor, and a singer. She was born in Tayabas, Tondo, Manila on 17 Mar&nbsp;1914. She died in Para&ntilde;aque on 30 Aug&nbsp;2004. She studied at Rizal Elementary School, Torres High School, and Philippine Normal School up to the second year. Her father Amado Fernando was a painter and composer, mother Carmen Marquez, a singer, and brother Fernando aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4831\">Ading Fernando</a> was an actor, scriptwriter, and director. When first spouse Alejandro Villegas, aka Andoy Balunbalunan, died, she married Catalino Cruz, aka Jockey Tenoy. Her only child with Villegas, Alfonso, is a dancer, while Alfonso&rsquo;s three daughters, Ann, Armi, and Aida, are actors. Her great-grandson, Manuel Villegas Quizon II, also the grandson of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, is an actor and singer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\">Atay-atayan was 15 when she first joined amateur singing contests in Binondo, where her family lived. She then landed a stint as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><i>kundiman</i></a> singer at the Palace Theater, touring the country as a member of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><i>bodabil</i></a> troupe from 1930 to 1934. It was also during this period when she began to sing on KZIB with her brother Ading. She also performed at the Clover Theater with comedians Dolphy, Aruray, the duo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, Casmot, Balot, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4254\">Panchito</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a>. When she married Villegas in 1934, they became partners in Radio Variety Revue Company performing on stage and on the air. Radio programming manager G. S. Fernandez gave her the moniker Dely Atay-atayan while Matty Torres gave her husband the nickname Andoy Balunbalunan. Their nicknames (<i>atay</i> is Tagalog for liver while <i>balunbalunan</i> is chicken gizzard) led to their theme song &ldquo;Awit ng Manok&rdquo; (Song of the Chicken). Producing the most popular blocktime programs, the couple was the biggest earner among prewar radio blocktimers, making over one thousand pesos a month, a fabulous sum when top-level government employees earned 30 to 35 pesos a month. Some of their songs, interspersed with comic routines, were critical of the colonial condition at the time, such as &ldquo;Alila&rdquo; (Slave). Moreover, the husband-and-wife team sang radio commercials, the most popular being <b><i>Kiko Baterya</i></b> (Kiko Battery) and <b><i>Alviz Tailoring</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\">She was tagged as &ldquo;queen of laughs,&rdquo; &ldquo;sweetheart of the airlanes,&rdquo; and Gracie Allen of the Philippines (referencing the American comedienne, half of the <b><i>George Burns and Gracie Allen Show</i></b>). She was outstanding in such radio shows as <b><i>Tang-tarang-tang</i></b> (Daddy-O), <b><i>Gabi ng Shell </i></b>(Night of Shell Company), and <b><i>Ay, Neneng</i></b> (Oh, Neneng). She formed a quartet called the Ancient Fox with Pugak, Lopito, and Doro de los Ojos. Even during the war, she continued performing comedy at the Life Theater and at the Manila Grand Opera House under the direction of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\">Her first movie was <b><i>Lakambini</i></b> (Muse), 1940, opposite Balunbalunan. She made some five dozen films, including the popular movies of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere Productions</a>, like <b><i>Bulaklak</i></b> <b><i>at Paru-Paro</i></b> (Flower and Butterfly) and <b><i>Kumander Sundang</i></b> (Commander Dagger), 1948; <b><i>Padre Burgos</i></b> (Father Burgos), 1949; <b><i>Kenkoy</i></b> (Comic), 1950; <b><i>Mr. and Mrs.</i></b>, 1956; <b><i>Pitong Gatang</i></b> (Seven Gantas), 1959; <b><i>Nobody&rsquo;s Child</i></b>, 1970; <b><i>Mahiwagang Kris</i></b> (The Fantastic Kris), 1975; and <b><i>Buhay Misis</i></b> (Life of a Housewife), 1983. Her other films include <b><i>I Won, I Won: Ang Swerte Nga Naman</i></b> (I Won, I Won: How Lucky of Me), 1985; <b><i>Si Baleleng at ang Gintong Sirena</i></b> (Baleleng and the Golden Mermaid), 1988; <b><i>Everlasting Love</i></b>, 1989; and <b><i>Chickboys</i></b>, 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\">From the 1970s to the 1980s, she concentrated on TV, appearing as the moralizing mother-in-law in the long-running comedy series <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\">John en Marsha</a> </i></b>(John and Marsha),<b><i> </i></b>1973-1990, with Dolphy and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\">Nida Blanca</a>. Written and directed by her brother Ading, <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, one of the longest running television sitcoms, was the program for which she is best remembered. She reprised her TV role in several movie spinoffs of the series from 1974 to 1991. Atay-Atayan also appeared in another popular television show, <b><i>Iskul Bukol </i></b>(Truants),<b> </b>from 1977 to 1990, starring the comedy trio of Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon. Like <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, this series also spawned movie adaptations and remakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0cm 0cm 10pt\">Atay-Atayan received the Pambansang Akademya ng Telebisyon sa Agham at Sining (PATAS) Award as Outstanding Actor, 1977, and Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, 1978. She also received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences</a> (FAMAS) at the age of 81 during ceremonies held at the Philippine International Convention Center in 1993. In 2001, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines</a> honored Atay-atayan with another Lifetime Achievement Award. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Malou L.

		"text": "<p><strong>Nora Aunor </strong> (<strong>Nora Cabaltera Villamayor</strong>), also known as Guy, is a film, television, and theater actor, a singer, and a film producer. She was born in Iriga, Camarines Sur on 21 May 1953. Her parents are Antonia Cabaltera and Eustaquio Villamayor. She was married to actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4385\">Christopher de Leon</a>, with whom she has one child, actor Ian de Leon, and two adopted daughters, actors Lotlot de Leon and Matet de Leon. Lotlot was married to actor Ramon Christopher, son of actors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4467\">Eddie Gutierrez</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\">Pilita Corrales</a>. Actor Eddie Villamayor is her brother. Aunor has two other adopted children, Kiko and Kenneth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aunor began her career doing the rounds of amateur singing contests. Under the tutelage of her aunt Belen and uncle Saturnino Aunor, who took her under their custody and from whom she got her screen name, she emerged champion in the nationwide TV show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Call of the Stage) in 1967.<i> </i>Her successful stint in <b><i>Tawag</i></b>,<i> </i>as well as in <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b>,<i> </i>led to her phenomenal rise as a major star of the Philippine movie industry, which accorded her the title &ldquo;Superstar.&rdquo; Dr Jose R. Perez of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\"> Sampaguita Pictures<strong><strong> </strong> </strong></a>signed her up for a contract and initially cast her in bit roles in films like <b><i>All Over the World</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Cinderella A-Go-Go</i></b>,<i> </i>1967; <b><i>Dobol Wedding</i></b><i> </i>(Double Wedding),<b> </b>1968; <b><i>YeYe Generation! </i></b>and<b> <i>9 Teeners</i></b>,<i> </i>1969. Two other companies launched Aunor as a lead star in movies released simultaneously in Sep 1969: Tower Productions&rsquo;<i> <b>D&rsquo; <strong>Musical</strong> Teenage Idols</b></i> and JBC Productions&rsquo; <b><i>Fiesta Extravaganza</i></b>. Her subsequent appearances in the films of Tower, like <b><i>Teenage Escapades</i></b>,<i> </i>1969, and <b><i>Teenage Jamboree</i></b>, 1970,<i> </i>led to a lawsuit filed by Sampaguita Pictures Inc (SPI) and its sister company, VP Pictures (VP), for breach of contract. The case dragged on for years while Aunor made films with the two litigants, transferring from Tower to SPI-VP long before the lawsuit was resolved. Among her films for Tower are <b><i>Tell Nora I Love Her</i></b>, <b><i>Three for the Road</i></b>, <b><i>Darling</i></b>,<i> <b>Nora in Wonderland</b></i>, <b><i>Tomboy Nora</i></b>,<i> </i>and<b> <i>Around Asia with Nora</i></b>, all in 1970, while for SPI-VP she made <b><i>Young Love</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Nasaan Ka, Inay?</i></b><i> </i>(Where Are You, Mother?), 1970; <b><i>Guy and Pip </i></b>and <b><i>My Blue Hawaii</i></b>,<i> </i>1971; <b><i>A Gift of Love</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Winter Holiday</i></b>, 1972, among others. The case was finally decided in favor of SPI-VP in 1974. Meanwhile, Aunor had turned movie producer, naming her company NV (Nora Villamayor) Productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the help of Dr Perez, who loaned her his studio and film equipment, NV released its initial film in 1973, <b><i>Carmela</i></b>,<i> </i>a horror movie. Aunor produced films with commercial appeal&mdash;like <b><i>Super Gee</i></b>, 1973, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4972\">Nestor U.

Her first drama script for television, <b><i>Daga sa Timba ng Tubig</i></b> (Rat in a Bucket of Water), 1970s, directed by Lino Brocka, was banned by the Board of Censors because of its theme about the miscarriage of justice. Her teleplay for &ldquo;Isang Kabanata sa Buhay ni Leilani Cruzaldo&rdquo; (A Chapter in Leilani Cruzaldo&rsquo;s Life) was the pilot episode of the drama anthology <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1411\">Balintataw</a> </i></b>(The Mind&rsquo;s Eye), revived in 1987, and won for the series the Best Drama Anthology award at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4781\">Catholic Mass Media Awards</a>&nbsp;that same year.

He is a National Artist for film. He was born in Pilar, Sorsogon on 7 Apr&nbsp;1939. He died in Quezon City on 22 May 1991. He was the son of Regino Brocka of Sorsogon and Pilar Ortiz of San Jose, Nueva Ecija. When his father died, Brocka&rsquo;s family moved to his mother&rsquo;s birthplace. He studied at Nueva Ecija North High School. He would hold poetry sessions in the evening with the dining table as his stage. He was the best student orator in the province. He organized and headed a community theater group, which gave performances and workshops in the barrios. During his college days at the University of the Philippines (UP) in Diliman, while pursuing a bachelor of arts degree in English literature, he was active with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3335\"> UP Dramatic Club</a>. He could not get any roles because of his provincial accent and lack of height, so he volunteered to do stage management and lighting design to stay in theater. After UP, he became a Mormon missionary for two years and spent some time in Molokai, the Hawaii leper colony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon his return to the Philippines, he joined the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>. He played minor roles in PETA plays and did odd jobs, writing press releases, working as a stage hand, assistant director, and later as director.

		"text": "<p><strong>Cachupoy</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Salvador Garcia Tampac</strong>) was a film, stage, and television actor, comedian, and singer. He was born in Sampaloc, Manila on 12 Jul&nbsp;1932. He died in Manila on 7 Dec&nbsp;1993. He was the son of&nbsp;Segundina Garcia and Meliton Tampac. He had five children. He studied at Juan Luna Elementary School, Roxas High School, and the University of Santo Tomas, where he finished two years of fine arts. He worked with a construction firm before going into show business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The late veteran showman <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a>, who was also known as Chipopoy, gave him the name Cachupoy when they appeared together at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a> stage shows. Cachupoy became a comedian by accident. He was a guitarist and singer under Dalton de Castro when he was forced to take the place of an absent comedian. Reluctant to do so, he was pushed to the center of the stage and stumbled, provoking laughter from the audience who thought it was part of the act. Soon, he became a regular at the Manila Grand Opera House and was sought after by other entertainment groups. He also sang as a member of &ldquo;The Millionaires,&rdquo; with Manok and Miniong Villegas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972, he appeared opposite Djohanna Garcia in Luis Nepomuceno Productions&rsquo;s&nbsp;<b><i><strong>Ang Larawan</strong> ni Melissa</i></b><i> </i>(Melissa&rsquo;s Portrait). He also appeared in the movies <b><i><strong>Igorot</strong>a</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Mountain Maiden</i></b>), 1968; <b><i>Mong</i></b>,<i> </i>1979; <b><i>Andres de Saya</i></b><i> </i>(Andres the Henpecked Husband), 1980; <b><i>Boni en Klayd </i></b>(Boni and Klayd), 1981; <b><i>Sinisinta</i></b><i> <b>Kita</b> </i>(You Are My Love), 1981; <b><i>Tsaplin en da 3 Istudyes</i></b><i> </i>(Chaplin and the 3 Stooges), 1982; and <b><i>Wrong Ranger</i></b>,<i> </i>1984. In most of his films, he portrays the Sad Sack; his long, forlorn face, with hair parted in the middle and falling down straight, is what distinguishes him from other comedians. He worked with actors such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4757\">Apeng Daldal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4294\">Bentot</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4546\">Eddie Mesa</a>, Daisy Romualdez, Ruby Regala, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4552\">Mario Montenegro</a>, and Lucita Soriano. His colleagues aver that Cachupoy is a small man with a big heart who goes around giving free charity shows in hospitals, orphanages, prisons, and military camps. In 1990, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences </a>honored Cachupoy with the Lou Salvador Memorial Award for his achievements in show business. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Danny Villanueva</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

		"text": "<p><b>Canuplin&nbsp;</b>(<strong>Canuto Francia</strong>) was a stage and film actor and comedian. He was born in Tondo, Manila on 28 Jan&nbsp;1904. He died on 4 Sep&nbsp;1979.&nbsp;He and his wife Isabel raised their children in the Tondo area. One son, Canuplin Jr, helped him in his magic routines. He grew up in Divisoria, Manila, where his mother owned a <em>sari-sari</em> (variety) store, a livelihood that could hardly send all her eight children to school. The young Canuto stopped schooling at grade 4 to work as a houseboy. Sneaking out to watch Charlie Chaplin movies and playing in a neighborhood band were his favorite pastimes. His mother died when he was 10, and he had to work as shoeshine boy, earning 20 centavos a day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the age of 11, his fortunes turned. During the town parade, Canuto, dressed in a Chaplin costume, won first prize, and with it the chance to become a barker in the circus. From carnival crier he progressed to magician&rsquo;s assistant, and attracted the attention of one of the pioneers of <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">bodabil</a></em> in Manila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\">Lou Borromeo</a>. The bodabil impresario&nbsp;invited him to do a Chaplin act, and from then on he was known as Canuplin, a coinage from his name and that of Chaplin, his screen idol. Billed as the &ldquo;Charlie Chaplin of the Philippines&rdquo; at a time when many actors and singers strove to be Philippine versions of American performers, Canuplin began attracting crowds, playing in packed theaters. His act was that of a pathetic clown, a magician whose tricks frequently failed or were revealed to the audience. Between 1930 to 1934, he appeared with such local bodabil players as Patsy and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a>. The war years found Canuplin at his peak in show business, performing in major theaters like the Avenue, Lyric, Capitol, and Life. In the post-World War II years, he helped mold budding stage performers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also entered the movies, then at an experimental stage. Movie director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a> signed Canuplin up for various silent pictures, in which he played Chaplin. Later, he appeared in other pictures, including <strong><em>Morir Antes Pagar</em></strong> (Die Before Paying). He also appeared in such <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a> pictures as <strong><em>Aladin</em></strong>, 1946; <strong><em>Waling-waling</em></strong>, 1948; <strong><em>Si Eva at&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Si Adan</em></strong> (Eve and Adam), 1954; <strong><em>Ibong&nbsp;<strong>Adarna</strong></em></strong> (Adarna Bird), 1955; and <strong><em>Diyes Isang Kanta</em></strong> (Ten Centavos for a Song), 1961.

He was one of the most popular novelists of the vernacular magazines, known for his dramatic, colorful, stirring, and entertaining style. He used traditional themes and techniques in his novels. His sources of inspiration were old folk stories, epics, apocryphal stories in the Bible, and myths. The strong influence of the tradition of the <b>awit</b> and <b>korido</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>) can be clearly seen in his plots, in his use of rhetorical language, and even in his worldview.

He also wrote stories for film, such as <b><i>Higit sa Korona</i></b> (Above the Crown), 1956. Among the movies he directed for Premiere Productions were <b><i>Libre Comida</i></b> (Free Food), <b><i>Espadang Umaangil</i></b> (Roaring Sword), and <b><i>Prinsipe Alejandre at Don Luis</i></b> (Prince Alejandre and Don Luis), all in 1957; <b><i>May Pasikat Ba sa Kano? </i></b>(Are There American Show-Offs?) and <b><i>Ramadal</i></b>, 1958; <b><i>Duke de Borgonia</i></b> (Duke of Borgornia) and <b><i>Pilyong <strong>Kubrador</strong></i></b> (The Naughty Collector), 1959; and <b><i>Princesa Naranja</i></b>,<b><i> Party Line</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Sarhento Salcedo</i></b>, 1960. &nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Rosalinda Galang</strong></em></p>\r\n"

		"text": "<p><b>Luciano B. Carlos&nbsp;</b>(<strong><strong>Lucia</strong>no Balares Carlos</strong>), also known as Chaning Carlos, was a screenwriter and film director. He was born in Manila&nbsp;on 23 May 1928. He died in Las Vegas, USA on Nov 2002. He was the son of Cipriano Agulto Carlos and Juliana Laxamana Balares. He studied chemistry at the University of the Philippines Diliman, but reached up to second year only. He was married to Aurora Rodriguez with whom he had&nbsp;seven children. His nephew, Rahyan Carlos, is also a filmmaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carlos first wrote some speaking lines for the comedy team <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\">Chichay</a><strong> </strong> and Tolindoy in the movie <b><i>Baguio Cadets</i></b>,<i> </i>1950. Dr Jose Perez, satisfied with his work, assigned him a full script for <b><i>Tres Muskiteros</i></b><i> </i>(Three Musketeers), 1951, a comedy adaptation of Alexander Dumas&rsquo;s classic. It was a hit, and led to a sequel, <b><i>Tres Muskiteras</i></b><i> </i>(Three Lady Musketeers), 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing and/or directing exclusively for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\"> Sampaguita Pictures</a>, he made some of the company&rsquo;s most entertaining films, such as <b><i>Jack and Jill</i></b>,<i> </i>1954; <b><i>Dalagang Ilocana </i></b>(Ilocano Maiden), 1954; <b><i>Kuripot</i></b><i> </i>(Miser), 1955; <b><i>Mga <strong>Reyna ng Vicks</strong> </i></b>(Queens of Vicks), 1958; <b><i>Silveria</i></b>,<i> </i>1958; and <b>The <i>Big Broadcast</i></b>,<i> </i>1962. Later on, he directed movies for other companies like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a><strong> </strong> where he made a string of box-office hits including <em><strong>Inday Bote </strong> </em>(Inday the Bottle Woman),1985; <strong><em>Inday, Inday sa Balitaw </em></strong> (Inday, Inday of Balitaw),1986; <em><strong>Jack en Poy</strong> </em> (Jack and Poy), <em><strong>Maria Went to Town</strong> </em>, and <em><strong>Bunsong Kerubin</strong> </em> (Youngest Cherub), 1987; <em><strong>Super Inday and the Golden Bibe</strong> </em> (Super Inday and the Golden Duck) and <em><strong>Petrang Kabayo at ang Pilyang Kuting</strong> </em> (Petra the Horse and the Naughty Kitten), 1988; and <em><strong>Petrang Kabayo 2: Anong Ganda Mo! Mukha Kang Kabayo!</strong> </em> (Petra the Horse 2: How Pretty You Are! You Look Like a Horse!), 1990. Known for his movies that mix broad&nbsp;comedy with songs and dances, Carlos&#39;s&nbsp;style would later influence the work of younger filmmakers like Wenn Deramas whose 2010 remake of <em><strong>Petrang Kabayo</strong></em> starring comedian Vice Ganda became a blockbuster hit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carlos became the first Filipino to win an Asian Film Festival award, the Best Screenplay trophy for <b><i>Ang Asawa Kong Amerikana</i></b><i> </i>(My American Wife), 1953. In 1975, he won the Metropolitan Film Festival Best Screenplay award for <b><i>Batu-Bato sa Langit</i></b><i> </i>(Bird in the Sky). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Lena S.

He was born in&nbsp;San Pablo, Laguna on 16 Jul 1918. He died in Manila on&nbsp;27 Jan 1989. He was the son of Trinidad Gutierrez and Paulino Casimiro, a comedian of the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><em>komedya</em></a>. He finished elementary school at the Caloocan Elementary School. He married choreographer Nieves Manuel, with whom he had two children. His son Bayani Jr. is also an actor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At age seven, he entered show business as a clown and comedian, earning 50 centavos for his act. He loved to dance, particularly tap, and won in a song and dance contest at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a>. He also won in an amateur singing contest in 1928 for his rendition of &ldquo;Rainbow on the River.&rdquo; In 1936 he visited Hawaii as part of a performing troupe headed by Sarsuwela Queen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang dela Rama</a>. By the late 1930s, Casimiro&rsquo;s tap dancing had earned him the nickname &ldquo;The Fred Astaire of the Philippines,&rdquo; as he was often dressed up in top hat and tails like Fred Astaire. During this time, he headlined numerous&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">bodabil</a>&nbsp;</em>productions in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1938, Casimiro appeared in his first movie, Excelsior Films&rsquo; <strong><em>Bayan at Pag-ibig</em></strong> (Country and Love). After some time he transferred to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a> and later became part of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador</a>&rsquo;s stage shows. During World War II, when local film productions ceased, bodabil productions became the primary source of entertainment in Manila. Along with many other actors such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4299\">Norma Blancaflor</a>, Casimiro became very popular. It was also during this time that Casimiro met his stage partner Jose Cris Soto, and the two performed at the Life Theater in Manila. Because of the success of their team, they came to be known as the &ldquo;Oliver and Hardy of the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, Casimiro went back to his film career. In 1947, he met Rodolfo Vera Quizon Sr, better known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, who performed at the Orient Theater under the stage name &ldquo;Golay.&rdquo; The two became comic dance partners. Casimiro also continued to play small roles in more than a hundred films, such as <strong><em>Pilipino Kostum, No Touch </em></strong>(Filipino Custom, No Touch), 1955;&nbsp;<strong><em>Captain Barbell</em></strong>, 1973;&nbsp;<strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1135\"><strong>Burlesk Queen</strong></a></em></strong> (Burlesque Queen), 1977;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em><strong>Titser</strong>&rsquo;s Pet</em></strong> (Teacher&rsquo;s Pet), 1981.&nbsp;In his old age, Casimiro would still perform as character actor in film comedies, playing the role of an eccentric old man prone to ridicule, such as in <em><strong>E.T. (Estong Tutong)</strong></em>, 1983; <em><strong>Horsey&nbsp;Horsey&nbsp;Tigidig&nbsp;Tigidig</strong></em>, 1986; <em><strong>Buy One Take One</strong></em>, 1988; and <em><strong>Magic to Love</strong></em>, 1989.

With this film, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr</a> strengthened his image as a legendary gunslinger, a defender of the poor and oppressed. Castillo also made <b><i>Ang Alamat</i></b><i> </i>(The Legend), 1972, with Poe as a reluctant hero who battles a whole private army all by himself to defend his townsfolk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Succeeding Castillo films aspired toward thematic originality, with many explicitly covering controversial content, such as incest, rape, political and period gangsterism, which would earn him the label &ldquo;enfant terrible.&rdquo; It was Castillo who started a trend in Philippine movies known as the &ldquo;wet look,&rdquo; which later helped establish the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1061\"><b>bomba film</b></a> as a definite genre. His other notable films include <b><i>Nympha </i></b>(Nymph), 1971; <b><i>Ang Mahiwagang Daigdig ni Pedro Penduko</i></b><i> </i>(The Mysterious World of Pedro Penduko) and <b><i>Ang Pinakamagandang Hayop sa Balat ng Lupa</i></b><i> </i>(The Most Beautiful Animal on the Face of the Earth), 1973; <b><i>Patayin Mo sa Sindak si Barbara</i></b> (Kill Barbara with Fright), 1974; <b><i>Ang Madugong Daigdig ni Salvacion</i></b><i> </i>(The Bloody World of Salvacion) and <b><i>Tag-ulan sa Tag-araw</i></b><i> </i>(Rainy Days in Summer), 1975; <b><i><strong>Daluyong</strong> at Habagat </i></b>(Tall Waves and Wild Wind), 1976; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1135\"><strong>Burlesk Queen</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Burlesque Queen), 1977; <b><i><strong>Aliw</strong>-iw</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Ang Alamat ni Julian Makabayan</i></b><i> </i>(The Legend of Julian Makabayan), 1979; <b><i>Totoy Boogie</i></b>,<i> </i>1980; <b><i>Uhaw na Dagat</i></b><i> </i>(Thirsty Sea), 1981; <b><i>Pedro Tunasan</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Snake Sisters</i></b>,<i> </i>1983; <b><i>Virgin People</i></b>,<i> </i>1984; <b><i>Isla</i></b><i> </i>(Island), 1985; <b><i>Payaso</i></b><i> </i>(Clown), 1986; <b><i>Pikoy Goes to Malaysia</i></b>, 1988;<b><i> Tag-araw, Tag-ulan</i></b><i> </i>(Summer Days, Rainy Days),<b><i> </i></b>1992; <b><i>Kapag Iginuhit ang Hatol ng Puso</i></b> (When the Heart&rsquo;s Judgement Is Fated), 1993; <b><i>Comfort Women: A Cry for Justice</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1994; a remake of his earlier film, <b><i>Ang</i></b><i> <b>Pinakamagandang Hayop sa Balat ng Lupa</b></i>, 1996; <b><i>Virgin People 2</i></b>,<b> </b>1996; <b><i>Lihim ni Madonna</i></b> (Madonna&rsquo;s Secret), 1997; <b><i>Virgin People 3</i></b>, 2002; <b><i>Nympha</i></b>,<b> </b>2003, another remake; and the made-for-television <b><i>Medical Center</i></b>, 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From time to time, Castillo would appear in films and television series. He had a supporting role in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>&rsquo;s television series <b><i>Reputasyon</i></b> (Reputation), 2011-12.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>Catholic Mass Media Awards</strong> was established in 1978 under the auspices of the Archdiocese of Manila, through Archbishop Jaime Lachica Cardinal Sin. The awards are given in observance of International Social Communications Day to stress the importance of the mass media in the people&rsquo;s lives and to instill in communicators a sense of responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outstanding men and women and their works in mass media are chosen by a body of more than 50 jurors appointed by the archbishop of Manila. The jurors include academicians, civic and religious leaders, and the clergy. The awards are for 40 categories. The awards body stipulates that to be considered, works must be local productions produced and exhibited in the Archdiocese of Manila at any time during the year in consideration and must promote basic human values for total human development. These values include love for God, respect for the environment, positive Filipino values, and love for life. Over the years, CMMA has recognized works that reflect sensitivity to human rights and the integrity of creation; contribute to the country&rsquo;s economic growth; promote equity and accountability in the use of public resources and performance of public duties; portray nationalism and values of <i>pagkakaisa</i> (unity), <i>pagsasarili</i> (independence), <i>pakikipagkapwa-tao</i> (human relations), <i>pagkabayani</i> (heroism), and <i>pagiging makabuhay </i>(pro-life); and provide access to and participation by people, especially the poor. Awardees need not be Christian or Catholic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Winners are awarded a trophy called The Rock, a one-kilogram stone held on a wooden base with the staff of Saint Peter, a bronze banner, and an inscription: &ldquo;A tribute to the men and women who are serving God through media &ndash; Cardinal Sin.&rdquo; The trophy is composed of several symbolic figures: the rock, which underscores the role of the Catholic Church as the foundation of Filipino values in media; the mirror, which represents the Church&rsquo;s desire to reflect Catholic standards that bring about transformative changes in society; the curved figure with an upward movement, which represents a transformed Philippine society through the responsible use of mass media; and the two figures, which symbolize the harmonious mother-and-child relationship. Cesario &ldquo;Jhundy&rdquo; P. de Lina Jr designed in 2000 the current CMMA trophy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CMMA has seven categories for media, one category for student works, and four special awards. Media categories include print, television, radio, film, advertising, music, and the Internet. Initially, the CMMA recognized communicators only in print, television, radio, and film in Manila. It added advertising in 1979 and music in 1980. In 1984, it began including entries from all over the country for assessment. In 2001, it added the category for the Internet, in response to the increased usage and distribution of content in new media platforms. On 7 Feb 2001, it instituted the Student CMMA, which recognizes the role of the youth in raising social consciousness through the media. In 2004, it began recognizing institutions and individuals with the Serviam Awards, primarily as a tribute to its founder, Cardinal Sin. The Pope John Paul Awards are given to a group or a person that creatively utilizes the mass media in evangelical service. The Hall of Fame Award is conferred on a mass media work that has won the CMMA for the same category for five times, though not necessarily in consecutive years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A significant year in the history of the CMMA was 1981, when Pope John Paul II personally handed out the trophies at the Radio Veritas auditorium. In 1986, after the EDSA Revolt, communicators who served the resistance against the Marcos dictatorship, including foreign media persons, were all given recognition. The body of jurors also began to include members of the academe, civil society, and public service. CMMA took a hiatus from 1998 to 1999. Following its return in 2000, it expanded from being just an award-giving body and organized in 2001 the first CMMA Media Fair. In 2013, social networks were featured as &ldquo;new spaces for evangelization.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first awardee for print in 1978 was Herky del Aguila&rsquo;s &ldquo;Service and Struggle in the Mountainsides,&rdquo; which was awarded Best Feature Article. In 1979, new awards for print were conferred. Best Comic Story was &ldquo;Santiago&rdquo; by Jose Lad Santos, <b><i>Silangan <strong>Komiks</strong></i></b>; Best Book in English was <b><i>Myths and Symbols of the Philippines</i></b> by Father Francisco Demetrio, SJ; best opinion piece in English was &ldquo;Reflections&rdquo; by Father Miguel Bernad, SJ, <b><i>Philippine Daily Inquirer</i></b>; best feature article in English was &ldquo;Bicutan Behind Bars&rdquo; by Chelo R. Banal, <b><i>Panorama Magazine</i></b>; and best feature article in Filipino was Noel Cabrera&rsquo;s &ldquo;MYRC Series,&rdquo; <b><i>Philippine Daily Express</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first awardees for radio in 1978 were <b><i>In Unum Deum </i></b>(In One God), DZRH, best program; Err Ramos as best director for the drama program <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday); and Ric T. Santos, best writer for the drama episode &ldquo;Buhay Pa si Plato&rdquo; (Plato Lives On), DWRV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first awardees for television in 1978 were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fate), BBC 2, best program in value formation; <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko</i></b> (I Love my Fellowman), GMA 7, best public service program; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b>, PTV 4, best program for cultural development.

He is a National Artist for music and literature. He was born in Tondo, Manila on 30 Apr 1910. He died in Quezon City on 2 Apr 2002. He was the son of Cornelio Cruz, a native of Baliuag, Bulacan and Juliana Celerio of San Pablo, Laguna. He grew up in the slums of Tondo and went to the public elementary school there. At age 11, he started taking violin lessons from a Philippine Constabulary (PC) musician and became a member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4121\">PC Band</a> while attending classes at Torres High School. He finished two semesters of violin at the University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\">Alexander Lippay</a>, then director of the Conservatory, recommended him for a scholarship at the Academy of Music of Manila and also made it possible for him to become the youngest member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a>. However, a fall from a tree, which resulted in a broken wrist, ended Celerio&rsquo;s dream of becoming a violinist.

		"text": "<p><b>Behn Cervantes&nbsp;</b>(<strong>Benjamin Holcombe&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cervantes</strong>) was a theater and film director and actor, television director, and teacher. He was born in Iloilo on 26 Aug 1938. He died in Manila on 15 Aug 2013. He was the ninth of the 11 children of Cenon Cervantes and Rosario Elizabeth Holcombe, an American. After World War II, Cervantes finished his elementary studies at a small exclusive school in Iloilo and high school at De La Salle University in Manila. He took a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in speech and drama at the University of the Philippines (UP), and a master&rsquo;s degree in theater arts at the University of Hawaii. He also studied drama and film at Columbia University and at Beloit College in Wisconsin. He taught theater courses at UP from 1967 up to his early retirement in 1989. He also taught at De La Salle University and Philippine Christian University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His theater activism led him underground when martial law was declared in 1972. He was arrested four times between 1972 and 1985, but continued to lead the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\">Company</a>, which he founded and guided as a nationalist theater company since 1974. In 1983, he and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> spearheaded the Free the Artist Movement which gave birth to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a>, which Cervantes chaired for three years. He served on the National Council of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan; on the Council of SINING, an organization of cultural organizations; and in various nationalist and cultural organizations. He was a founding member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> in 1967 and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a> in 1975; and was also a member of the Board of Trustees of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) in 2009-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While in college, he joined the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3335\">UP&nbsp;Dramatic Club</a>, and appeared in such plays as <strong><em>No Exit</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Caine Mutiny Court Martial</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Murder in the Cathedral</em></strong>. In the United States he worked in a summer company in Wisconsin, appearing in plays like <strong><em>Waiting for Godot&nbsp;</em></strong>and the Nigerian play <strong><em>Swamp&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Dwellers</em></strong>. In Manila he also acted with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2746\">Arena Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2769\">Barangay Theater Guild</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3077\">Manila Theater Guild</a>, and later PETA and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a>. Among his memorable roles are the Mikado in <strong><em>The Mikado</em></strong>, Marquis de Sade in <strong><em>Marat/Sade</em></strong>, Rene Gallimard in <strong><em>M. Butterfly</em></strong>, Mr Guildenstern in <strong><em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead</em></strong>, and Candido in the male version of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\"><strong><em><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></em></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His first directorial work included directing Lino Brocka in a scene from the UP Dramatic Club&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mr. Roberts&nbsp;</em></strong>and another from <strong><em>Anastasia</em></strong>. In the 1960s and early 1970s, he directed mainly Western plays in English, such as Federico Garcia Lorca&rsquo;s <strong><em>The House of Bernarda Alba</em></strong>, Ferenc Molnar&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Play&rsquo;s the Thing</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em></strong>. After his politicization in the 1970s, he turned to politically committed theater in Filipino. He joined the Samahang Demokratikong Kabataan (SDK), and later became resident director of SDK&rsquo;s theater group, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a>. Cervantes&rsquo;s first Tagalog plays were <strong><em>Alay kay <strong>Ka Amado</strong></em></strong> (Offering to Ka Amado), 1971, and <strong><em>Barikada</em></strong> (Barricade), 1971, a multimedia experiment reenacting the nine-day &ldquo;Diliman Commune&rdquo; at the height of the First Quarter Storm in 1970. He designed proletarian theater techniques for the time and its needs&mdash;for example, using a <strong>koro</strong> (chorus) because there were no microphones during rallies and discussing the play with the audience after the performance. He took Gintong Silahis to rallies at Plaza Miranda, to communities and schools, and to the streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the UP Repertory Company, he directed <strong><em>Sobresaltos</em></strong> (Sudden Fears), 1973; <strong><em>Butil ng&nbsp;</em><em>Buhay</em></strong> (Grain of Life) from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5030\">Estrella Alfon</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bigas</em></strong> (Rice), 1973; <strong><em>The Heart of Emptiness&nbsp;</em><em>Is Black</em></strong>, 1974; <strong><em>Palabas ni Suwan</em></strong> (Suwan&rsquo;s Show), <strong><em>Dahil sa <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong></em></strong> (Because of the Child), and <strong><em>Sino Ba Kayo</em></strong> ?

He is also known for <strong><em>Guys and Dolls</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Short, Short Life of Citizen Juan</em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/569\"><strong>Iskolar ng Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (Scholar of the People). He also directed translations such as <strong><em>El Extensionista</em></strong> (<strong><em>The Agricultural Expert</em></strong>), 1984, and <strong><em>Ang Reyna at mga Rebelde</em></strong> (<strong><em>The Queen and the Rebels</em></strong>), 1986; and plays in English such as <strong><em>Agnes of God</em></strong>, 1988, and <strong><em>Twelve Angry Women</em></strong>, 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cervantes also directed for film and television. His film debut, <strong><em><strong>Sakada</strong></em></strong> (Seasonal Cane Workers), 1976, was hailed by critics but banned after a few days of exhibition by the Marcos military. He directed other films and became a member of the directors&rsquo; guild of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines</a>. Among the programs that he directed for TV was the miniseries <strong><em>Angkan</em></strong> (Clan). He also contributed articles on theater in the <strong><em>Philippine Daily Inquirer</em></strong> and <strong><em>Business World</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cervantes was given the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989; the CCP Centennial Honors for the Arts in 1999; the Aliw Lifetime Achievement Award in 2010; and the UP Alumni Lifetime Distinguished Achievement Award in 2013. Cervantes won third prize in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\">Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a> for his English full-length play titled <strong><em>Istorya ni Bonipasyo: Kasla Gloria ti Hawaii</em></strong> (Bonipasyo&rsquo;s Story: Hawaii Is Like Paradise) in 1997. He is also listed in the East-West Center&rsquo;s Wall of Honor in Hawaii.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5094\"><strong>Joi Barrios</strong></a></strong></strong></strong> and Malou L.

He was born in Manila on 12 Mar 1928. He died in Makati City&nbsp;on 2 Jul 1997. He was the son of&nbsp;Remedios Valdez and Manuel Eric Pangan, an executive of San Miguel Corporation. He&nbsp;studied at P. Gomez Elementary School and finished high school at Mapua Institute of Technology. He was married to his former dancing partner Vilma Isidro, with whom he had&nbsp;seven children. One of his daughters, Eliza, had a brief career as a comedienne&nbsp;acting in some of her father&#39;s movies, with the moniker Bukol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Japanese Occupation, Chiquito was only 13 when he joined the shows of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a>. At 14, he was appearing in stage shows at Life Theater. He learned all the ballroom dances of the time, especially the boogie, which he danced so well that he was fondly called &ldquo;Tito Boogista&rdquo; by his peers. He also performed at Inday Theater and Clover Theater, where he caught the attention of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4602\">Fernando Poe Sr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, Poe gave him a chance to appear as an extra in his movie production, <b><i>Death March</i></b>,<i> </i>1947. He was introduced with Ben Cosca (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4294\">Bentot</a>) as the comedy team in <b><i>Ganyan Ka Pala </i></b>(So That&rsquo;s the Way You Are), 1956, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\">Nida Blanca</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4396\">Nestor de Villa</a> starrer.

Carlos</a>. He also spoofed a Brocka film with his own <b><i>Tinimbang Ka, Bakit Husto?</i></b><i> </i>(You Were Weighed and Found Exact?), 1977. The success of his Sotang Bastos<i> </i>(Jack of Clubs) series where he plays a real-life role as race jockey prompted him to put up his own Sotang Bastos Productions in the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years before his death, Chiquito appeared in a number of comedy movies alongside&nbsp;younger comedians like Andrew E. in <em><strong>Pinagbiyak na Bunga</strong></em> (Lookalikes), 1994, and <em><strong>Bangers</strong></em>, 1995, and Janno Gibbs in <em><strong>Ang Pagbabalik ni Pedro Penduko</strong></em> (The Return of Pedro Penduko), 1994. <em><strong>Pinagbiyak na Bunga</strong></em> was turned into a short-lived comedy series on GMA Network titled <em><strong>D&#39; Lookalayks: Puno&#39;t Bunga</strong></em> (The Lookalikes: Tree and Fruit).

		"text": "<p><strong>Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival</strong>&nbsp;is an annual festival of locally produced full-length films, documentaries, restored film classics and contemporary masterpieces, and select short films, as well as internationally acclaimed movies. It started in 2005 as a project of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> subsidiary Creative Programs Incorporated to encourage local film production, beef up the content of Cinema One, ABS-CBN&rsquo;s cable movie channel, and serve as venue for the best films of Philippine and world cinema. The festival began to be held in July for three days in selected cinemas in Metro Manila. Currently, it is now being held for 10 days every November in selected cinemas in and outside Metro Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2006, the festival introduced a competition category where local filmmakers from all over the country are invited to submit screenplays. A selection committee, headed by Cinema One channel head Ronald Arguelles, chooses finalists based on the quality of their scripts and their capacity to mount a full-length film project. The finalists are then given a production budget to finance their film&rsquo;s production. When it started in 2005, only five finalists were selected to compete in the festival, and each of them were given 700,000 pesos. The cash grant was raised to one million pesos in 2007. The following year, the number of finalists also increased to seven. In 2012, the festival divided the competition into two categories: the Plus Category, where five films were given two million pesos each, and the Currents Category, where 10 films were granted one million pesos each. In 2014, however, the two categories were dissolved but the cash grant was raised to three million pesos. Over the years, the number of narrative films in competition increased to as many as 10 films. The short film category was introduced in 2014. While Cinema One is the exclusive owner of the screening and distribution rights of the submitted films in competition, grantees became co-owners of their works in 2011 as percentage sharing was introduced by the organizers in order to encourage more Filipino filmmakers to tell their stories through the medium of cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cinema One has become one of the most exciting film-related events in the country and a launching pad for some of the country&rsquo;s young and fresh talents, both on and behind the camera. When the competition category started in 2006, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4670\">Sherad Anthony Sanchez</a>&rsquo;s <span class=\"CharacterStyle1\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><i>Huling Balyan ng Buhi</i></span><span class=\"CharacterStyle1\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><i> </i></span><span class=\"CharacterStyle1\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">(<em><strong>Woven Stories of the Other</strong></em>) was chosen as the festival&rsquo;s first Best Film winner.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the directors whose careers were launched by Cinema One Originals are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a>, Sherad Anthony Sanchez, Jason Paul Laxamana, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4690\">Richard Somes</a>, <span class=\"CharacterStyle1\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"IT\" style=\"font-weight:normal\">Remton Siega Zuasola, and Antoinette Jadaone. </span></span><span class=\"CharacterStyle1\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">More recent discoveries include the likes of Sigrid Andrea Bernardo, Eduardo Dayao, and Petersen Vargas. Some of the films in the festival have also been screened in film festivals abroad, won recognition in international and local award-giving bodies, and are now regarded as significant works in the canon of contemporary Philippine cinema.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The festival is also known for bringing regional cinema into the spotlight with the likes of Keith Deligero, Victor Kaiba Villanueva, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4528\">Gutierrez Mangansakan II</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4365\">Sheron Dayoc</a>, to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The festival continues to evolve parallel to the changing needs of Philippine contemporary cinema, together with all the progressive film festivals spawned by the digital film revolution in the early 2000s. Cinema One Originals continues to pave the way towards one diverse but united Philippine cinema. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4839\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Elmer L.

Coching </strong>(<b><strong><strong><strong>Francisco Vicente</strong></strong></strong> Coching</b>) is a&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">komiks</a></em> illustrator and National artist for visual arts. He was born in&nbsp;Buting, Pasig, Rizal on 29 Jan 1919. He died on&nbsp;1 Sep 1998.&nbsp;He was the son of fictionist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5177\">Gregorio Coching</a> and Juana Vicente. His brother Vito is a sculptor, and another brother, Greco, is a set designer. He was married to Filomena Navales with whom he had six children, two of whom are portrait artists&mdash;Maridel and Lourdes. Francisco left school at an early age to work for the magazine <strong><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\">Liwayway</a></i></strong> where his father was a novelist. Coching apprenticed with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1934, he created his first komiks<i> </i>character, Bing Bigotilyo, for the magazine <b><i>Silahis</i></b> and the year after, Marabini or &ldquo;marahas na binibini&rdquo; (reckless maiden), which was abruptly ended by the onset of war. During the war years, he joined a guerrilla group, the Kamagong Unit of the Hunters-ROTC. After the war, he created <b><i>Bulalakaw</i></b>. However, it was <b><i><strong><strong><strong>Hagibis</strong></strong></strong></i></b>, his next work, that won him fame. <b><i>Hagibis</i></b>, which was inspired by <b><i>Kulafu</i></b> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3735\">Francisco Reyes</a> and <b><i>Tarzan</i></b> of Edgar Rice Burroughs, ran for 15 years in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> and was followed by sequels: <b><i><strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ni Hagibis</i></b> (Son of Hagibis) and <b><i>Si Gat Sibasib</i></b> (Gat Sibasib). Coching&rsquo;s creations were sought out by producers who made movies from them, such as <b><i>Hagibis</i></b>, 1947,<b><i> </i></b>with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\">Fernando Poe</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4348\">Erlinda Cortes</a>; <b><i>Satur</i></b>, 1951, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>; <b><i>Sabas: Ang Barbaro</i></b> (Sabas: The Barbarian), 1951, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\">Pancho Magalona</a>; <b><i>Palasig</i></b>, 1952, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\">Gloria Romero</a>; <b><i>Maldita</i></b> (Naughty), 1953, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4460\">Rita Gomez</a>; and <b><i>Movie Fan</i></b>, 1956, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4447\">Amalia Fuentes</a>. All but five of his komiks novels were made into movies. His other well-known works are <b><i>Bertong <strong>Balut</strong>an</i></b>, <b><i>Don Cobarde</i></b>, <b><i>El Ligio</i></b>, <b><i>Espada</i></b> (Sword), <b><i>Agilang <strong>Itim</strong></i></b> (Black Eagle), <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2200\"><strong>El Indio</strong></a></strong></i></b> (The Native), <b><i>Pedro Penduko</i></b>, <b><i>Dumagit</i></b>, <b><i>Lapu-Lapu</i></b>, <b><i>Salabusab</i></b> (Greedy), <b><i>Pusakal</i></b> (Hardened Criminal), <b><i>Ang Maton</i></b> (The Tough Guy), <b><i><strong>Taga sa Bato</strong></i></b> (Cut on a Stone), <b><i>Talipandas</i></b> (Wayward), <b><i>Vengativo</i></b> (Prone to Vengeance), <b><i>Thor</i></b>, <b><i>Pistolero </i></b>(The Gunman), <b><i>Dimasalang</i></b>, <b><i>El Vibora </i></b>(The Viper), <b><i>Ang Kaluluwa ni Dante</i></b> (Dante&rsquo;s Soul), <b><i>Pagano </i></b>(Pagan), <b><i>Haring Ulupong</i></b> (King Cobra), <b><i>Bulalakaw</i></b> (Shooting Star), <b><i>Waldas</i></b> (Spendthrift), and <b><i>Contravida</i></b> (Villain). Many of these appeared in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>. At his peak, he was writing and illustrating three weekly serials simultaneously. Coching both wrote and illustrated his stories. His works had a strong narrative flow, brimmed with drama, and were punctuated by action and suspense. His illustrative style belonged to the romantic tradition of komiks illustration, which he dominated from 1934 to 1974, the year he retired, authoring 63 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">komiks</a> novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His last novel, <b><i>El Negro</i></b>, was published in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> and was turned into a film in 1974. The style was characterized by dynamic curvilinear lines and tonal modeling with a fluid, undulating effect. The leading male characters are stalwart in build, and of handsome mestizo or Malay looks, with curly hair and rippling muscles. The female leads are beautiful, graceful of build, and usually with long curly tresses. It is a style that gives life to the myths and legends of yore and to fantasies of love and adventure. Coching influenced other artists, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3732\">Nestor Redondo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\">Larry Alcala</a>, Emil Quizon-Cruz, and Emil Rodriguez, to pursue the art of komiks illustration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An exhibit of his works opened at Nayong Pilipino in 1987. In 2001, an exhibit titled <b><i>Komiks: Katha at Guhit ni Francisco V. Coching</i></b> (Komiks: Stories and Drawings of Francisco V. Coching) opened at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP). In 2009, another exhibit titled <b><i>Francisco V. Coching: Filipino Master Komiks Artist</i></b> was shown in New York and Hawaii. Coching&rsquo;s restored <b><i>El Indio: A Graphic <strong>Novel</strong></i></b> was published by Vibal Foundation. A dual exhibit with National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>, titled <b><i>Telling Modern Time</i>: <i>The Life and Art of <strong>Botong</strong> Francisco</i> <i>and Francisco</i></b><i> <b>Coching</b></i>, opened at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> also in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1981, he received the Makasining ng Komiks Award at the Tanging Parangal for Comics Art given by the Manila Commission of Arts and Culture. In 1984, he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Komiks Operation Brotherhood Inc. Other awards include an Award for Excellence by the Pasay City government in 1998 for his contribution to the local art scene and a Gawad CCP para sa Sining for visual arts in 2008.

		"text": "<p><strong>Gregorio Coching&nbsp;</strong>(<b>Gregorio Cabral Coching</b>), also known as Gat Kalingkingan, was a fictionist. He was born in<b> </b>Buting, Pasig on 13 May 1892. He died in Pasig on 18 Oct 1961. He was the son of Juan Coching and Andrea Cabral. The name Coching originated from his ancestor&rsquo;s original province, Kuching, located in North Borneo. He married twice: first, to Juana Vicente, with whom he had five children; second, to Sixta Cagalingan, who bore him a son. Three sons are artists: Vito is a sculptor, Greco is a set designer, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3477\">Francisco</a> was a well-known <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">komiks</a></em><strong> </strong>illustrator and is a National Artist for visual arts. Coching received his early education from his relatives in Tondo, in a school called La Juventud, where he learned Spanish and Latin. At an early age, he became interested in metrical romances; he memorized <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><i><strong><strong>Florante&nbsp;</strong></strong>at Laura</i></a> </b>(Florante and Laura) and read <b><i>Don Juan Te&ntilde;oso </i></b>and <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1880\"><i>Ibong&nbsp;<strong>Adarna</strong></i></a> </b>(Adarna Bird). After his father&rsquo;s death, his mother moved the family to Pasay. Young Gregorio helped his mother earn a living by selling newspapers in the streets. They must have undergone very hard times, for at 15 he attempted to commit suicide. However, as he was making ready to plunge himself into a deep well, he saw miraculously carved on a guava branch a ladle which was his own handiwork and which he had left at home. From then on, he saw poverty in another light as he began using his hands to make engravings. That incident, in later years, would influence most of his novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His first attempt at writing began in 1925 when he joined a novel writing contest sponsored by <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></strong></i></b>. His entry <b><i>Sanggumay</i></b> won first prize and 200 pesos. The novel, published in 1933, centers on Loleng, a once wealthy woman now impoverished, driven to prostitution to support and save a sick father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His other novels include <b><i>Baliya</i></b>, which recounts the unsuccessful courtship of a woman by a Chinese; <b><i>Nita Ravensky</i></b>, about a Filipino adventurer who goes abroad and marries a princess; <b><i>Okami San</i></b>, about a Japanese woman who falls in love with a Filipino at much sacrifice; and <b><i>Dalagang Pangit</i></b> (Ugly Maiden), 1933, the love story of an ugly woman with a shapely body. Those that appeared serially in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, for which he received 25 pesos per installment, include <b><i>Dama de Noche</i></b> (Woman of the Night), about a <i>bailarina</i><b> </b>(dancer) and a newspaperman; <b><i>Nanay Ko</i></b> (My Mother), the heartbreaking tale of a daughter unrecognized by her mother; and a translation of John Milton&rsquo;s <b><i>Paradise Lost </i></b>(<b><i>Ang Naglahong Paraiso</i></b>).<i> </i>Two of his novels were filmed, <b><i>Teniente Rosario</i></b> (Lieutenant Rosario) and <b><i>Ilaw ng Langit</i></b> (Light of Heaven). He also wrote <b><i>Babae ng Bayan</i></b> (Everybody&rsquo;s Woman), <b><i>Batang Tulisan</i></b> (Young Bandit), <b><i>Gagamba </i></b>(Spider), <b><i>Kathlea</i></b>, <b><i>Kidlat ng Silangan</i></b> (Lightning of the East), <b><i>Mga <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ng Kadiliman </i></b>(Children of Darkness), <b><i>Pag-ibig at Paghihiganti </i></b>(Love and Revenge), <b><i>Puso ng Diyos</i></b> (Heart of God), <b><i>Sa Impierno ng Ating Lahi </i></b>(In the Hell of Our Race), <b><i>Sa Langit ng Ating Lahi</i></b> (In the Heaven of Our Race), <b><i>Tatlong Pagkabirhen</i></b> (Three Virginities), and <b><i>Ulupong</i></b> (Viper).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1927 onward, he was part of the <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> staff. In 1945, he joined the staff of <b><i>Silahis</i></b>, publishing his novels <b><i>Mutya ng Mutya</i></b> (Gem of Gems) and <b><i>Pamanang Binhi</i></b> (Heirloom Seedlings). He also wrote for <b><i>Bulaklak</i></b>. &nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E.

The movie was shown in Edinburgh Film Festival the following year and became the first Filipino film distributed worldwide by United Artists (UA). <b><i>Sigfredo </i></b>and <b><i>Siete Infantes de Lara</i></b> were also bought and distributed by UA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After returning to LVN, Conde directed <b><i>Se&ntilde;orito </i></b>(Spoiled Brat), 1953; <b><i>Pilipino Kostum, No Touch</i></b> (Filipino Custom, No Touching) and <b><i>Ikaw Kasi</i></b> (You Are to Blame), 1955; <b><i>Handang Matodas</i></b> (Ready to Die) and <b><i>Bahala Na</i></b> (Come What May), 1956; and <b><i>Tingnan Natin</i></b> (We&rsquo;ll See), <b><i>El Robo</i></b> (The Robbery), and <b><i>Basta Ikaw</i></b> (As Long as It&rsquo;s You), 1957; <b><i>Casa Grande</i></b> (Mansion) and <b><i>Venganza</i></b> (Revenge), 1958; and <b><i><strong>Bayani</strong>han </i></b>(Community Spirit), 1959.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conde, however, is best remembered for his Juan Tamad<i> </i>series, which he starred in and directed, and most of which were produced by his own outfit.

He completed a music degree in piano and cello from the UST and a master&rsquo;s degree in music education from Santa Isabel College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A seasoned performer, Cuenco played with the Filipino Youth Symphony Orchestra and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a> from 1960 to 1968, and the Manila Chamber Soloists from 1966 to 1970 organized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4234\">Oscar C. Yatco</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4063\">Basilio C. Manalo</a>. In 1983 and 1987, he toured the United States with other Filipino performers and artists including the Kayumangging Kaligatan, a choral group he founded in 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cuenco was at one time or another on the faculty of the music departments of several major schools and colleges in Manila including the UST Conservatory of Music, where he taught for decades. He also helped initiate the annual <b><i>Sampung Daliri</i></b> (Ten Fingers) concert of the UST Conservatory of Music, featuring their piano faculty, alumni, and students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He wrote award-winning musical scores for Filipino films. His first commission came in the early 1960s, for movie producer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a>. For the next two decades, he continued scoring for numerous films and writing some of the most memorable songs, often in collaboration with lyricist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3934\">Levi Celerio</a>. His works include <b><i>Diligin Mo ng Hamog ang Uhaw na Lupa </i></b>(Sprinkle Dew on the Parched Land), 1975, and <b><i>Bakya Mo, Neneng </i></b>(Your Wooden Clogs, Neneng), 1977, both awardees of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> for Best Musical Score; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/868\">&quot;Bato sa Buhangin&quot;</a>&nbsp;(Stone in the Sand), 1976, FAMAS Awardee for Best Theme Song, 1976; <b><i>Ang Babaing Pinagtaksilan ng Panahon </i></b>(A Woman Betrayed by Time), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Gawad Urian</a> for Best Music, 1980; and <b><i>Pedrong Taruc</i></b>,1982, and <b><i>Isang Bala Ka Lang </i></b>(You&rsquo;re Only Worth a Bullet), 1983, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP)</a> awardees for Best Musical Score. His greatest hit, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/892\">&ldquo;Gaano Ko Ikaw&nbsp;Kamahal&rdquo;</a> (How Much Do I Love You), 1979, shows how Cuenco enriched the Filipino love ballad by infusing it with elements of the classic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>kundiman</b></a>. His song &ldquo;Kahit na Magtiis&rdquo; (As I Endure) with words by Joseph Ejercito Estrada became a hit when the latter assumed the Philippine presidency in 1998. Its revival by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\">Philippine Madrigal Singers</a> with an arrangement by Christopher Borela lent prestige to the composition, and was included in the choir&rsquo;s live concert recording of their international tour of 2000, titled <b><i>Around the World</i></b> in 2001. Another recent recording of his music is Renato Lucas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\">Raul Sunico</a>&rsquo;s rendition of his love song, &ldquo;Nahan&rdquo; (Where?) in the album <b><i>Romanza</i></b>, released by Tawid Publications in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cuenco was posthumously conferred the CCP Centennial Honors for the Arts, and the National Artist award in 1999.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Julie Ann Hallazgo, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4191\"><strong>Arwin Q.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>Cultural Center of the Philippines</b>&nbsp;(<strong>CCP</strong>) is the leading institution in the country that plans and implements programs for the development and promotion of the arts&mdash;music, dance, theater, visual, literary, cinematic, and broadcast arts. Since 1969 when it was created by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos, it has sponsored programs and activities such as festivals, exhibitions, competitions, and publications to preserve, promote, and enhance the artistic and cultural heritage of the Filipino people, and to develop audiences that will appreciate and support artistic and cultural work. It is home to nine resident companies that present regular seasons of productions, workshops, and outreach performances: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"> Ballet Philippines</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\">Philippine Ballet Theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\">Philippine Madrigal Singers</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>, and UST Symphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitting on a 60-hectare complex on Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, the CCP is part of a vast international network of arts and culture organizations that provide exchange opportunities between Filipino artists and artists from all over the world. This network also brings in performances and exhibitions that allow local audiences to experience arts and cultures from elsewhere. These organizations include the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Center, the Conseil International des Organisations de Festivals de Folklore et d&rsquo;Arts Traditionnels, the World Dance Alliance, the International Theater Institute, the Asian Theater Alliance, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, and the ASEAN&ndash;Korea Traditional Music Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is composed of several departments that promote arts education, direct outreach and exchange programs all over the country, mount productions and exhibitions, manage cultural holdings, and develop its assets. In its first two decades the CCP focused on what were later perceived as elitist performing arts&mdash;theater, ballet, opera, and similar shows&mdash;a bias that was shaped by its first board of trustees chair, then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos. Following the successful EDSA revolt against Marcos and his martial rule and the subsequent change in the country&rsquo;s leadership, the CCP expanded its scope to include literature, film, and broadcast arts, among others. It also reoriented its direction to emphasize original Filipino artistic and cultural expressions rooted in the Philippines and the participation of the regions in the definition of a national culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music. </b>The CCP is home to the country&rsquo;s premier symphonic orchestra, the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO). Established in 1973, the PPO (then known as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra) initially accompanied local and foreign performing artists at the CCP. It later evolved as one of the best music ensembles in the Asia-Pacific region, premiering works by Filipino and foreign composers, and promoting music appreciation throughout the country. Past conductors and musical directors of the PPO include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\">Luis Valencia</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\">Oscar Yatco</a>, Ruggero Barbieri, Olivier Ochanine, and Yoshikazu Fukumura.Among the internationally renowned conductors who have performed with the PPO are Mendi Rodan, Piero Gamba, Enrique Batis, Sebastian Bereau, and Nicholas Koch. Some of the world&rsquo;s best Filipino and foreign artists have also performed with the PPO, including Van Cliburn, Renata Tebaldi, Judith Engel, Anthony Camden, David Benoit, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\">Cecile Licad</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\">Raul Sunico</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"> Lea Salonga</a>. The PPO is now on its 34th concert season. It has toured in Europe, Asia, and more recently, the United States, when it performed for the first time at the Carnegie Hall. Aside from its regular concert seasons at the CCP, the PPO also participates in the CCP Outreach Program by performing in public spaces and conducting workshops in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another resident company of the CCP is the Philippine Madrigal Singers. Organized in 1963 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\">Andrea O. Veneracion</a>, later National Artist for music, the choir is composed of students, teachers, and alumni from the various colleges of the University of the Philippines. Performing a wide repertoire of various styles and forms, the ensemble has consistently won all the top prizes in most of the world&rsquo;s prestigious choral competitions. The choir also maintains an active outreach and concert schedule every year and is regarded as one of the country&rsquo;s most active ambassadors of goodwill and one of the world&rsquo;s most traveled choirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UST Symphony Orchestra is also a resident performing group of the CCP. It holds regular concerts at the CCP and participates in the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program. It also serves as a pool for additional players as the needs of the PPO dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, the CCP launched the <b><i>Filipino Artists Series</i></b> (FAS), a monthly program featuring solo performances of acclaimed and emerging Filipino musical artists. Among those featured in the FAS were bass baritone Jonathan Zaens; flutist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4057\">Antonio Maigue</a>; cellist Wilfredo Pasamba; pianists Corazon Kabayao, Mariel Illusorio, Peter Porticos, and Rene Dalandan; violinists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"> Gilopez Kabayao</a>, Gina Medina, and Denise Huang; and sopranos Clarissa Ocampo and Maria Cristina Viguilla-Navarro. FAS was discontinued in 2009 but was later revived in 2012 as the <b><i>Special Concert Series</i></b>. Some of the performing artists in this series are pianist Charisse Baldoria, soprano Katrina Saporsantos, cellist Antoni Josef Inacay, trumpet player Raymond de Leon, percussionist Aimee Mina dela Cruz, and flutist Sarah Mae Gabuyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP also embarked on the production of Filipino operas as well as Western operas that were adapted to a Philippine setting. In 1970, it partnered with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\">Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</a> in producing <b><i><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong> </i></b> (Subversion), the operatic adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"> Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\">novel</a>, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3965\">Felipe Padilla de Leon</a> and libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>. De Leon and Tolentino&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> </a>(Touch Me Not), first staged at the FEU Auditorium in 1957, was also restaged at the CCP in 1974, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3956\"> Don David </a> as Ibarra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4158\">Ruby Salazar</a> as Maria Clara, Jimmy Melendres as Padre Damaso, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\">Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</a> as Sisa. In 1984, the CCP and Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines commissioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\">Francisco Feliciano</a> to create the three-act opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a></i></b> (The Black She-wolf), with libretto by Cuyugan-Asensio. In 1987, the CCP partnered with Music Theater Foundation in another restaging of <b><i>Noli&hellip;</i></b> this time with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3920\">Nolyn Cabahug</a> as Ibarra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3982\">Andion Fernandez</a> as Maria Clara, and Cuyugan-Asensio as Sisa (alternating with Luz Morete). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>&rsquo;s Philippine adaptation of <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> and <b><i>La Boheme</i></b> were also produced by and staged at the CCP in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Two major opera productions of the CCP in the 21st century were <b><i><strong> <strong>Spoliarium</strong> </strong> </i></b>, 2003, and <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b>, 2012. <b><i>Spoliarium</i></b> was inspired by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> &rsquo;s life and masterpiece, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a> and libretto by Fides Cuyugan-Asensio, and co-produced by the CCP with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4106\">Opera Guild of the Philippines</a><b>&nbsp;</b>and Music Theater Foundation of the Philippines. <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b> was a co-production of the CCP and MusicArtes, Inc, with director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3017\">Anton Juan</a> giving local flavor to Puccini&rsquo;s famous opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is also the organizer and main proponent of major music festivals including the biennial Andrea Veneracion International Choral Festival and the CCP International Jazz Festival which was merged with the Orchestra and Symphonic Band Festival, and the annual Flute/Woodwind Festival. It has also been actively supporting the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA) since its inception in 1973. The CCP Arts Education Department also organizes masterclasses of renowned musical artists as well as yearly workshops in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/803\"><b>rondalla</b> </a>music, choral music, and band music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Dance. </b>The CCP has four resident dance companies: Ballet Philippines (BP), which is based at the CCP Main Building, and Philippine Ballet Theatre (PBT), Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company, and the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFC) which are all based outside the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since its founding in 1969, BP has performed over 400 works at the CCP, ranging from full-length classical ballets to modern dance and neo-ethnic pieces, under its founding artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>, later National Artist for Dance, and after her, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2593\"> Cecile Sicangco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2499\"> Noordin Jumalon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\">Alden Lugnasin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2437\">Augustus Damian III</a>, Alan Hineline, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2521\">Max Luna III</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2541\"> Paul Morales</a>.

Gawad Alternatibo annually cites the best efforts of Pinoy filmmakers in four categories: Animation, Experimental, Documentary, and Short Feature. Each winner receives a cash prize and a certificate. Special citations are also awarded to the best work from the regions, as well as works on/for/by children.

Established in 2004, the festival has given birth to some of Philippine cinema&rsquo;s contemporary masterpieces and is regarded as one of the most prestigious independent film competitions in the country, and a much awaited cultural event as well. Some of today&rsquo;s acclaimed filmmakers have launched their careers via the annual festival and competition, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Kanakan Balintagos</a> aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Aureaus Solito</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4428\">Lawrence Fajardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4539\">Chris Martinez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4498\">Jun Robles Lana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5792\">Alvin B.

In recognition of the broad reach and powerful influence of radio and television, the CCP established in 1987 a Coordinating Center for Broadcast Arts which was one of the units of the then Visual, Literary, and Media Arts Department. While all these units have been replaced by the Media Arts Division, the CCP&mdash;then and now&mdash;has continued efforts to equip ordinary citizens with the skills to produce radio programs and videos that reflect their realities and that allow them to promote their sectoral interests through broadcasting. It conducts hands-on training-workshops on radio and television production and scriptwriting, accepts apprenticeships, and awards production grants. While bringing its training program to as far north as Batanes and as far south as Tawi-tawi, the CCP encourages the use of Filipino languages in the programs and videos produced by its trainees. Among those who complete the training programs and are given grants to produce their own radio programs are farmers, fisherfolk, social development and cultural workers, students, and local leaders who produce and host talk shows, historical documentaries, instructional programs, public service announcements, music shows, and dramatizations of Filipino myths and legends. Their productions are aired in cooperation with local radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP produces television programs as well as videos. In 1990 it produced <b><i>Pinoy Eh</i></b>, a magazine show<b><i> </i></b>aired on ABC Channel 5.

In 1990-1998, the Gawad CCP Para sa Radyo (CCP Awards for Radio) was given at the same time as the television awards, to outstanding radio programs, producers, directors, scriptwriters, performers, and music and sound designers.

The CCP through its Cultural Exchange Department also provides local tour grants for regional performing groups. It is also active in giving art therapy workshops&mdash;called <b><i>Kalinga ng Sining</i></b>&mdash;in provincial areas devastated by natural calamities or armed conflicts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP has occasionally engaged in film production.

The first essays on the seven arts were compiled and published in a coffee table book with the same title in 1991.

		"text": "<p><b>Constancio de Guzman&nbsp;</b>(<b>Constancio Canseco de Guzman</b>) was a music composer and film scorer. He was born in Guiguinto, Bulacan on 11 Nov 1903. He died in Manila on 16 Aug 1982. He was the son of Higino de Guzman, a writer in Spanish, and Margarita Canseco. He married Leonor Buensuceso with whom he had six children. He was the grandson of fictionist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, nephew of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> fictionist and poet&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K. Santos</a>, and brother of film director and screenwriter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4376\">Susana de Guzman</a>. During his boyhood, he studied <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/38/835\">composition</a> under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>, but his father sent him to law school. Later he switched to commerce and finished business administration in 1931. After passing the Certified Public Accountancy board examinations, he started working in the movies, together with his sister Susana. He wrote numerous pieces of music for films beginning 1931, becoming one of the earliest, if the not the first, Filipino musical director for the movies. He composed music for the films of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, Royal, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4507\">Lea</a>, National, X&#39;Otic, Excelsior, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4698\">Tagalog Ilang-Ilang</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of de Guzman&rsquo;s compositions, &ldquo;Panaginip&rdquo; (Dream), became a big hit by accident. His father heard Constancio play the song and had it published, thinking it was the composition of a friend. It sold by the thousands, and the father was surprised to learn it was his own son&rsquo;s work. Since then de Guzman has recorded hundreds of songs, principally under Vicor Records and Columbia Records. De Guzman was at one time director of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\">Villar Records</a>. He was also musical director in many music companies in the Philippines and served as a director of Filipino Society of Composers, Arrangers, and Publishers (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3987\">FILSCAP</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of de Guzman&rsquo;s notable compositions are: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">&quot;Bayan Ko&quot;</a>&nbsp;(My Country), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/857\">&quot;Babalik Ka Rin&quot;</a>&nbsp;(You Will Come Back), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1012\">&quot;Ang Tangi Kong Pag-ibig&quot;</a>&nbsp;(My Only Love), &ldquo;Birheng Walang Dambana&rdquo; (Virgin Without a Shrine), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/968\">&quot;Pamaypay ng Maynila&quot;</a>&nbsp;(Manila Fan), &ldquo;Lambingan&rdquo; (Tender Caressing), &ldquo;Ang Pag-ibig Ko&rsquo;y Ikaw&rdquo; (You are My Love), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\">&quot;Maalaala Mo Kaya?&quot;</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>(Will You Remember?). He also composed music for the following movies: <b><i>Arimunding-munding</i></b>, <b><i>Se&ntilde;orita </i></b>(Miss), <b><i><strong>Sarung Banggi</strong> </i></b>(One Night), <b><i>Probinsyana </i></b>(Provincial Lass), <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong></i></b>, <b><i>Roberta</i></b>, and <b><i>Ikaw ang Aking Buhay </i></b>(You Are My Life) where he won the Best Musical Scorer award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> in 1959. He was also named the Best Composer and Lyricist in the 1969 Awit Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the EDSA Revolution of 1986, de Guzman&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; became the symbolic anthem of the Filipino people that represented their sentiments and eagerness to be freed from the Marcos&#39;s&nbsp;dictatorship. This resonated with the earlier purpose for which the song was written, as a hopeful expression of independence from the Americans. The song was incorporated into the restaging of Severino Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><em>sarsuwela</em></a>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></i></b> (No Wounds) in 1970. The Tagalog lyrics were written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>. &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; won for de Guzman the gold medal at the Paris International Fair of 1948, together with his other song, &ldquo;Kung Kita&rsquo;y Kapiling&rdquo; (When I&rsquo;m With You). &ldquo;Bayan Ko&rdquo; has also been used in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1119\"><strong>Bayan Ko: Kapit sa Patalim</strong></a></i></b> (<em><strong>My Country: Gripping the Knife&rsquo;s Edge</strong></em>), 1985; in the TV documentary <b><i>EDSA 25: Sulyap ng Kasaysayan </i></b>(EDSA 25: A Glimpse of History), 2011; and in the movies <b><i>Don&rsquo;t Give Up on Us</i></b>, 2006, <b><i>Pisay</i></b><i>,</i> 2007, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1251\"><strong>Noy</strong></a></i></b>, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His other famous song, &ldquo;Maalala Mo Kaya?&rdquo;, was used by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> for their TV series of the same title, which started in 1991 and is hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\">Charo Santos</a>. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\">Maalaala Mo Kaya</a> </i></b>is considered the longest running drama anthology in the Philippines to date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Guzman also acted for the movies, appearing in <b><i>Huling Dalangin </i></b>(Last Prayer), 1948, and <b><i>Hiyas ng Pamilihan</i></b> (Gem of the Marketplace), 1949. <strong>&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em>Written by Flerida G.

He died on 26 May 1932. He was the second of three children of Vicente de Jesus of Santa Maria, Bulacan, and Susana Pangilinan of Pampanga. His brother Vicente de Jesus Jr was a poet in Spanish. He married Asuncion Lacdan in 1918, with whom he had three children. He grew up in Santa Maria, Bulacan, finished high school at the Liceo de Manila, and took up a law at the Escuela de Derecho. He also studied humanities, Italian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> at the University of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Jesus did not pursue law as a profession and instead became a newspaperman. Beginning 1920, he ran the column &quot;Buhay Maynila&quot; (Manila Life) in the <b><i>Taliba</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>using the pseudonym Huseng Batute. Later, he did a daily column, &quot;Mga Lagot na Bagting ng Kudyapi&quot; (Broken Chords of the Kudyapi), also in <b><i>Taliba</i></b>, and another column, &quot;Mga Butlig ng Panahon&quot; (Wens of Time), 1922, in weekly <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b>. He edited <b><i><strong>Sampaguita</strong></i></b> and together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5178\">Florentino Collantes</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5372\">Amado V. Hernandez</a>, turned it into a magazine of exceptional quality. His columns showed him as a fierce patriot, inveighing against mendicancy to the United States and discrimination against Filipinos, praising the founding of the Bagong Katipunan and student rallies against abusive American teachers, and mounting a crusade to popularize locally made shoes, the barong tagalog, and Philippine songs. He was, however, unsuccessful in politics, failing in both of his attempts to become mayor of Santa Maria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the foremost personalities of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5389\">Ilaw at Panitik</a>, de Jesus was a prominent literary figure among the older generation of writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K. Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5619\">Benigno Ramos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5630\">I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5032\">Rosauro Almario</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5330\">Pedro Gatmaitan</a>. His works&mdash;in style, subject matter, and form&mdash;embodied the flowering of the Filipino literary movement named after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Balagtas</a>, <i>balagtasismo</i>. As early as 1912, one of his poems was published in <b><i>The Reformer</i></b>, bearing the romantic and lyrical style that would become his trademark. His poetry is melodic and poignant. Among his famous poems are &ldquo;Ang Manok Kong Bulik&rdquo; (My Speckled Rooster), 1919; &ldquo;Ang Pagbabalik&rdquo; (The Return), 1924; &ldquo;Ang Pamana&rdquo; (The Legacy), 1925; &ldquo;Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Love), 1926; &ldquo;Manggagawa&rdquo; (Worker), 1929; and &ldquo;Isang Punongkahoy&rdquo; (A Tree), 1932. He contributed poems to <b><i>Taliba</i></b>,<b><i> Ang Mithi</i></b>,<b><i> Bagong Lipang <strong>Kala</strong>baw</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Sampaguita</i></b>. His poetry collection <b><i>Mga Dahong Ginto </i></b>(Golden Leaves) was published in 1920.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A colorful figure, he became Hari ng Balagtasan. The <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\">balagtasan</a></em> was a poetic joust. De Jesus often won against his foremost opponent, Florentino Collantes. He and Collantes clashed on the topics &ldquo;Paruparo at Bubuyog&rdquo; (Butterfly and Bee), &ldquo;Bakal at Ginto&rdquo; (Steel and Gold), and, most famous of all, &ldquo;Ang Dalaga Kahapon at ang Dalaga Ngayon (The Maiden of Yesterday and the Maiden of Today). He also debated with Pedro Gatmaitan on &ldquo;Guro at Nars&rdquo; (Teacher and Nurse), and later on &ldquo;Espa&ntilde;a at Amerika&rdquo; (Spain and America). He and Amado V. Hernandez also did a balagtasan<i> </i>in print. Due in part to de Jesus, balagtasan became so popular that in 1934, <b><i>Balagtasan on the Air</i></b> began airing on KZRH. De Jesus had already died by then so Collantes became the program&rsquo;s primary <b>mambabalagtas</b>, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5045\">Emilio Mar. Antonio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5422\">Jose Domingo Karasig</a>, Epifania Alvarez, and other mambabalagtas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Jesus composed lyrics for songs, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3958\">Constancio de Guzman</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\">&quot;Bayan Ko&quot;</a>&nbsp;(My Country), Gregorio Pablo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Maawa Ka&rdquo; (Have Pity), Lorenzo Fajardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Una Kong Pag-ibig&rdquo; (My First Love), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Masayang Dalaga&rdquo; (Happy Maiden) and &ldquo;Bakit Ka Lumuluha?&rdquo; (Why Are You Weeping?), Miguel Trinidad&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Lambing Mo&rdquo; (You Are So Loving), Gerardo Enriquez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pusong Wasak&rdquo; (Broken Heart), C. Ortanez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Luha ni Juan de la Cruz&rdquo; (Tears of Juan de la Cruz), Luis del Barrio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pananalig sa Pilipinas&rdquo; (Faith in the Philippines) and &ldquo;Kalayaan&rdquo; (Freedom), Crispino Reyes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Arimundingmunding,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a>&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\">&quot;Pakiusap&quot;</a>&nbsp;(Plea), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/918\">&ldquo;Kundiman ng Luha&rdquo;</a> (Love Song of Tears).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His strong patriotism and social consciousness emerge in his literary works. His narrative poem, <b><i>Sa Dakong Silangan</i></b> (In the East), 1928, is a nationalist allegory that denounces American imperialist interests. In &ldquo;Ang mga Itinapon ng Kapalaran&rdquo; (Discarded by Fate), 1920, and &ldquo;Maruming Basahan&rdquo; (Dirty Rag), 1931, he touched on social problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wrote scripts for and acted in movies like <b><i>Oriental Blood</i></b>, 1930, and <b><i>Sa Pinto ng Langit</i></b> (Heaven&rsquo;s Door), 1931. He also acted in stage plays like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3152\">Cirio A.

		"text": "<p><strong>Katy de la Cruz</strong> (<strong>Catalina Mangahas&nbsp;</strong><strong>de la Cruz</strong>) was a stage and film actor, and singer. She was born in Intramuros, Manila on 13 Feb 1907. She died on 10 Nov 2004. She was the daughter of Juan de la Cruz and Infanta Mangahas. She married Jose Yoingco. She dropped out of school after the first grade and concentrated on singing&mdash;for anybody, anywhere. She sang between fights at the cockpit, and with brass bands during fiestas for patron saints. At one of these fiestas, theater owner Henry Brown heard her and whisked her away to start a singing career at the age of seven. Her first contract called for singing between movie intermissions, for a starting salary of three pesos a week for three nights. Ambitious, she realized that she would have to stop being the &ldquo;Sophie Tucker of the Philippines&rdquo; and develop her own singing style. At the age of 13, she was well on her way to becoming the &ldquo;Queen of <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">Bodabil</a></em>,&rdquo; a title that no one has challenged. As torch singer, she is best remembered for her naughty renditions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/863\">&quot;Balut&quot;</a>&nbsp;(Duck&rsquo;s Egg), &ldquo;Saging ni Pacing&rdquo; (Pacing&rsquo;s Banana), and &ldquo;A Tear Fell.&rdquo; She continued to perform for many years in the United States where she later resided with her family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She performed with the stars of the period: Diana Toy, Hanasan, Dimples, and the &ldquo;Queen of <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">Kundiman</a></em>&rdquo; herself, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang<strong>&nbsp;</strong>de la Rama</a>. Later, de la Cruz began singing on her own at the Savoy, Palace, and Lux movie houses, with chorus girls who became movie stars, such as Patsy, Chuchi, Etang Discher, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4251\">Rosa Aguirre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\">Chichay</a>, the Custodio Sisters, and Mary Walter. At 18, she was the highest paid star, earning 150 pesos at the Savoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1957, she went on a Southeast Asian tour. She also sang in the Pacific region, the United States, Hong Kong, China, and Australia. In 1961, she starred in a Las Vegas show that cast 75 Filipinos, receiving many curtain calls for every performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De la Cruz&rsquo;s biography appears in Walter Robb&rsquo;s <strong><em>Filipino</em></strong>, 1941, in recognition of her achievements in the entertainment world. She was declared by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> as Best Supporting Actress for <strong><em>Inspirasyon</em></strong> (Inspiration) in 1953 and was named one of the 10 Most Outstanding Women of the Year in 1961. She was conferred the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador</a> Memorial Award by the FAMAS in 1973 and the Tandang Sora Award in 1975. In 1989, de la Cruz returned to Manila to witness <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/581\"><strong><em>Katy! The <strong>Musical</strong></em></strong></a>, a musical on her life, with libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a> and music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a> and starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4210\">Mitch Valdes</a> in the title role. &nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Malou L.

At the age of seven, she started playing child roles in such Spanish <strong>zarzuela</strong> as <strong><em>La <strong>Mascota</strong></em></strong> (The Mascot), <strong><em>Sue&ntilde;o de un&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Vals</em></strong> (Dream Waltz), <strong><em>Marina</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Viuda Alegre</em></strong> (Merry Widow).

But it was singing that came to her naturally, so she took voice lessons with Victorino Carrion and Galia Arellano. At the age of 14, she played Angelita in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong><em>Dalagang Bukid</em></strong></a> (Country Maiden), 1917, which Ignacio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> had written for her. This made her a star. The show had some 1,000 performances before 1940 and was made into a movie, the first Tagalog full-length feature film, also starring de la Rama, in 1919. She completed a pharmacy course at the Centro Escolar de Se&ntilde;oritas (now Centro Escolar University) in 1922 and took courses at the Royal Dramatic Theater Academy in New York in 1925.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After <strong><em><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></em></strong> and the song &ldquo;Nabasag ang Banga&rdquo; (The Claypot Broke), which she made a hit, de la Rama was in great demand as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> lead in the productions of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3235\">Compa&ntilde;ia Zarzuela Ilagan</a>, Samahang Paguia of Tondo, Samahang Gabriel of Santa Cruz, Samahang Antonio Sempio of Bulacan, and Samahang Sarsuela Ballecer.

He ran for president in 1961&mdash;at the same time releasing <b><i>Dugo at <strong>Luha</strong></i></b><i> </i>(Blood and Tears), which highlighted the government&rsquo;s neglect for the poor&mdash;but backed out at the last minute and supported Diosdado Macapagal who won over <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\">Carlos P. Garcia</a>. Retiring from movies, he occupied a series of ambassadorial posts: Sri Lanka in 1963; Cambodia in 1965; and The Hague, Netherlands, up to 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De la Rosa received Best Actor award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> for <b><i>Higit sa Lahat</i></b>, 1955, two years after he was nominated by the FAMAS for <b><i>Sa Paanan ng Bundok</i></b><i> </i>(At the Foot of the Mountain), 1953.

Datu Paglas, Maguindanao 30 Dec 1958. Filmmaker. His father, Mario Vigilia Diaz, is from Guimba, Nueva Ecija; his mother, Maria Indico, is from Lambunao, Iloilo. Both parents were teachers who volunteered to resettle as pioneer educators in Mindanao. Diaz received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in economics at Notre Dame University in Cotabato City, 1979. He married Minda Pongos with whom he has three children: Lara, Paolo, and Sultan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, Diaz first found work writing scripts for the weekly TV drama anthology <b><i>Balintataw </i></b>and the children&rsquo;s show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a>bot</i></b>. He also worked as a tabloid journalist for <b><i>People&rsquo;s Journal</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Taliba</i></b> while writing short stories, two of which won prizes at the 1990 and 1991 Don <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\"><strong>Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At a filmmaking workshop in Mowelfund, Diaz directed his short film <b><i>Banlaw</i> </b>(Cleansing), 1986, about an idealist who, unable to bear the weight of the world&rsquo;s sufferings, commits suicide. An invitation for his video documentary about Manila&rsquo;s street children to be part of a touring multimedia show brought Diaz to New York City. It was here that he discovered a number of his cinematic idols, like Andrei Tarkovsky whose themes reverberate through his works. Diaz eventually moved his family to New York, yet the Philippines remained his principal muse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first time that Diaz returned to Manila was occasioned by an offer from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\"><strong>Regal Films</strong></a> producer Lily Monteverde to write and direct films for her ultra-low-budget productions. He managed to produce two classic films: <b><i>Serafin Geronimo: Ang Kriminal ng Barrio Concepcion</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>The Criminal of Barrio Concepcion</i></b>), 1998, a drama inspired by Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s <b><i>Crime and Punishment</i></b> about a man who gets involved in a deadly crime then falls into a pit of remorse, and <b><i>Hubad sa Ilalim ng Buwan</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Naked under the Moon</i></b>), 1999, a metaphysical sex drama about a lapsed priest and his family grappling with carnal agonies and spiritual crises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Diaz took a quantum leap forward with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1117\"><strong>Batang West Side</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>West <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"><strong>Side A</strong></a>venue</i></b>), 2002, the first of his full-length films to be produced outside the studio system. With a screening time of almost five hours, it was also the first of his films that gave free rein to his belief in letting material and artistic vision determine the running time. The film follows the investigation of the death of a young Filipino immigrant in Jersey City and exposes along the way the psychological fractures of the Filipino diaspora struggling with displacement and the savage legacy of Marcos&rsquo;s martial law. <b><i>Batang West Side</i></b> won a record-breaking 10 Gawad Urian including Best Picture and garnered the first of Diaz&rsquo;s many awards at the international film festivals in Singapore and Brussels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After a detour with a studio-produced film, <b><i>Hesus, Rebolusyonaryo</i></b><i> </i>(Hesus the Revolutionary), 2003, a dystopian reflection on the martial law period, Diaz presented another independently produced film, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1157\"><strong>Ebolusyon ng Isang Pamilyang Pilipino</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Evolution of a Filipino Family</i></b>), 2004. Relating the lives of a family of farmers and another family of miners during the martial law years, <b><i>Ebolusyon</i></b> had taken almost eleven years to make and displayed a further unfolding of Diaz&rsquo;s filmmaking philosophy, one that eschewed emotional manipulation for the sake of a more organic presentation of the material, as expressed in unmoving camera shots, black-and-white cinematography, and paucity if not total absence of music scoring, close-ups, quick cuts, and other tricks that Hollywood-influenced films are prone to use with push-button abandon. <b><i>Ebolusyon</i></b><i> </i>won Best Picture at the Gawad Urian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Diaz&rsquo;s long-form films eventually attracted an increasing following among cinephiles in the international film festival circuit. <b><i>Heremias: Unang Aklat</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Heremias: Book <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a></i></b>), 2006, nine hours, about the travails of an itinerant rural merchant discovering the evils of the world, garnered a Special Jury Prize in Fribourg. His next film,<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1201\"><strong>Kagadanan sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/864\"><strong>Banwa</strong></a>an ning mga Engkanto</strong></a></b> </i>(<b><i>Death in the Land of Encantos</i></b>), 2007, nine hours, is a tour de force incorporating documentary video of the ravages of Typhoon Reming and the fictional story of a trio of friends trying to find meaning and grace in the typhoon&rsquo;s wake. The Venice International Film Festival selected the film to close its Orizzonti section where it garnered a Special Jury Mention. <b><i>Melancholia</i></b>, 2008, eight hours, about a triad of friends grappling with the disappearance of loved ones in their fight against fascism, also premiered as the closing night selection of the Orizzonti section and received the Grand Jury Prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The next years saw Diaz working on shorter films, like <b><i>Walang Alaala ang mga</i></b><i> <b>Paruparo</b></i> (<b><i>Butterflies Have No Memories</i></b>), 2009, one hour, set in a former mining town adrift in physical and spiritual decay, and <b><i>Elehiya sa Dumalaw mula sa Himagsikan</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Elegy to the Visitor from the Revolution</i></b>), 2011, 80 minutes, the story of the visit by a woman from the 19th-century anti-Spanish revolution among present-day urban dwellers languishing in a world of lost ideals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Siglo ng Pagluluwal</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Century of Birthing</i></b>), 2011, six hours, reflects Diaz&rsquo;s attempt to find artistic regeneration during a period of aborted film projects and artistic doubts. <b><i>Siglo</i> </b>follows the struggles of a filmmaker hounded by various characters to get his next opus finished. <b><i>Siglo</i></b> incorporates footage from one of Diaz&rsquo;s unfinished film projects, and so does his next film <b><i>Florentina Hubaldo, CTE</i></b>, 2012, six hours,<i> </i>the story of a young rural woman suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease suffered by those whose heads have been subjected to repeated beating, a condition meant as a metaphor of the national psyche after repeated assaults by colonizers and oppressors through its arduous history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">If Diaz had been struggling for artistic rebirth, then his film<i> <b>Norte, Hangganan ng Kasaysayan</b> </i>(<b><i>Norte, The End of History</i></b>), 2013, four hours, confirmed it in spades. The film turned out to be his most internationally acclaimed and commercially successful work to date. Inspired by Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s <b><i>Crime and Punishment</i></b>, it follows the struggles for redemption by a man who is wrongly jailed for a crime and by the real murderer who roams free (a brilliant but twisted character inspired, according to Diaz, by the young Marcos). It was the first of Diaz&rsquo;s films in some dozen years to be released commercially in the Philippines, when it played to sold-out houses during its extended limited runs. The film premiered as an official selection at Cannes and subsequently became his most invited film in the international film festival circuit. It was named one of the year&rsquo;s 10 best films in the annual British Film Institute/<b><i>Sight &amp; Sound</i></b><i> </i>international critics&rsquo; poll. It won several awards both at home and abroad, including the Gawad Urian for Best Picture. <b><i>Norte</i></b> led to major <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4407\"><strong>Lav Diaz</strong></a> retrospectives in Sao Paulo and at New York&rsquo;s Lincoln Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Diaz followed up with <b><i>Prologo sa Ang Dakilang Desaparecido</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Prologue to the Great Desaparecido</i></b>), 2013, 31 minutes,<i> </i>relating the search by Gregoria de Jesus for the slain body of her husband, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a>, and the death of Bonifacio&rsquo;s faithful general, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5393\"><strong>Emilio Jacinto</strong></a>. Diaz drew on childhood memories for <b><i>Mula sa Kung Ano ang Noon</i></b> (<b><i>From What Is Before</i></b>), 2014, four and a half hours, set in a remote hamlet on the eve of the declaration of martial law. The film tells the story of how the villagers&rsquo; individual and collective weaknesses and superstitions are exacerbated by the arrival of outsiders, a military officer and a peddler of panaceas. It debuted at the World Premieres Film Festival in Manila where it garnered the Grand Festival Prize. It also won the Golden Leopard at the 2014 Locarno International Film Festival, as well as the Best Film award at Gawad Urian in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2016, two of his films were recognized internationally. <b><i>Hele sa Hiwagang Hapis</i></b> (<b><i>A Lullaby to the Sorrowful Mystery</i></b>), 2016, eight hours and five minutes, which explores the role of Andres Bonifacio in the Philippine Revolution of 1896, won the Silver Bear Alfred Bauer Prize at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. <b><i>Ang Babaeng Humayo</i></b> (<b><i>The Woman Who Left</i></b>), 2016, three hours and forty-six minutes, about a former schoolteacher, imprisoned for three decades, who plots revenge against her ex-boyfriend who framed her, won the Golden Lion at the 73rd Venice International Film Festival. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Gil Quito</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Quezon City 30 Mar 1955. d. Taguig City, Metro Manila 8 Oct 2012. Director and writer for film and television. She grew up in Quezon City, one of the seven children of affluent lawyers Conrado Diaz and Felicitas Correa. She graduated with a bachelor of arts in communication arts from Assumption Convent, 1976; master of arts in film and television from Loyola Marymount University (Los Angeles), 1978; and a diploma in film from the London International Film School, 1978. She married <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4240\"><strong>Manolo Abaya</strong></a> who would work as the cinematographer for some of the most celebrated films of the first half of her career. They have two sons: Marc, an actor/singer, and David, a cinematographer. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">After finishing their film courses in London, the Abayas convinced their parents to finance their first film, a gothic mystery set in the 1930s, <b><i>Tanikala</i></b> (Chains), 1980, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\"><strong>Susan Roces</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4723\"><strong>Romeo Vasquez</strong></a>. The movie flopped in the tills but its assured storytelling caught the eye of independent film producer Jesse Ejercito who offered to bankroll their next film.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">While developing the story of what would eventually become the film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1130\"><strong>Brutal</strong></a></i></b>, 1980, Diaz-Abaya proposed Ricky Lee, whom she had never met but only heard of, to write the screenplay. Lee would eventually write or co-write half of Diaz-Abaya&rsquo;s career output of twenty full-length feature films. Their collaboration would include some of the most famous works in Diaz-Abaya&rsquo;s filmography, including <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a></i></b>, 1982; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1204\"><strong>Karnal</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Of the Flesh</i></b>), 1983; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1998; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1242\"><strong>Muro-ami</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Reef Hunters</i></b>), 1999.<b> </b></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Diaz-Abaya&rsquo;s breakthrough came with <b><i>Brutal</i></b>, about an abused woman who kills her husband during a drug binge, with a structure that went back and forth in time. It was a box-office and critical success and won Best Director at the Metro Manila Film Festival.<b><i> </i></b>It was the first of what would come to be known as Diaz-Abaya and Lee&rsquo;s &ldquo;feminist trilogy,&rdquo; films that sought to explore and protest the pernicious burdens set on women by society. Next in the trilogy was <b><i>Moral</i></b>, a complex story of four female classmates from the University of the Philippines negotiating the shifting social, political, and moral values of the country during the martial law years. The British Film Institute named it Outstanding Film of the Year. This was followed by <b><i>Karnal</i></b>, set in the 1930s, about a woman whose move from the city to the patriarchal hacienda milieu of her husband and father-in-law precipitates a tragic chain of events. The film exposes the violence wrought by the male chauvinism and despotism that continue to underlie Philippine society. It received Best Picture awards from the Metro Manila Film Festival and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\"><strong>Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</strong></a>, and the Gawad Urian named it one of the 10 Best Films of the Decade 1980-89. Another notable film she did in this decade was <b><i>Senswal </i></b>(Sensual), 1986. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">After the fall of martial law, Diaz-Abaya took a respite from filmmaking, directing public affairs TV shows: <b><i>Public Forum</i></b>,<i> </i>featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4800\"><strong>Randy David</strong></a>; <b><i>Sic O&rsquo;Clock News</i></b>;<i> <b>The Big Story</b></i>;<i> </i>and <b><i>Pinoy Eh!</i></b>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">She made her comeback to film in 1993 with <b><i>Kung Ako&rsquo;y Iiwan Mo</i></b><i> </i>(If You Should Leave Me), depicting the breakup of a marriage. She followed up with the female advocacy films <b><i>Ang Ika-11 Utos</i></b> (The Eleventh Commandment), 1994, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1449\"><strong>Ipaglaban Mo</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Redeem Her Honor</i></b>), 1995, commercially successful films that somehow lacked the rigor and freshness of her earlier feminist films. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Diaz-Abaya tried to break out of her customary social feminist mold with <b><i>May Nagmamahal sa Iyo</i></b> (<b><i>Madonna and Child</i></b>), 1996. In its story of a woman&rsquo;s search for a child she had given up for adoption, its concerns were not about victimization but something more basic about woman&rsquo;s nature, that of motherhood. Diaz-Abaya eventually broke loose with the enigmatic <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a></i></b>, 1997, written by Rolando Tinio and dedicated to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\"><strong>Ishmael Bernal</strong></a> (both of whom she spoke of as her chief mentors), about a woman who, sleeping with all four men of a family, somehow retains an innocence at her core. The film finds Diaz-Abaya exploring a woman&rsquo;s struggle for spiritual fulfillment rather than freedom from societal oppression. It won an unprecedented 10 trophies at the Gawad Urian, which eventually named it one of the best films of the decade. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Wishing to shake off her image as director of women&rsquo;s films and using flourishes of magic realism, Diaz-Abaya followed up with <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1282\"><strong>Sa Pusod ng Dagat</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>In the Navel of the Sea</i></b>), 1998, which centers on the memories of a young man growing up in a fishing community in the 1950s. The film garnered the International Federation of Film Critics / Network for the Promotion of Cinema Award at Singapore International Film Festival and opened the major Philippine film retrospective at New York&rsquo;s Lincoln Center in 1998. Despite the film&rsquo;s poor showing at the tills, its producer, GMA Films, asked Diaz-Abaya to direct a big-budget biography of the national hero, <b><i>Jose Rizal</i></b>, where she cast <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4550\"><strong>Cesar Montano</strong></a> in the titular role. The epic period film would cost 80 million pesos, the most expensive Philippine film at the time. Somehow weighed down by heavy-handed depiction of the Spanish friars and overly overt polemics, there was no denying the film&rsquo;s ambitions and technical achievements. It won numerous awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, at the Metro Manila Film Festival and FAMAS, and was named one of Gawad Urian&rsquo;s best films of the decade.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Diaz-Abaya explored environmental and social themes in <b><i>Muro-ami</i></b> in its story of a man (Cesar Montano) exploiting children in the illegal practice of reef hunting. It became another of Diaz-Abaya&rsquo;s box-office and critical successes, winning Best Picture and Best Director at the Metro Manila Film Festival and FAMAS Awards. Montano once again starred in Diaz-Abaya&rsquo;s next film, <b><i>Bagong Buwan</i></b> (<b><i>New Moon</i></b>), 2001, as a Muslim medical doctor caught in the war in Mindanao. Marred by a sense of forced plotting that sometimes weighed down her advocacy films, it nevertheless continued Diaz-Abaya&rsquo;s streak of box-office successes coupled with wins for Best Picture and Best Director at the FAMAS Awards.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">At about this time, Diaz-Abaya became more religious, volunteering as media specialist for the Silsilah <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2263\"><strong>Peace</strong></a> Institute, which espoused interfaith dialogue between Christians and Muslims, as well as the Jesuit Communications Foundation. Her religious faith became an anchor after she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007, the struggle with which she communicated with candor in public interviews. Her last films were an extension of her advocacy and preoccupation with faith. <b><i>Maging Akin Muli</i></b> (Be Mine Again), 2005, is a paean to the rituals of the Catholic Church. Its story of a young apprentice priest is one of the most directly affecting of her films. She struggled through illness to finish <b><i>Ikaw ang Pag-ibig</i></b> (You Are Love), 2011, and the strain somehow showed in a rather diffuse telling of a story about a family tested by cancer and eventually coming together in faith. In the same year, she filmed <b><i>Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow</i></b>, a movie that explores the lives of a family and their complex love affairs. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Needing to lighten her film directing activities, she established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\"><strong>Marilou Diaz-Abaya</strong></a> Film Institute and Arts Center, 2007, to train aspiring filmmakers. She received the Fukuoka Prize for Culture and the Arts, Japan, 2001. She reminisced about her career and filmmaking philosophy in the documentary <b><i>Marilou Diaz-Abaya: Filmmaker on a Voyage</i></b>, 2012. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Gil Quito</strong> </em></span></p>\r\n"

Hong Kong 13 Aug 1911. d. Florida, USA 4 May 1991. Movie director and scriptwriter. His father, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\"><strong>Jose Estella</strong></a>, was known for his waltz compositions and called the &ldquo;Filipino Johann Strauss,&rdquo; and his aunt, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4712\"><strong>Maria Tronqued</strong></a>, was a leading actor in the silent movies. He was educated at San Beda College and studied medicine at the University of Santo Tomas. In the 1920s, he became a radio star, singing Spanish songs on the air. Away from the Philippines since 1965, he lived in semiretirement in Florida, USA, with his Japanese wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Estella began his film career in the 1930s, when movies and radio had replaced the <i>sarsuwela </i>as the most popular cultural forms. His first movie assignment was in the first Filipino &ldquo;talkie,&rdquo; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1270\"><strong>Punyal na Ginto</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Golden Dagger), 1933, where he sang and made a guest appearance. He also wrote a few stories, particularly for director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\"><strong>Carlos Vander Tolosa</strong></a>. By the 1950s, he had become one of the top-ranking directors of Philippine movies, together with Gerardo de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\"><strong>Lamberto V. Avellana</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\"><strong>Manuel Conde</strong></a>&mdash;the four &ldquo;wonder boys&rdquo; who brought Philippine cinema to international prominence during that period. In a career that spanned 40 years, he made a total of 79 full-length feature films, 50 documentary shorts and features, and 50 TV commercials. Unfortunately, most of his films, including the most important ones, have been lost or are difficult to locate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Estella directed his first film, <b><i>Bayan at Pag-ibig</i></b><i> </i>(Country and Love), 1938, for Excelsior Pictures. Moving to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\"><strong>Filippine Films</strong></a>, he made the movies that established him as a director of great promise. Two of them, <b><i>Huling Habilin</i></b><i> </i>(Last Will), 1940, and <b><i>Buenavista</i></b>,<i> </i>1940, were considered by the late art critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5006\"><strong>T. D. Agcaoili</strong></a> as two of the finest local pictures ever made. He also made <b><i>Ang Tagala</i></b><i> </i>(The Tagalog Woman), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Love Song), <b><i>Singsing na Pangkasal</i></b> (Wedding Ring), <b><i>Paraiso</i></b> (Paradise), and <b><i>Ilang-Ilang</i></b>, 1941. After World War II, he directed a succession of films: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4989\"><strong>Voice of Freedom</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1946, which tackled guerrilla life during the Japanese Occupation; <b><i>Tagumpay</i></b><i> </i>(Victory), 1946, a love story set during the war; <b><i>Magkaibang</i></b><i> <b>Lahi</b> </i>(Different Races), 1947, the story of a Filipina who, after marriage to an American soldier and life in America, realizes that there is no place like home; <b><i>Labi ng Bataan</i></b> (Bataan Survivors), 1948, the story of those who miraculously survived the infamous Death March in 1941; and <b><i>Ako Raw ay Huk</i></b><i> </i>(They Call Me Rebel), 1948, a violent tour de force,<i> </i>which was heavily censored and whose title was altered. He also wrote and directed <b><i>Angelus</i></b>,<i> </i>1946, the movie version of the stage play <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/854\"><strong>Ave Maria</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>about a man who sold his soul to the devil. Other memorable films he did are <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1950, based on the popular <i>komiks </i>serial, and <b><i>Sundalong Talahib </i></b>(Grass Soldier), 1950, a story of the Hukbalahap movement. Other films he did after the war include <b><i>Caprichosa </i>(</b>Lady of Whims), 1947; <b><i>Anghel sa Lupa</i></b> (Angel on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a>), <b><i>Perfidia</i></b>, and <b><i>Hiram na Pangalan</i></b> (Borrowed Name), 1948; <b><i>Liham ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a></i></b> (Hero&rsquo;s Letter), <b><i>Kay Ganda ng Umaga</i></b> (How Beautiful Is the Morning), and <b><i>Dugo ng Katipunan</i></b> (Katipunan Blood), 1949; <b><i>Punglo at Pag-ibig</i></b> (Bullet and Love), <b><i>Bandido </i></b>(Bandit), and <b><i>Prinsipe Don Juan</i></b> (Prince Don Juan), 1950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">In the 1950s Estella left for New York where he took up film and television courses and learned from prominent American directors like Fred Zinnemann and Robert Flaherty. He worked for the United Nations Secretariat as officer in charge of documentary films, newsreels, and TV shows&mdash;a job that brought him to parts of Latin America and Indochina. In 1955, he directed a full-length film, <b><i>Twins</i></b>,<i> </i>in Vietnam, a joint production between the United States Information Service and Thet Productions, Saigon. Returning to the Philippines in 1955, he completed two ambitious projects. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> was <b><i>Desperado</i></b><i> </i>(Desperate), 1956, a Philippine version of the Wild West, which director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a> described as &ldquo;an exciting example of a B-movie.&rdquo; The other one was <b><i>Buhay at Pag-ibig ni Dr. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Life and Loves of Dr Jose Rizal), 1956, a three-hour, slow-paced film that depicted major events in the patriot&rsquo;s life. He also directed <b><i>Sta. Rita de Casia</i></b> and <b><i>Ramir</i></b>, 1958. Later, he directed films abroad, including <b><i>Kim</i></b>,<i> </i>1957, a co-production of Thet Productions of Vietnam and Cirio Santiago Film Organization, and a couple of movies for Malay Films of the Shaw Brothers, Maria Menado Productions, and Cathay Keris, such as <b><i>Kembali Saorang</i></b> (<b><i>One Came Back</i></b>), 1957; <b><i>Mata Hari</i></b> (<b><i>The Rape of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a></i></b>), 1958; <b><i>Samseng</i></b> (<b><i>Gangster</i></b>), 1959; <b><i>Darah-Ku</i></b> (<b><i>My Blood</i></b>), 1963; <b><i>Pontianak Kembali</i></b> (<b><i>The Pontianak Returns</i></b>), 1964; and <b><i>Pusaka Pontianak</i></b> (<b><i>The Accursed Heritage</i></b>), 1965. Estella also did a number of movies set in Japan, such as <b><i>Tokyo Calling</i></b>,<i> </i>1971, and <b><i>Pedro Goes to Tokyo</i></b>,<i> </i>1961, which sought to promote brotherhood and cooperation among Asians. In New York, he produced and directed shorts for Charles Hans Film Productions.

He won Best Director from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\"><strong>Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</strong></a> for <b><i>Desperado</i></b>, which<b> </b>also won the FAMAS awards for Best Picture and Best Editing. <b><i>Samseng</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Mata Hari</i></b><i> </i>won awards in Malaya-Singapore.

It was the most popular Filipino film award from 1952 to 1982, as well as the sole award-giving body in the country from 1952 to 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Originally patterned after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood, which gives out annual &ldquo;Oscar&rdquo; awards, it had a Board of Regents composed of four representatives of the then major studios (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a>, LVN, Premiere, Lebran) and four representatives of the independent movie producers: Everlasting Pictures, EddieRomero Productions, Deegar Cinema Films, and RoyalProductions. Movie Press Club representatives composed the majority membership. Elections were held yearly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The name &ldquo;FAMAS&rdquo; was suggested by movie actor (later Manila councilor) Jaime delaRosa whose resolution was adopted by the body at a meeting held on 31 May 1953 at Far Eastern University in Manila. At this meeting the following were elected as the first set of officers: Flavio G. Macaso, president; Vicente R. Generoso, vice president; Delfin Ferrer Gamboa, secretary; Lynn Strait, treasurer; and Vivencio R. Isaac, public relations officer. The Board of Regents was composed of Julio EstebanAnguita (Lebran), GerardodeLeon (Premiere), FredMontilla (Sampaguita), RosaRosal (LVN), and the representatives of the independent movie producers: BenPerez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\"><strong>Eddie Romero</strong></a>, AristonAvelino, and Pedro Santos. The FAMAS suffered a crisis in 1960 when SampaguitaPictures and Vera Perez Productions withdrew their studio representation and returned all 33 trophies they had won since 1952. The other affiliated film companies similarly withdrew representation in the FAMAS although they did not return their trophies. As a result, the FAMAS was left with only a handful of magazine editors, movie columnists, and writers, including Alfredo Mu&ntilde;oz, Vic Generoso, Gemiliano Pineda, Lilia Rianzares, Letty Martillo, Mario Mijares Lopez, and Nazario D. Bas. They kept the organization from dying a natural death. The rift with Sampaguita and Vera Perez was resolved after a &ldquo;Return-over Dinner&rdquo; held during the term of FAMAS president Ramon Lopez. However, since 1961, membership has ceased to be by studio representation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The annual FAMAS Awards was usually held sometime in May or June yearly to honor the previous year&rsquo;s outstanding achievements in film production, such as best picture, director, story, screenplay, actor, actress, supporting actor, supporting actress, child performer, cinematography, production design, music, editing, sound, visual effects, and documentary film. Selection is made by a panel of jurors composed of FAMAS members. In the first FAMAS Awards in 1952, the following films won awards: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1284\"><strong>Sawa sa Lumang Simboryo</strong></a> </i></b>(Python in the Old Dome), Best Picture and Best Cinematography for Emmanuel Rojas; <b><i>Bagong Umaga </i></b>(New Morning), Best Director for Gerardo de Leon and Best Actor for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4594\"><strong>Ben Perez</strong></a>; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1132\"><strong>Buhay Alamang</strong></a></i></b> (Easy Come, Easy Go), Best Screenplay for Eddie Romero and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4261\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4263\"><strong>Cesar Amigo</strong></a></strong></a>; <b><i>Basahang Ginto </i></b>(Golden Rug), Best Actress for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4729\"><strong>Alicia Vergel</strong></a>; <b><i>Korea</i></b>, Best Supporting Actor for Gil de<b><i> </i></b>Leon and Best Supporting Actress for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\"><strong>Nida Blanca</strong></a>; and <b><i>Kalbaryo ni Hesus </i></b>(The Calvary of Jesus), Best Sound Engineering for Charles Gray and Best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Score for Julio Esteban Anguita.

Earlier trophies were cast in bronze by Leonides Valdez; later trophies were patterned after a sculpture etched in wood by A. C. Florentino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Winners of five or more awards in a single category are elevated to the FAMAS Hall of Fame.

Harris and Edward Tait. Since Philippine corporation laws required Filipino participation in any business corporation, Harris and Tait drafted Dr Felix Paterno, Francisco Santamaria, and Guillermo Tiomico as incorporators. The Silos brothers Manuel, Octavio, Cesar, and Augusto were the studio&rsquo;s first film hands. Manuel had gained a reputation as writer and director of some notable silent pictures and as the funnyman Sano, the other half of the Monang and Sano <i>bodabil </i>team. Octavio worked in the laboratory devising trick shots and supervised the preparation of costumes, props, and sets. The other brothers, Cesar and Augusto, were adept at the camera. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; Smith, an American, worked in sound technology. He and the Silos brothers became the &ldquo;4 plus 1&rdquo; team at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\"><strong>Filippine Films</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">During the 1930s the studio made one movie after another, the most successful of which was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Fury in Paradise</i></b>),<i> </i>1937, which starred Rosa del Rosario and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a> Sr and which became a hit in the United States. Billed as an exotic South Sea Island movie, it was still being shown in New York up to the 1950s. Aside from the Silos brothers, other directors who worked at the studio were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\"><strong>Carlos Vander Tolosa</strong></a>, Agapito Conchu, and Eduardo de Castro, the production manager and director of <b><i>Zamboanga</i></b>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">When Harris and Tait decided to reside permanently in the United States, they sold all their shares in the company to a group of sugar landowners from the Visayas, the Aranetas. Under J. Amado Araneta and Placido Mapa, the company installed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\"><strong>Carlos P. Romulo</strong></a>, publisher and chief executive of the DMHM publications, as president. The new administration recruited new talents, among them Nick Osme&ntilde;a, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\"><strong>Lamberto V. Avellana</strong></a>, Hermenegildo Atienza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\"><strong>Ramon Estella</strong></a>, and Enrique Davila. Osme&ntilde;a&rsquo;s only movie, <b><i>Magdalena</i></b>,<i> </i>1941, was acclaimed as an art film and won for its star, Yolanda Marquez, a Best Actress award from a group of journalists. Atienza also made one picture, <b><i>Hating Gabi </i></b>(Midnight), 1940, before he joined city politics. Davila directed a film version of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>&rsquo;s <i>sarsuwela <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a> </b></i>(No Wounds), 1939, which starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a> and Rosa del Rosario. The two directors who later became prominent in the industry made some of the company&rsquo;s most memorable films. Estella directed <b><i>Buenavista</i></b>,<i> </i>1940, a movie about land conflict in the Buenavista Estate, and <b><i>Huling Habilin </i></b>(Last Will), 1940, an unforgettable love story starring Salcedo and del Rosario. Avellana&rsquo;s debut film, <b><i>Sakay</i></b>,<i> </i>1939, starring Salcedo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4445\"><strong>Arsenia Francisco</strong></a>, and Salvador Zaragosa in the title role, launched his brilliant career in film. Filippine Films closed down when World War II broke out. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Mauro Tumbocon Jr</strong> </em></span></p>\r\n"

Initially, the academy consisted of creative and technical guilds representing motion picture producers, distributors, directors, actors, scriptwriters, editors, cinematographers, sound technicians, music directors, production designers, assistant directors, and production managers. These were the Movie Workers Welfare Foundation (Mowelfund); PhilippineMotionPictureProducersAssociation; Integrated Movie Producers, Importers and Distributors Association of the Philippines; Kapisanan ng mga Direktor ng Pelikulang Pilipino; Katipunan ng mga Artista sa Pelikulang Pilipino; Screenwriters Guild of the Philippines; Production Designers Guild of the Philippines; Filipino Society of Cinematographers; Film Editors Guild for Motion Pictures; United Film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Directors Association of the Philippines; Sound Technicians Association for Motion Pictures; and Assistant Directors and Production Managers Guild of the Philippines. The Organization of Specialized Filipino Filmmakers and the ActorsWorkshopFoundation were integrated into the academy in 1989. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The signatories to the FAP&rsquo;s constitution and bylaws were the first elected chairs of the guilds: Ma. Azucena (Marichu) P. Maceda, Leonardo Monteverde, RobertArevalo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4884\"><strong>Nick Lizaso</strong></a>, Jose F.Lacaba, Ricardo Trofeo, JuanitoClemente, Gervacio Santos, JosefinoCenizal, DezBautista, Marcelo Victoriano Jr, and JosephEstrada. FAP has served as an umbrella organization for the betterment of the guilds in the collection of funding, projects, and other growth opportunities for learning and for experience of the organization members. It stands as the Philippines&rsquo; counterpart of the United States&rsquo; Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Oscars. Manuel de Leon, Espiridion Laxa, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3084\"><strong>Leo Martinez</strong></a> served as chairs of the FAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">FAP supports member-guilds through subsidies and financial assistance to their activities; advocates legislative and administrative measures to promote the well-being of the film industry and its workers; mediates between guilds as well as between film producers and theater operators to promote better understanding, cooperation, and solidarity among the various sectors; and participates in civic and cultural projects. It used to send scholars to the Mowelfund Film Institute. It also used to publish <b><i>Cinema</i></b>, a quarterly publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The FAP co-sponsored with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts the annual Pelikula at Lipunan (Film and Society) Festival in February in conjunction with the Philippine Arts Month. FAP also contributes to the staging and managing of the annual Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) from which the organization gets a share of 20 percent of the MMFF earnings. The organization also chooses the country&rsquo;s film entries and delegates to foreign film festivals. FAP oversees the partnership between the movie industry and the government agencies to gain opportunities for the guilds and its members. The organization also gives clearances for foreign productions to shoot films in the Philippines. FAP offers all the assistance required by such foreign producers&mdash;from location permits, equipment rentals, employing talents, and even accommodations and tours&mdash;in return for the partnership that enables the growth of the film industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">The academy gives out annual awards and other forms of recognition for significant efforts and accomplishments toward the improvement of the motion picture arts and sciences in the country, because two of its goals are (1) to give credit to artistic and technical distinction of performances and (2) to highlight the value of quality works of people behind exceptional movie productions during the year. It seeks to encourage the upgrading of craftsmanship among the movie industry workforces who will eventually raise the bar for local films. The Film Academy of the Philippines started giving the FAP awards in 1983 to honor the achievements of films shown in 1982. It has continued this recognition, which was renamed Luna Awards in 2005 to honor the great Filipino artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>. The voting process for the Luna Awards has beeen conducted by FAP with the help of the Asian Institute of Management starting in 2004.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">The FAP gives awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Editing, Best Musical Score, and Best Sound. In the first FAP awards night held in 1983, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4667\"><strong>Phillip Salvador</strong></a> won the Best Actress and Best Actor awards, respectively. The FAP also inducts into its Hall of Fame those who have garnered at least five competitive awards. The individuals include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\"><strong>Willy Cruz</strong></a> in 1987 with 13 awards, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4734\"><strong>Romy Vitug</strong></a> in 1988 with eight awards, Phillip Salvador in 1994 with eight awards, Edgardo Vinarao in 1991 with seven awards, and Ricky Lee in 1996 with seven awards.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the recipients of the Lifetime Achievement Awards from 1983 to 1992 are National Artists for film LambertoV.Avellana and GerardodeLeon, RichardAbelardo, LuisF.Nolasco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4580\"><strong>Consuelo P.

However, recent problems with regard to funding has affected the Luna Awards. The last Luna Award was given in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several issues have hounded the FAP through the years. First, although it was organized to professionalize the film industry, some of its member guilds allegedly began to operate like unions to ensure work for its members. Moreover, many members allegedly refused to report how they used their annual budgets and were unwilling to study new cinematic technologies. Because of such concerns, some members split from the FAP, like the group of leading directors who formed the Directors Guild of the Philippines Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These problems also manifested themselves in the failure of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\"><strong>Marilou Diaz-Abaya</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> to receive a single FAP award in 1999&mdash;something considered unbelievable since the film won most of the MMFF awards the prior year. The controversy worsened after the academy officials admitted that the film became the victim of the resentment of certain guilds against the director. Apparently, Diaz-Abaya and her colleagues were being ostracized for putting their faith in free trade and professionalism in the local film industry. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byMauro Tumbocon Jr, updated by Sylvelyn Jo Almanzor and Johann Vladimir J.

The mandate of the FDCP is primarily to create and administer programs that would advance the craft of filmmaking in the country. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The mandate of the Film Development Council of the Philippines is, first and foremost, to create and implement programs that advance the craft of filmmaking and, second, to espouse the commercial production of films that touch on the human condition and portray the dignity of the human spirit. It also takes advantage of the country&rsquo;s setting as a location site for international movie and television productions that can generate income. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the programs of the FDCP is to support the outstanding films through tax incentives. The Cinema Evaluation Board has an incentive reward system based on merit to encourage the production of quality films. Films that are graded &ldquo;A&rdquo; receive a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> percent rebate of the amusement tax; films that are rated &ldquo;B&rdquo; receive 65 percent tax rebate. The remaining 35 percent of the amusement tax from the films rated &ldquo;B&rdquo; is credited to the funds of the FDCP.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Film Export Services Office is also part of the FDCP that promotes the country as a site for foreign productions. One of the popular American films shot in the country is <b><i>The Bourne Legacy</i></b>, 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The FDCP has also been active in sponsoring international film festivals, like the World Premieres Film Festival, through its International Film Festival Committee. The evaluation board selects local films to be showcased during the festival alongside films taken around the world. The participating filmmakers and participants receive film grants of varying amounts as well as awards for Best Picture (1st and 2nd place), Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> Score, Best Sound Engineering, Best Production Design, Best Performance by an Actor, Best Performance by an Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Supporting Actress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The FDCP also aims to develop film audiences. The theme of its program, the Sineng Pambansa (National Cinema), is &ldquo;bringing the Filipino films to Filipinos.&rdquo; A vital part of this program is the establishment of cin&eacute;math&egrave;ques in major cities like Baguio, Davao, Iloilo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>. Sineng Pambansa programs special screenings of classic Filipino films and contemporary independent films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another program of FDCP is the National Film Archive of the Philippines (NFAP), which aims to conserve the film heritage of the country.

The last movie the company made was <b><i>Pakners</i></b> (Partners), 2003, which also starred nine-ball billiards champion Efren &ldquo;Bata&rdquo; Reyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">FPJ Studios was also tapped for postproduction facilities for films such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><strong>Aguila</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a></i></b>, 1980; <b><i>Lovingly Yours, Helen</i></b> <b><i>(The Movie)</i></b>, 1984; <b><i>Kahit Konting Pagtingin </i></b>(Just a Little Love),<b><i> </i></b>1990; and <b><i>Isusumbong Kita sa Tatay Ko</i></b> (I&rsquo;ll Tell on You to My Father), 1999. It was also the distributor of quite a number of films from 1967 to 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1980s, FPJ entered into a contract with GMA Network for the television airing of all the films starring Fernando Poe Jr under the program <b><i>FPJ sa GMA</i></b><i> </i>(FPJ at GMA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of its most important productions is an unfinished opus by the late National Artist Gerardo de Leon, titled <b><i>Juan de la</i> <i>Cruz</i></b>,<i> </i>starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\"><strong>Gloria Romero</strong></a>, Fernando Poe Jr, Susan Roces, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4403\"><strong>Johnny Delgado</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4456\"><strong>Rosemarie Gil</strong></a>, Dranreb, Van de Leon, and Tony Carreon. The movie was 70 percent done when the director died in 1981. Fragments of the film were shown in a tribute to Gerardo de Leon at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> in 1990, and once again by the Society of Filipino Archivists for Film in 2014 during the yearlong celebration of Gerardo de Leon&rsquo;s birth centennial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In its 40-odd years as a movie-producing company, FPJ Productions remained active in the industry, contributing to the legend of Fernando Poe Jr as star, producer, writer, and director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">FPJ was around 9 or 10 years old when the film collection of his actor-father Fernando Poe Sr was razed in a fire. Thus, when he was still alive, FPJ transferred his films from the highly flammable celluloid to whatever less flammable medium was available then until the coming of the digital era. Roces&rsquo;s nephew, film archivist Jeffrey Sonora, manages the FPJ Archive using the latest equipment available to preserve FPJ&rsquo;s legacy .</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">FPJ Productions may not be producing films anymore, but FPJ Inc remains the sole owner of the film rights to the titles in its catalog. In 2013, media conglomerate ABS-CBN acquired the rights to FPJ&rsquo;s exclusive movie library, or movies that feature FPJ as an actor, director, or producer. The films are screened on free-to-air TV channels, cable TV channels (Studio 23, Cinema One, and Jeepney TV), as well as international TV networks like The Filipino Channel and Cinema One Global. Moreover, the FPJ compound in Quezon City hosts a mini-museum that showcases photos, movie stills, posters, and FPJ memorabilia items. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLena S.

Manila 1959. Film and television director, writer, producer. His parents are Rolando Jeturian and Cristina Reyes.

His next film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1265\"><strong>Pila Balde</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Fetch a Pail of Water</i></b>), 1999, was produced similarly.

He directed two films in 2004: the sex-comedy <b><i>Bridal Shower</i></b> and the indie drama <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1236\"><strong>Minsan Pa</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Moment More</i></b>). The commercial success of <b><i>Bridal Shower</i></b> led to another film of the same nature, <b><i>Bikini Open</i></b>, 2005. Considered a turning point in his career and one of the key films in the resurgence of Filipino independent cinema in the 2000s is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1208\"><strong>Kubrador</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Bet Collector</i></b>), 2006, starring Gina Pare&ntilde;o.

Naic, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a> 2 Jan 1945. Music director. His parents, Josefina Vasquez and Moises Jocson, were rice-mill owners in their town. His father taught piano privately while running the family business. The eldest son in the family, Domingo, finished music, major in piano, at the University of the Philippines College of Music. Jocson wanted to pursue music as a profession, but his father dissuaded him because his elder brother was already in that field. In deference to his father&rsquo;s wishes, he took up civil engineering at the University of Santo Tomas, but shifted to classical guitar, church choir music, conducting, and photography in his fifth year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jocson&rsquo;s interest in photography led him to the LVN studio where he worked as a color timer in the laboratory. Exposed to the world of filmmaking, he attended seminars and training programs in editing and directing.

It was during this time that Jessie got hooked on George Lucas&rsquo;s Star Wars series, which stirred his interest in film music scoring and led him to dream of becoming a musician. However, after graduating from high school, his parents discouraged him from choosing music as a career, so he took up political science at Saint Louis University (SLU), Baguio City. Nonetheless, his engagement with music continued, playing the xylophone for a marching band that paid for his college tuition and teaching organ lessons. In addition, he was active in the school&rsquo;s musical activities and even staged a concert titled &ldquo;Finger Touch,&rdquo; which was his<b><i> </i></b>first venture in concert producing, musical directing, and performing. Proceeds from that concert went to the purchase of a piano for the SLU College of Human Sciences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1988 he graduated with a political science degree.

A reaction to the dominance of Hollywood movies in the country, it developed a monopoly of production for nearly six years during the era of silent films. The first production of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4524\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>n Movies</strong></a> was the popular <i>sarsuwela <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></b> </i>(Country Maiden), written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\"><strong>Hermogenes Ilagan</strong></a>. The movie, which starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong>Atang</strong></a> de la Rama, premiered in September 1919 and became a hit. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of Malayan&rsquo;s films, <b><i>Ang Tatlong Hambog</i></b><i> </i>(The Three Braggarts), 1926, is well remembered because it featured the first lips-to-lips kissing scene on-screen, between Luis Tuason and Elizabeth &ldquo;Dimples&rdquo; Cooper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1930, Malayan produced the much-acclaimed <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Touch Me Not), and in 1933 its first talking picture, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1270\"><strong>Punyal na Ginto</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Golden Dagger).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nepomuceno, however, had to stop operations later on due to increasing problems in distribution and exhibition. In the latter part of the 1960s, his son Luis Nepomuceno put up Nepomuceno Productions, which made big-budget films like <b><i>Dahil sa Isang <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Bulaklak</span></i></b><i> </i><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">(Because of a Flower), <b><i>Pipo</i></b>, and <b><i>Manila: Open City</i></b>,<i> </i>1967; <b><i>Ang Pulubi</i></b><i> </i>(The Beggar), 1969; and <b><i>The Pacific Connection</i></b>,<i> </i>1974. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Other silent films of Malayan Movies are <b><i>Un Capullo Marchito </i></b>(One Withered Bud), 1920; <b><i>Hoy O</i></b> <b><i>Nunca, Besame </i></b>(Now or Never, Kiss Me), 1922; <b><i>Mariposa Negra</i></b><i> </i>(Black Butterfly), 1923; <b><i>The Filipino Woman</i></b>,<i> </i>1927; <b><i>Ang Manananggal</i></b><i> </i>(The Viscera Sucker), 1929; <b><i>Maria Luisa</i></b>,<i> </i>1930; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> sa Ligaw</i></b><i> </i>(Child by Courtship), 1930, a film based on the novel by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\"><strong>Julian Cruz Balmaseda</strong></a> which introduced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4432\"><strong>Gregorio Fernandez</strong></a> to screen audiences for the first time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Among the early &ldquo;talkies&rdquo; of Malayan Movies are <b><i>Dr. Kuba</i></b><i> </i>(Dr Hunchback), <b><i>Magkabilang Mukha</i></b><i> </i>(Both Faces), and <b><i>Ang Ganid</i></b><i> </i>(The Greedy One), 1933; <b><i>Ang Kamay ng Diyos</i></b><i> </i>(The Hand of God) and <b><i>Sawing Palad</i></b><i> </i>(The Unfortunate), 1934; and <b><i>Krus na Bato</i></b><i> </i>(Stone Cross), 1936. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Mauro Tumbocon Jr</strong> </em></span></p>\r\n"

Davao City 20 Sep 1964. Director, screenwriter, producer, playwright, lyricist, fictionist. He is the son of Manuel Tambor Mardoquio and Almida Mutia. Born and raised in Davao City, his filmic materials are primarily based on life in Mindanao; his narratives are tapestry-like in their multicharacter and multi-setting structures, and his themes are vehicles for his self-avowed peace advocacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mardoquio&rsquo;s first film, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1182\"><strong>Hunghong sa Yuta</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2174\"><strong>Earth</strong></a>&rsquo;s Whisper</i></b>), 2008, is set in a mountain community where Christians, Muslims, and <i>lumads</i> (indigenous people) all have to survive the ongoing conflict between the military and the rebel forces. It revolves around the character of a deaf-mute boy who sees the tragedies of war that befall even those whose lives have been devoted to reconciliation and education. His second film, <b><i>Hospital Boat</i></b>, 2009, is a narrative organized around the roving medical mission of development workers in the coastal villages of Sulu. The film depicts the poverty-stricken lives of island communities inhabited by different cultures and religions, as well as the efforts of selfless individuals that run counter to the purposes of warlords and despots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Sheika</i></b>, 2010, follows the travails of the titular character as she runs away from war-torn Jolo, where she lost her husband, to take shelter in the equally devastating city of Davao, where she loses her two sons. The film was awarded Best Film by the Network for the Promotion of Asian Cinema at the 2010 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4337\"><strong>Cinemanila International Film Festival</strong></a> (CIFF) and Best Screenplay and Best Actress (Fe GingGing Hyde) at the 2011 Gawad Urian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mardoquio&rsquo;s succeeding films probe further the many facets of war and the people that become helplessly involved in it. <b><i>Crossfire</i></b>, 2011, follows the lives of <i>bakwits</i> or displaced refugees who are caught between warring factions and are forced to take sides. <b><i>Ang Paglalakbay ng mga Bituin sa Gabing Madilim</i></b>(<b><i>The Journey of Stars into the Dark Night</i></b>), 2012, traces the escape of Faidal, whose parents were once Muslim freedom fighters but ended up as kidnap-for-ransom bandits. When he ends up orphaned, with a bagful of money, Faidal flees, with the aid of his relatives and with local and American troops, as well as the military, hot on his trail. The film received the Jury Prize at the 2012 Cinema <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Originals Film Festival and the 2012 CIFF, as well as the Best Screenplay award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4740\"><strong>Young Critics Circle Film Desk</strong></a> in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ang mga Tigmo sa Akong Pagpauli </i></b>(<b><i>Riddles of My Homecoming</i></b>), 2013, is an experimental feature-length film without dialogue. Shot in typhoon-ravaged Compostela Valley, dreamlike imagery rather than narrative drives the film and its visualization of the conflicted history of Mindanao. It won Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Music, and the Special Jury Prize in the 2013 Cinema One Originals Film Festival and Best Editing in the 2014 Gawad Urian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Alienasyon </i></b>(<b><i>Alienation</i></b>), 2014, is not set in Mindanao but in the &ldquo;Diliman Estates,&rdquo; although it follows the trajectory of <b><i>Ang mga Tigmo sa Akong Pagpauli </i></b>in its interest in history and war. <b><i>Alienasyon </i></b>centers on the memories of a university professor who recalls his youth during the war and depicts how land, along with time, changes. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byPatrick Campos</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Manila 10 Jul 1971. Screenwriter, playwright, and film director and producer. His parents are Pedrito Martinez and Leticia Dacanay. He graduated from the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman with a bachelor of science in business administration. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Martinez was active in the theater scene in UP. His notable play <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/589\"><strong>Last Order sa Penguin</strong></a> </i></b>(Last Order at Penguin) was first staged by the UP Theater Council in 2000 (under the direction of Martinez himself). The play tells the story of five longtime friends who, after not seeing each other for several years, meet one night at the Penguin Caf&eacute;, a caf&eacute; cum art gallery in Malate, to catch up on each other&rsquo;s lives. The play captures the fears of people who are entering their 30s, that pivotal moment in life when one finally says goodbye to youth and starts facing real responsibilities. In 2001, <b><i>Last Order sa Penguin</i></b> won for Martinez the Don <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\"><strong>Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Martinez&rsquo;s first foray into movies was writing the screenplay for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4485\"><strong>Jeffrey Jeturian</strong></a>&rsquo;s sex comedy <b><i>Bridal Shower</i></b>, 2004, an entry in the Metro Manila Film Festival. This was followed by another Jeturian comedy, <b><i>Bikini Open</i></b>, 2005. Then, he co-wrote with director Chito S. Ro&ntilde;o the screenplays for Ro&ntilde;o&rsquo;s <b><i>Sukob</i></b> (The Wedding Curse), 2006, and <b><i>Caregiver</i></b>, 2008. Martinez&rsquo;s directorial debut came when he joined the 2008 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\"><strong>Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival</strong></a> with his drama <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a></i></b>, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4413\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Mylene Dizon</strong></a></strong></a> as a young cancer patient who writes a list of 100 things that she wants to do before she dies. <b><i>100</i></b> won for Martinez the awards for Best Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Film at Cinemalaya, as well as the Audience Award at the 2008 Pusan International Film Festival and the Emile Guimet Award at the 2009 Vesoul Asian Film Festival.

He then co-wrote (with Marlon Rivera) and directed a segment of the omnibus film <b><i>My Valentine Girls</i></b>, 2011. The hilarious segment, &ldquo;Gunaw&rdquo; (End of the World), takes place after the world has ended and it is up to the seemingly last two persons on earth, Aidan (Richard Gutierrez) and Ivy (Eugene Domingo), to mate and repopulate the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2011, Martinez embarked on a remake of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4462\"><strong>Joey Gosiengfiao</strong></a>&rsquo;s 1980 cult classic, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1301\"><strong>Temptation Island</strong></a></i></b>.

The film is a satire on the &ldquo;indie&rdquo; film scene and stars Eugene Domingo as a narcissistic movie star who is convinced by three young filmmakers to appear in their film about poverty, titled &ldquo;Walang-Wala&rdquo;<b> </b>(Destitute). <b><i>Ang Babae sa Septic Tank</i></b> won for Martinez the Best Screenplay award at Cinemalaya. The following year, Martinez wrote the sequel <b><i>Kimmy Dora and the Temple of Kiyeme</i></b> (Kimmy Dora and the Temple of Nonsense), 2012. After the Kimmy Dora sequel, Martinez wrote and directed <b><i>I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila! </i></b>(I Do Bidoo Bidoo: The APO Is Here!), 2012, a musical film that features the music of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\"><strong>Apo Hiking Society</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The year 2013 was another prolific year for Martinez.

Also in 2014, Martinez co-wrote with director Antoinette Jadaone the satirical comedy <b><i>Beauty in a Bottle</i></b>. In 2015, he directed <b><i>You&rsquo;re Still the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a></i></b>, from a screenplay by Aloy Adlawan. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Elvin Valerio</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Bacolod, Negros Occidental 1965. Film and television director, screenwriter, producer. His parents are Enrique Celemente Buenaflor Matti and Julieta Parra Seminio. He went to Colegio de San Agustin for his primary and secondary education and the University of St. La Salle for college. He founded the film production company Reality Entertainment with Dondon Monteverde, son of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\"><strong>Regal Films</strong></a> matriarch Lily Monterverde.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Matti started his career in the 1990s and first gained credit as a writer for the films of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\"><strong>Peque Gallaga</strong></a> and Lore Reyes, including <b><i>Magic</i> <i>Temple</i></b>, 1996; <b><i>Mortal Kombat: Alamat ng Damortis </i></b>(Mortal Combat: The Legend of Damortis), 1997; and <b><i>Gangland</i></b>, 1998.

These two movies, including <b><i>Dos Ekis</i></b> (Two X&rsquo;s) in 2001 and <b><i>Prosti</i></b> (Prostitute) in 2002, marked Matti as director of sexy, erotic work, one of the genres he would be known for. In 2001, he directed <b><i>Sa Huling Paghihintay </i></b>(The Final Wait), starring Rica Peralejo and Bernard Palanca. He took over directing duties of Lily Monteverde&rsquo;s popular franchise <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1226\"><strong>Mano Po</strong></a> 2: My Home</i></b>, 2003.

These include appearances in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1129\"><strong>Broken Marriage</strong></a></i></b>, 1983; <b><i>Working Girls</i></b>, 1984; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1180\"><strong>Hinugot sa Langit</strong></a></i></b> (Wrenched from Heaven), 1985; and <b><i>The Graduates</i></b>, 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After appearing in a series of sexy adult dramas, such as <b><i>Ibigin Mo Ako nang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1176\"><strong>Higit sa Lahat</strong></a></i></b> (Love Me More Than Anyone Else), 1987; <b><i>Mahirap ang Magmahal</i></b> (It Is Difficult to Love), 1989; <b><i>Bihagin ang Dalagang Ito</i></b> (Capture This Maiden), 1989; and <b><i>Kokak</i></b>, 1989, Montano got the break of his career when he was paired with popular sexy actors Rita Avila and Rina Reyes in Mauro Gia Samonte&rsquo;s fantasy drama <b><i>Machete: Istatwang Buhay </i></b>(Machete: Live Statue), 1990. In the film, Montano plays Machete, a wooden statue who comes to life to fulfill the desires of his beautiful but lonely creator Lorna (Avila). Despite its flimsy narrative, <b><i>Machete</i></b> was a huge box-office success and made a movie star out of Montano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the rest of the decade, Montano&rsquo;s career continued to thrive.

Only the last was successful in bringing in the much needed funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Metro Manila Commission (MMC) took over the MMFF in 1977, which was marred by a controversy brought about by insults from the judges causing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a>, and Mike de Leon to return their trophies. In 1978 the MMC gave back the filmfest to Mowelfund&rsquo;s management until 1985. The year 1979 saw the establishment of the Mowelfund Film Institute (MFI) in response to the need to raise consciousness among filmmakers and their audience of a better film culture in the country. Through the years, the MFI successfully filled its role as mentor and training ground for film students and professionals alike via scholarship programs, film workshops, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1986 many changes happened. First, the foundation established a permanent home in a wholly owned prime location on Rosario Drive in the heart of Quezon City by April. It was a timely investment of 5.1 million pesos, made before the post-EDSA Revolt government almost sequestered its assets. In December, the former MMC, now the Metro Manila Development Authority, once again took over the MMFF, continuing to manage it until today. However, the Mowelfund is awarded 60 percent share of the net total of the amusement tax, while 20 percent goes to the Film Academy of the Philippines and 20 percent to the Anti-Film Piracy Board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With its share in the MMFF earnings, the foundation is able to fulfill its social commitments, including medical and death benefits to about 5,000 members, composed of workers in the artistic, creative, technical, and labor sectors in the industry, most of whom come from the low-income group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In addition, the Mowelfund is able to honor its educational commitments, through the Mowelfund Film Institute, established in 1979, which trains would-be filmmakers in the craft of filmmaking through practicum-oriented workshops on directing, photography, scriptwriting, editing, and other aspects of filmmaking, and in coordination with other institutions for seminars and lectures. The MFI has been one of the industry&rsquo;s leading training ground for innovation and cinematic excellence both for mainstream and independent productions.

		"text": "<p><strong>NATIONAL COMMISSION FOR CULTURE AND THE ARTS (NCCA)</strong> Created by Republic Act 7356 on 3 Apr 1992, it was preceded by the Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts, established by Executive Order 118 in 1987. The NCCA is tasked to formulate policies for the development of culture and arts; encourage artistic creation within a climate of artistic freedom; develop and promote the Filipino national culture and arts; and preserve Filipino cultural heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The law stipulates the objectives of NCCA: &ldquo;to formulate policies for the development of culture and the arts; implement such policies and programs in coordination with cultural agencies affiliated to it: the  <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong>, the National Historical Institute (now the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2683\"><strong>National Historical Commission of the Philippines</strong></a>), the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\">National Museum</a></strong>, the National Library, the Commission of Filipino Language, and the Records Management and Archives Office; administer the National Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA); encourage artistic creation within a climate of artistic freedom; develop and promote the Filipino national culture and arts; and preserve the Filipino national culture&rdquo; (NCCA, n.d.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, the NCCA seeks to encourage the continuing and balanced development of a pluralistic culture&mdash;that is, multiethnic&mdash;by the people themselves; conserve and promote the nation&rsquo;s historical and cultural heritage; ensure the widest dissemination of artistic and cultural products within the country and overseas; preserve and integrate traditional culture and their various creative expressions as a dynamic part of the national cultural mainstream; and ensure that standards of excellence are pursued in programs and activities by encouraging and supporting continuing discussions and debates on Philippine culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NCCA has four subcommissions. Under these subcommissions are 22 independent committees composed of artists and cultural workers considered experts in their fields, who advice the NCCA on matters of direction, policies, and programs. The Subcommission on Cultural Heritage is composed of six national committees: the National Committees on Archives, Art Galleries, Historical Research, Libraries and Information Services, Monuments and Sites, and Museums. The Subcommission on the Arts includes the National Committees on Architecture and Allied Arts, Cinema, Dance, Dramatic Arts, Literary Arts, Music, and Visual Arts. The National Committee on Literary Arts evaluates and funds projects that include regional and national writing workshops, literary awards, conferences, and its flagship Philippine Writers Festival project, often held during the Philippine Arts Festival on February of each year. The Subcommission on Cultural Dissemination is composed of the National Committees on Education, Communication, and Language and Translation. The Subcommission on Cultural Communities and Traditional Arts includes the National Committees on Northern Cultural Communities, Central Cultural Communities, and Southern Cultural Communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NCCA is governed by a Board of Commissioners composed of 15 members&mdash;namely, the NCCA chairman and executive director; the chairpersons of the Senate Committee on Education, Arts, and Culture, the House Committee on Basic Education and Culture, the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5426\"><strong>Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino</strong></a></strong>, and the National Historical Commission of the Philippines; the director of the National Museum and the National Library of the Philippines; the executive director of the National Archives of the Philippines; the president of the Cultural Center of the Philippines; as well as representatives from the Departments of Education and Tourism and the private sector. This Board of Commissioners is also assisted by a National Advisory Board composed of 19 national committee heads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its projects and activities have covered skills enhancement; research, documentation, and data banking; awards; scholarships; competitions; publications; conferences, seminars, or workshops; performances, exhibits, or festivals; international desk; and women&rsquo;s concerns. Examples of supported projects for 2015 include festivals in Bokod (Benguet) and Sagada (Mountain Province); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong>Rizal</strong></a> Arts Festival; 40th International Bamboo Organ Festival, Las Pi&ntilde;as; Cinema in the Regions; performing arts and exhibitions, like <strong><em><strong>Manhid</strong> : The Pinoy Superhero</em></strong> of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\">Ballet Philippines</a></strong> Foundation and the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a></strong> retrospective; and seminars, workshops, and historical conferences like the 24th Annual Manila Studies Conference and the Seminar Workshop on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\"><strong>Waray</strong></a> Poetry Performance. It is also actively involved in the restoration of the heritage churches damaged during the Oct 2013 earthquake that devastated the Visayas. NCCA has a publication department, which carries some 103 titles consisting primarily of print, although CDs and e-books as media of dissemination have been introduced. Some printed works are monographs and journals, like <strong><em><strong>Bulawan</strong> </em></strong>, <strong><em><strong> <strong>Ani</strong> </strong> </em></strong>, and <strong><em>Espasyo</em></strong>, which are published periodically. <em><strong>Written by NCCA, Rosalinda Galang, updated by Glenn Diaz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Quiapo, Manila 15 May 1893. d. Manila 1 Dec 1959. Movie producer and director, acknowledged as the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Movies.&rdquo; His parents are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\"><strong>Jose Nepomuceno</strong></a> and Teofila Zialcita. He married Isabel Acu&ntilde;a, by whom he had eight children, among whom are child actors Lubin and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4570\"><strong>Angelito Nepomuceno</strong></a>, and Luis Nepomuceno, who became a film director. He graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from San Beda College and finished a course in fine arts at the University of Santo Tomas. An accredited correspondent for Pathe News and Paramount News of Hollywood, Nepomuceno acquired experience in his career by making documentaries and newsreels on various events, such as the funeral of the first wife of Sergio Osme&ntilde;a Sr and the great Kanto earthquake in Japan, and by making English and Spanish subtitles for films that were then imported from Europe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nepomuceno started out as a photographer and proprietor of his photo studio Electro-Photo-Studio Parhelio. Later he sold his studio, then the biggest and most expensive in the country, and founded <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4524\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>n Movies</strong></a> in 1917. After two years of experimentation and training, he finally made <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Country Maiden), 1919, the first Filipino-produced feature film. This was followed by <b><i>La Venganza de Don</i></b><i> <b>Silvestre</b> </i>(The Vengeance of Don Silvestre), 1919, a sequel to <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b>;<b><i> Un</i></b><i> <b>Capullo Marchito</b> </i>(A Withered Bud), 1920; <b><i>Hoy o Nunca Besame</i></b><i> </i>(Kiss Me Now or Never), 1923; and <b><i>La Mariposa Negra</i></b><i> </i>(Black Beauty), 1923. In 1926, he made <b><i>Ang Tatlong</i></b><i> <b>Hambog</b> </i>(The Three Braggarts), starring Luis Tuason and Elizabeth &ldquo;Dimples&rdquo; Cooper who did the first kissing scene in the local movie industry. In 1933, he produced <b><i>Punyal na</i></b><i> <b>Ginto</b> </i>(Golden Dagger). His films dominated the first years of the talkies: <b><i>Dr. Kuba</i></b><i> </i>(Dr Hunchback), 1933, starring Rosa del Rosario and Jose Padilla Jr; <b><i>Sawing Palad</i></b><i> </i>(The Unfortunate), 1934, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4572\"><strong>Corazon Noble</strong></a>, and Rogelio de la Rosa; <b><i>Santong Diablo</i></b><i> </i>(Holy Devil), 1936, starring Leopoldo Salcedo and Purita Santa Maria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Constantly plagued by lack of capital, he was producer, storyteller, scriptwriter, cameraman, labman, art director, film editor, distributor, and exhibitor of his films. His home and studios burned down in 1921 and 1923 but he never gave up. He then formed Malayan Pictures Corporation in 1923, Nepomuceno Productions in 1932, the Nepomuceno-Harris-Tait partnership in 1933, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\"><strong>Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</strong></a> Inc in 1935, X&rsquo;Otic Films in 1938, and Polychrome Motion Pictures Corporation in 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nepomuceno shared his skills with other pioneering producers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\"><strong>Vicente Salumbides</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4526\"><strong>Julian Manansala</strong></a>.

Two years later, the proposed legislation was signed into law by President Arroyo, in effect creating the OMB. The OMB&rsquo;s authority covers the entire territory of the Philippines. Host-actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4531\"><strong>Edu Manzano</strong></a> was appointed by President Arroyo as the first chairman of the OMB. Manzano was replaced by action star Ronald &ldquo;Ronnie&rdquo; Ricketts after the former resigned in August 2009. In 2013, Ricketts was given the Special Recognition Award by the Metro Manila Film Festival for his work at the OMB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">To further strengthen its campaign against media piracy, the OMB also works with police authorities and other organizations, such as the National Cinema Association of the Philippines and the Movie Picture Anti-Film Piracy Council of the Philippines. Law enforcement agencies, including the OMB, confiscated around 6.8 billion pesos worth of fake goods during the first half of 2014. With the help of the OMB, the Philippines was removed from the United States&rsquo; list of piracy hot spots or the Special 301 Watch List. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Kathrina Alvarez</strong> </em></span></p>\r\n"

Daet, Camarines Norte 23 Nov 1969. Movie and television actor and screenwriter. He is the son of Casimiro Padilla Sr aka Roy Padilla, a movie director who became vice-governor of Camarines Norte in the 1970s and an assemblyman in the 1980s, and Lolita Eva Cari&ntilde;o, a former movie actor. Padilla belongs to one of the most prominent clans in Philippine show business that spans four generations. His father&rsquo;s brother, actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4581\"><strong>Carlos Padilla</strong></a> Sr, is the father of former actor turned professional boxing referee Carlos &ldquo;Sonny&rdquo; Padilla Jr. In turn, Carlos Padilla Jr is the father of singer/actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\"><strong>Zsa Zsa Padilla</strong></a> and the grandfather of singer/TV host Karylle (Zsa Zsa&rsquo;s daughter). Erstwhile actor Melanie Padilla, a sister of Roy and Carlos Sr, is the mother of singer Gino Padilla. Another sister, Paz, is the mother of the late action star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4433\"><strong>Rudy Fernandez</strong></a> and former actor Merle Fernandez. Out of Padilla&rsquo;s seven siblings, three are in show business: BB Gandanghari (formerly Rustom), Rommel, and Royette. Three of Rommel&rsquo;s sons have also turned to acting: Rommel Antonio (screen name: RJ), Ralph Matthew (screen name: Matt), and their half-brother Daniel (Rommel&rsquo;s son with actor Karla Estrada). Padilla is the father of television actors Kylie and Queenie, his daughters with ex-wife Liezel Sicangco. He is also the uncle of actor Bela Padilla, whose grandmother is the sister of Lolita Eva Cari&ntilde;o (Padilla&rsquo;s mother). After divorcing his first wife, Padilla married TV host Mariel Rodriguez on 19 Aug 2010 at the Taj Mahal in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Exposed by his parents to show business at a young age, Padilla decided to follow in their footsteps. At the age of 16, he first appeared in a small role in the action-comedy <b><i>Public Enemy No. 2: Maraming Number 2</i></b> (Public Enemy No. 2: So Many Number 2s), 1985. His first major movie role is in director Ricardo &ldquo;Bebong&rdquo; Osorio&rsquo;s action-packed <b><i>Bala Ko ang Hahatol</i></b> (My Bullet Will Be the Judge), 1985. The following year, he teamed up with Jinggoy Estrada and E.R. Ejercito in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4304\"><strong>Augusto Buenaventura</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Bagets Gang </i></b>(Teenage Gang), 1986. After a series of supporting roles in more action movies, Padilla starred opposite <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4748\"><strong>Dawn Zulueta</strong></a> in <b><i>Hindi Ako Pahuhuli ng Buhay</i></b> (I Will Not Be Caught Alive), 1989. He also headlined action director Deo Fajardo Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Carnap King: The Randy Padilla Story</i></b>, 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The year 1990 signaled the arrival of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4583\"><strong>Robin Padilla</strong></a> as Philippine cinema&rsquo;s newest action star, making five movies in that year alone; three of which firmly established his unique action star persona. First was Deo Fajardo Jr&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> ni Baby Ama</i></b> (Son of Baby Ama), 1990, where Padilla plays the son of Baby Ama, a famous character in the Filipino action genre portrayed in an earlier movie by no less than his cousin Rudy Fernandez. This was quickly followed by Willy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1234\"><strong>Milan</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Barumbado</i></b> (Troublemaker), 1990, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4643\"><strong>Eddie Rodriguez</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Bad Boy</i></b>, 1990. The latter earned Padilla the moniker &ldquo;Bad Boy of Philippine Movies.&rdquo; His &ldquo;Bad Boy&rdquo; image embodied the chain-smoking, hard-drinking, uncouth yet handsome young man of the 1990s, ready to self-destruct at any moment due to his excesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The following year, Padilla teamed up with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a> and again with director Eddie Rodriguez in what would turn out to be his most memorable movie: <b><i>Maging Sino Ka Man</i></b> (Whoever You May Be), 1991. The film employs one of the most time-tested formulas in Filipino movies&mdash;that of a wholesome rich girl who falls in love with a poor petty criminal with a heart of gold. Its use of action, romance, and touches of comedy ensured its box-office success and officially turned Padilla into a major movie star.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Riding on the triumph of <b><i>Maging Sino Ka Man</i></b>, Padilla chose one of his co-stars in that movie to be his next leading lady. <b><i>Ang Utol Kong Hoodlum</i></b> (My Hoodlum Brother), 1991, features Padilla with Vina <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es, the teenage newcomer who played Loleng in <b><i>Maging Sino Ka Man </i></b>(the big sister to the group of kids adopted by Padilla&rsquo;s character Carding). <b><i>Ang Utol Kong Hoodlum</i></b> was such a hit at the box office that Padilla decided to make a sequel right away. <b><i>Miss na Miss Kita: Ang Utol Kong Hoodlum 2 </i></b>(I Miss You So Much: My Hoodlum Brother 2), 1992, reunites Padilla with Vina Morales and signals Padilla&rsquo;s first foray as a screenwriter (using his real name: Robinhood Cari&ntilde;o Padilla). Padilla would go on to write the screenplays in some of his succeeding movies, but with less success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 2000s, perhaps sensing that the action genre was on its way out, Padilla transformed himself into a leading man and ventured into other genres. He topbilled a slate of romantic films&mdash;including <b><i>Kailangan Ko&rsquo;y Ikaw</i></b> (You&rsquo;re the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> I Need), 2000; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/967\"><strong>Pagdating ng Panahon</strong></a></i></b> (When the Time Comes), 2001; <b><i>You and Me against the World</i></b>, 2003; <b><i>Till I Met You</i></b>, 2006&mdash;and horror movies like <b><i>Kulimlim</i></b> (Overcast), 2004; <b><i>Blackout</i></b>, 2007; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1010\"><strong>Sundo</strong></a></i></b> (Fetch), 2009. He also became interested in independent films and starred in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4622\"><strong>Jon Red</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>ASTIGmatism</i></b>, 2004, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4542\"><strong>Mark Meily</strong></a>&rsquo;s delightful satire <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1315\"><strong>La Visa Loca</strong></a></i></b> (Crazy Visa), 2005, where he gave one of his best and most mature performances as an actor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">With the decline in film production in the 2000s, Padilla wisely established a career in television. He signed with GMA Network and headlined some of its top television series: <b><i>Asian Treasures</i></b>, 2007; <b><i>Joaquin Burdado</i></b> (Tattooed Joaquin), 2008; and <b><i>Totoy Bato</i></b> (Totoy the Rock), 2009. In 2009, Padilla transferred to rival network <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> to serve as host of the network&rsquo;s popular noontime variety show <b><i>Wowowee </i></b>after its original host, Willie Revillame, abruptly left. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Padilla went on to appear in some of ABS-CBN&rsquo;s television series, including <b><i>Guns and Roses</i></b>, 2011; <b><i>Kailangan Ko&rsquo;y Ikaw</i></b>, 2013; and the sitcom <b><i>Toda Max </i></b>(To the Max), 2011-13. In 2013, he starred in Joyce Bernal&rsquo;s thriller <b><i>10,000 Hours</i></b>, an entry in the Metro Manila Film Festival. In 2014, Padilla played another memorable role as Philippine hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a> in Philippian Films&rsquo; <b><i>Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo</i></b> (Bonifacio: The First President). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Elvin Valerio</strong> </em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

The Big Four had earlier combined to form the Philippine Movie Producers Association (PMPA), which became the nucleus of the new organization. Their first move was to pen a petition for the government to suspend a tariff directive imposing import quotas on raw film stock. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">At that time, first-run theaters in Manila were dominated by American movies except for two that showed exclusively Filipino films: Life Theater in Quiapo and Dalisay Theater on Rizal Avenue. Two other cinema houses along Quezon Boulevard that sometimes showed Filipino films, Center Theater and Globe Theater, also exhibited American movies. All the rest showed only foreign films. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">To alleviate the situation, the PMPPA forged an alliance with Manila Mayor Antonio Villegas to hold the first Manila Film Festival for a period of 10 days beginning 24 Jun 1966 with the celebration of &ldquo;Araw ng Maynila&rdquo; (Manila Day). The city&rsquo;s major thoroughfares and street corners were emblazoned with movie posters announcing a &ldquo;Parade of Stars&rdquo; and the titles of Filipino movies to be shown in the different theaters, which formerly showed only American films. To complete the Filipinization of the event, radio and television stations, jukeboxes, and the &ldquo;sound row&rdquo; on Raon street in downtown Santa Cruz, Manila, played only Filipino music for 10 days. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Three years later, the PMPPA found a champion in Sen Jose Diokno who filed Senate Bill 205 imposing graduated import quotas on foreign movies and allotting 30 percent annual playing time for Filipino films. However, a strong pro-American lobby in Congress defeated the bill. Nevertheless, a 49-day annual quota for local films was won over by PMPPA producers from the local theater distributors who conceded, following the results of the festival, that there was indeed a market for Filipino films. Meanwhile, PMPPA producers set the trend for full-color production so that by 1975, all films were color, and black-and-white movies were a thing of the past. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In the early 1970s, PMPPA producers of big-budgeted films lost heavily in the face of keen competition from non-PMPPA producers whose <b>bomba</b> and X-rated films dominated the theater circuits together with cheap karate imports. Some of the legitimate producers closed shop and/or joined the bandwagon using other trade names. Proclamation 1081 in 1972 discouraged the production of bomba films.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In 1974, the PMPPA leadership under then San Juan mayor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a> created the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\"><strong>Movie Workers Welfare Foundation Inc (Mowelfund)</strong></a> as a private entity to help the workers of the industry. Later, during the term of Marichu Perez Maceda in 1981, the PMPPA instituted the formation of the Film Academy of the Philippines while pursuing at the same time an aggressive program for government to grant subsidies and aid to producers through the Film Fund and the Film Ratings Board. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Past presidents of the PMPA and PMPPA include Judge Jose O.

Its original incorporators include Virtudes Guinto, Romeo Galang, Francisco Ortega Jr, Gemiliano Pineda, Cora Mendoza, Cipriano Roxas, Ethelwolda Ramos, Jose Mari Cavanna, and Daniel Villanueva, who was elected as its first president. The PMPC was preceded by the Movie Press Club of the Philippines, which was established in 1949. Other PMPC presidents after Villanueva were Andy Salao, Franklin Cabaluna, Ethel Ramos, Tony Mortel, Ronald Constantino, Boy de Guia, Billy Balbastro, Hermie Francisco, Ernie Pecho, Ricky Calderon, Letty Celi, and Veronica Samio. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">PMPC holds fund-raising activities, like movie premieres, for the benefit of charitable institutions, as well as annual summer outings, Christmas caroling, and movie writing and photography contests for its members. It became popular for its annual &ldquo;Paistaran&rdquo; organized in 1979 under de Guia&rsquo;s term, which sought to bring the movie press and celebrities together in an atmosphere of fun and camaraderie. Esoteric awards like the &ldquo;Darling of the Press&rdquo; and the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>basa awards&rdquo; were given out. This would act as the springboard for the institution of the annual Star Awards for Movies in 1985 under the administration of Hermie Francisco.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In 1987, the Star Awards for Television was started in order to give recognition to the efforts and aesthetic excellence of TV filmmakers, hosts, and actors. Before several awards were merged and revised, the Star Awards for TV gave out trophies for the following: Best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a> Special, Best Cooking Show and Host, Best Cultural Magazine Show and Host, Best Movie Talk Show and Host, Best Woman-Oriented Show and Host, and others. Throughout the years, the PMPC Star Awards for TV has succeeded in becoming one of the most credible award-giving bodies for television in the country. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In 2003, several PMPC members, mostly newspaper writers and journalists, broke away from the group and formed the Entertainment Press Society (ENPRESS). The following year, this group established its own awards, the Golden Screen Awards for Television.

But Poe&rsquo;s biggest break was <b><i>Lo&rsquo; Waist Gang</i></b>,<i> </i>1956, which marked the local cinema&rsquo;s shift from the fantasy world of costume productions to the trendy realism of action movies. His first solo movie was <b><i>Tough Guy</i></b>,<i> </i>1957. He was then signed up by Premiere Productions as a contract actor.

When they still had their hair, the duo appeared in <i>bodabil</i> shows at the Star Theater in 1936. Like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a> Hardy and Stan Laurel of Hollywood, Togo played the fat man and Pugo, his skinny sparring partner.

He was a mainstay in the weekly radio comedy <b><i>Sebya, Mahal Kita </i></b>(Sebya, I Love You), with SylviaLaTorre, which was made into a movie in 1957, and in the TV shows <b><i>Tang Tarang Tang</i></b> and <b><i>Si Tatang Kasi </i></b>(Blame It on Father).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was for these two TV shows that Pugo received the Citizens&rsquo; Award for Television for Best Actor in 1967 and 1971.

Roces is also grandmother to Jose Gabriel Bautista, Grace&rsquo;s son with Jolo Revilla (son of Ramon &ldquo;Bong&rdquo; Revilla Jr and Lani Mercado), and Maja Adriano Amir, Grace&rsquo;s daughter with Arab national Filly Amir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Roces was introduced by Seiko Films in 1994 as Ana Maceda in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\"><strong>Celso Ad. Castillo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Comfort Women: A Cry for Justice</i></b>. In the same year, she also appeared in Mauro Gia Samonte&rsquo;s <b><i>Machete II</i></b>. In 1995, she changed her screen name to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4637\"><strong>Rosanna Roces</strong></a> and was launched as the lead in two movies: with Jestoni Alarcon in <b><i>Di Mapigil ang Init</i></b> (Can&rsquo;t Stop the Heat), 1995, and with Gardo Versoza in <b><i>Kandungan</i></b> (Lap), 1995. She followed this up with <b><i>Patikim ng Pinya</i></b> (Let Me Taste the Pineapple), 1996, an adult comedy co-starring Leandro Baldemor. <b><i>Patikim ng Pinya</i></b> established Roces as Seiko Films&rsquo; most popular female sexy actor. After doing <b><i>Mga Nagbabagang Labi</i></b> (Fiery Lips), 1996, again with Jestoni Alarcon, Roces renegotiated her exclusive contract with Seiko into a non-exclusive contract that allowed her to work for other movie companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The year 1997 was a busy one for Roces as her career began to peak.

She also co-hosted <b><i>Startalk</i></b>, GMA&rsquo;s popular showbiz-oriented program. This ended when she got into a very public feud with her co-host Lolit Solis (who is also her talent manager). She then transferred to rival network <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> and played supporting roles in soap operas such as <b><i>Ysabella</i></b>,<i> </i>2007, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1469\"><strong>May Bukas Pa</strong></a></i></b> (There&rsquo;s Still Tomorrow), 2009, and <b><i>Tayong Dalawa</i></b> (The Two of Us), 2009. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In recent years, Roces appeared in several indie productions, most notably in Ray Gibraltar&rsquo;s <b><i>Wanted: Border</i></b>, 2009, for which she won a Best Actress award at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\"><strong>Cinema <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Originals Digital Film Festival</strong></a>; in Adolfo Alix Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Haruo</i> </b>(<b><i>Springtime Man</i></b>), 2011, <b><i>Mater Dolorosa</i></b> (Sorrowful Mother), 2013, and <b><i>Porno</i></b>, 2013; and in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4496\"><strong>Joel Lamangan</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Hustisya</i></b> (<b><i>Justice</i></b>), 2014. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Elvin Valerio </strong> </em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n"

Naga City, Camarines Sur 16 Aug 1950. Filmmaker and cartoonist. His parents are Chit Lee and Fortuna Federizon. He finished his elementary and high school at Ateneo de Naga and took up architecture at National University. He started out as a cartoonist, first contributing cartoons to <b><i>Jingle Magazine</i></b><i> </i>and, since 1981, doing the comic strip <b><i>Cesar Asar</i></b><i> </i>for the <b><i>Manila Bulletin</i></b><i> </i>in collaboration with his brother Monlee.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4655\"><strong>Roxlee</strong></a> studied filmmaking at a workshop sponsored by the Mowelfund Film Institute and Ateneo de Manila University in 1981. His early films were shot in Super 8mm and 16mm. Many were done with the assistance of artist-friends like Ludwig Ilio, Benjie Lontoc Jr, Wilfreda Calderon, At Maculangan, and his brother Ruben Lee. His works were exhibited in festivals in Berlin, Hamburg, New York, Hong Kong, and Japan. A retrospective of his films was featured at the Image Forum in Tokyo in 1991.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Roxlee&rsquo;s films, lasting anywhere between 3 and 12 minutes, are freewheeling collages of animation, performance art, and &ldquo;found&rdquo; footage. Often crude in style and defiant of classical film aesthetics, they display raw energy, a morbid sense of humor, and flights of pure nonsense. His subjects are nature in the raw, primordial human urges, and environmental concerns. Among his works are <b><i>Juan Gapang</i></b> (Johnny Crawl),<i> </i>1987, which has a naked semi-human creature crawling through the metropolis, commenting on its decay and congestion; <b><i>Lizard</i></b>,<i> </i>1987, which shows a half-human, half-lizard, dancing to rock music; and <b><i>The Great Smoke</i></b>,<i> </i>1984, an apocalyptic nuclear nightmare.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Roxlee&rsquo;s films won numerous prizes in the short film competitions of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1064\"><strong>Experimental</strong></a> Cinema of the Philippines and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. He was one of the first recipients of the Best Experimental Film prize of the Gawad Urian for <b><i>Juan Gapang</i></b> and the Student Film Prize of the Film Academy of the Philippines. His <b><i>Green Rocking Chair</i></b>, 2008, was featured at the Rotterdam and Singapore International Film Festivals in 2009.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Roxlee served as executive committee member of the National Committee on Cinema of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. In 2006, he received the Daluyan (Vessel) Award as a progressive leader and pioneer in the independent film community in the Philippines.

During World War II, he appeared in the Japanese-produced anti-American film <b><i>Dawn of Freedom</i></b>,<i> </i>1944, which made him a controversial figure. To offset the stigma of &ldquo;collaborator&rdquo; hurled at those who worked with the Japanese, Poe directed and produced a movie where he played the role of a guerrilla soldier, <b><i>Dugo ng Bayan</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>I Remember Bataan</i></b>), 1946. Among his early postwar films were <b><i>Intramuros: The Rape of a City</i></b>,<i> </i>1946; <b><i>Hanggang Pier </i></b>(Until the Pier), 1946; <b><i>Kalbaryo ng Isang Ina</i></b><i> </i>(A Mother&rsquo;s Calvary), 1946; <b><i>Labis na Pagmamahal</i></b><i> </i>(Too Much Love), 1946; and <b><i>Kanto Boy</i></b><i> </i>(Streetcorner Boy), 1947.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.15pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4656\"><strong>Royal Production</strong></a>s is known for the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong> movies that Poe produced, starring Rosa del Rosario in the title role. <b><i>Darna</i></b>,<i> </i>1951, centered on a wonder woman and her nemesis, the snake-headed Valentina portrayed by Cristina Aragon, a Poe next-of-kin. Another Darna film, <b><i>Darna at ang Babaing Lawin</i></b><i> </i>(Darna and the Hawkwoman), 1952, also starring del Rosario, was similarly well-received at the box office.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.15pt\">Poe&rsquo;s sudden death from a dog bite on 23 Oct 1951 cut short any further plans of his company.

Lopez, Quezon 3 Aug 1893. d. 7 Aug 1979. Movie producer, director, actor. His parents are Pio Salumbides and Trinidad Aranillo. He married Rosario H. Panganiban by whom he had eight children. He left law school in Southern California, USA, to join the Allied Forces in France under Gen Pershing in World War I. He returned to the Philippines to finish law studies in 1922, working as company lawyer of the Philippine Trust <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Salumbides used to be an &ldquo;extra&rdquo; in the Famous Players Studio in Hollywood. Upon his return to the Philippines, he pioneered in the local movie industry, initially working with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\"><strong>Jose Nepomuceno</strong></a> as cinematographer. His first movie was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1238\"><strong>Miracles of Love</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1925, which he wrote, directed, edited, produced, and acted in. The cast included Elizabeth Cooper aka Dimples, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2823\"><strong>Jose Carvajal</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\"><strong>Hermogenes Ilagan</strong></a>, and Juanita Angeles. A box office hit, it was hailed by no less than Msgr Gregorio Aglipay and Felipe Buencamino. <b><i>Miracles</i></b><i> </i>introduced many firsts in the local film industry. Makeup, as used by Hollywood actors, eliminated dark shadows on-screen. The close-up shot maximized the effectivity of the medium. The &ldquo;cut back&rdquo; scene emphasized suspense. To ward off prejudices against locally made films, Salumbides recruited the local elite and students of exclusive schools in Manila to appear in <b><i>Fate or Consequence</i></b>,<i> </i>1926, and in his other films. His third movie, <b><i>The Soul Saver</i></b>,<i> </i>1927, is the story of his life and romance and includes some footage of his actual wedding with Panganiban.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">After working as a delegate to the 1935 Constitutional Convention, he returned to filmmaking in 1936.

The group included Judge (later senator) Jose O. Vera, Rep Jose Zulueta, Col Antonio Torres, Dr Catalino Gavino, Dr Pedro Abecilla, and Do&ntilde;a Apolonia vda de Vera. The person they chose to head movie production was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4574\"><strong>Luis F.

With <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> &ldquo;Billy&rdquo; Smith as technical adviser, the Vera family built the studio on a four-hectare lot in the New Manila suburb where sound could more easily be controlled during shooting. On this property, the Sampaguita Studio was born.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The Silos brothers, each one an expert in his own field, took charge of the various production departments: Octavio and Manuel in screenplay and direction, Augusto in laboratory and film processing, and Cesar in cinematography. Their first movie was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\"><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></a></strong></a></i></b> (Beautiful Star), a musical love story based on the immortal composition of the late <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>. It starred the &ldquo;Singing Sweetheart of the Philippines,&rdquo; Elsa Oria, with matinee idol Rogelio de la Rosa. Directed by Carlos Vander Tolosa, it opened at the Grand Theater on 27 Dec 1937. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The success of their initial venture prompted SPI producers to follow it up immediately with other grand musical productions: <b><i>Paroparong Bukid</i></b> (Country Butterfly), 1938, starring Elsa Oria and new leading man <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4343\"><strong>Rudy Concepcion</strong></a>; <b><i>Madaling Araw</i></b> (Break of Dawn), 1938, with Elsa Oria, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4616\"><strong>Ely Ramos</strong></a>, Yolanda Marquez, and Ernesto La Guardia; and <b><i>Dalisay</i></b> (Chaste), 1939, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4720\"><strong>Fely Vallejo</strong></a>, Rogelio de la Rosa, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4572\"><strong>Corazon Noble</strong></a>. SPI also made melodramas with actors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4418\"><strong>Tita Duran</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4560\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\"><strong>Rosario Moreno</strong></a></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4581\"><strong>Carlos Padilla</strong></a>, Miguel Anzures, Pedro Faustino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4251\"><strong>Rosa Aguirre</strong></a>, Nanding Anzures, Flor de Jazmin, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4421\"><strong>Angel Esmeralda</strong></a>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the end of 1939, SPI &ldquo;pirated&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\"><strong>Carmen Rosales</strong></a>, the new contract star of its rival studio, Excelsior Pictures, to launch the biggest box-office love team of the next three decades, Carmen Rosales and Rogelio de la Rosa. Their initial movie, <b><i>Takip-silim </i></b>(Twilight), 1939, was followed by <b><i>Se&ntilde;orita</i></b> (Young Mistress), <b><i>Lambingan</i></b> (Romance), and <b><i>Colegiala</i></b> (Coed), all in 1940; <b><i>Panambitan</i></b> (Lament) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2303\"><strong>Tampuhan</strong></a></i></b> (Lovers&rsquo; Quarrel), 1941; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a></i></b> (Will You Remember), 1954; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1012\"><strong>Ang Tangi Kong Pag-ibig</strong></a></i></b> (My Only Love), 1955.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The studio did not function from 1942 to 1945 because of World War II, but resumed operations in 1946 under Judge Jose O. Vera after its president Rep Pedro Vera died. It produced Gerardo de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i>So Long, America</i></b>, 1946, and <b><i>Isumpa Mo, Giliw</i></b> (Make a Vow, My Love), 1947. In 1951, SPI suffered a setback when the studio was gutted by a big fire that destroyed all its master negatives.

Movie outfits he worked for include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\"><strong>Filippine Films</strong></a>, for whom he directed <b><i>Mag-inang Mahirap</i></b><i> </i>(Destitute Mother and Child), 1934; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\"><strong>Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</strong></a> under which he directed <b><i>Lagablab ng Kabataan</i></b><i> </i>(The Raging Fire of Youth), 1936, and <b><i>Hiram na Ligaya</i></b><i> </i>(Borrowed Happiness), 1937; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> Pictures, where he directed <b><i>Dalisay</i></b><i> </i>(Chaste), 1939, and<b><i> Tarhata</i></b>,<i> </i>1941; and LVN, for which he made the most number of movies, among them the first Filipino color movie, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1115\"><strong>Batalyon XIII</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(13th Battalion), 1949, <b><i>Edong Mapangarap </i></b>(Edong the Dreamer),<i> </i>1950, and <b><i>Mucho Dinero </i></b>(Plenty of Money),<i> </i>1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Silos&rsquo;s <b><i>Biyaya ng Lupa</i></b><i> </i>won the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences Best Picture and Best Story (Celso Carunungan) awards in 1960. It also won Best Supporting Actor award for Leroy Salvador at the 1960 Asian Film Festival. He was a recipient of the Natatanging Gawad Urian in 1979.

Echague, Isabela 12 Feb 1913. Movie sound engineer. Smith, considered the first Filipino sound recording engineer, was born of a Thomasite father and a Filipina. He married Lourdes Souza, and together they put up the Smith Sound System Laboratories in San Juan, Metro Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">While still in his teens, Smith was employed by Lyric Film Exchange to install sound equipment in theaters in the Philippines and Indonesia. His first movie was also Philippine cinema&rsquo;s first talking picture, <b><i>Ang Aswang</i></b><i> </i>(The Aswang), 1932, produced by George Musser. The knowledge that he gained from working with American technicians was immediately applied to local movies when he transferred to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\"><strong>Filippine Films</strong></a> in 1933. He formed a &ldquo;Four Plus <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>&rdquo; team with the Silos brothers Manuel, Octavio, Cesar, and Augusto, in handling the technical aspects of film production for such movies as <b><i>Mag-inang Mahirap</i></b><i> </i>(Destitute Mother and Child), <b><i>X-R-X</i></b>, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> ng Bilanggo</i></b><i> </i>(The Convict&rsquo;s Son), all released in 1934. He then set up the sound department of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\"><strong>Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</strong></a>, which made <b><i>Diwata ng Karagatan</i></b><i> </i>(Goddess of the Sea), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a> ng mga Ulila</i></b><i> </i>(Song of the Orphans), and <b><i>Sa Paanan ng Krus</i></b><i> </i>(At the Foot of the Cross), all in 1936. Together with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4574\"><strong>Luis F. Nolasco</strong></a>, he chose the site for the studio of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> Pictures, a noise-free rolling terrain on Gilmore Avenue, New Manila, where he later set up the first Reeves black-and-white processing and optical sound laboratory. This assured the tonal quality of Sampaguita&rsquo;s pioneering musicals, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\"><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></a></strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Beautiful Star), 1937; <b><i>Paroparong Bukid</i></b><i> </i>(Country Butterfly), and <b><i>Madaling Araw</i></b> (Break of Dawn), 1938; and other films. Shortly before the outbreak of World War II, he helped set up the sound studio of Excelsior Films, which produced <b><i>Arimunding-Munding</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1311\"><strong>Tunay na Ina</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Real Mother), 1939. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">During the war, Smith served in the United States Army corps of engineers but was captured by the enemy and detained in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a>. He was released in 1944 to work on the Japanese propaganda movie <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/676\"><strong>Tatlong Maria</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Three Marys), directed by Abe Yutaka and Gerardo de Leon. After the war, he produced <b><i>Si Malakas at si Maganda</i></b><i> </i>(The Strong and the Beautiful), 1947, starring Rosa del Rosario and Tony Benroy. He shot the film in Hollywood using 16mm Kodachrome (color reversal), which was later blown up to 35mm Ansco color for theatrical release. To do this, he had to maintain a balance of color temperature and exposure all throughout the filming so that the picture could be blown up effectively using only one light and one filter change. The success of his experiment won him recognition in the worldwide publication <b><i>International Photographer</i></b>,<i> </i>and it was said that Smith&rsquo;s innovative technique was subsequently adapted by Walt Disney for his African wildlife series.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Smith worked on LVN&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1115\"><strong>Batalyon XIII</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(13th Battalion), 1949, the first Filipino movie in 35mm filmed entirely in color. He helped set up the LVN Color Laboratory, which had serviced the industry since 1951. He pioneered in the reduction of local films from 35mm to 16mm format for showing on TV and noncommercial venues through mobile projectors. Toward the early 1960s, he helped popularize magnetic film recording. Smith helped train many of the industry&rsquo;s present crop of sound technicians, cinematographers, editors, and laboratory film technicians.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Smith was conferred the Natatanging Gawad Urian for his outstanding contribution to Philippine cinema by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\"><strong>Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</strong></a> in 1985. In 1987 he received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Film Academy of the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byAgustin Sotto and Lena S.

Realizing the difficulty in permeating an industry already dominated by bigger and older film studios, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\"><strong>Regal Films</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\"><strong>Viva Films</strong></a>, the production outfit needed a hands-on type of management that could unite its growing staff. Under the leadership of Malou Santos, who worked with the company as a manager and executive producer, Star Cinema began to prosper. It now enjoys its status as the most financially successful film production outfit in the Philippines. This became possible through Santos&rsquo;s efforts at building partnerships with other production companies, ensuring its productivity as a center of manpower, and producing films that not only promise income but elevate local filmmaking standards as well, thereby helping the country gain a spot in the international film arena. At present, the films released by Star Cinema are screened in Asia, North America, and Europe, forging the creation of new markets. Through this exposure, the company is also able to contribute to the continuing presence of the Philippines in the international scene.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.15pt\">Among the most memorable films that Star Cinema produced through the years are <b><i>May Minamahal </i></b>(<b><i>Loving Someone</i></b>), 1993; <b><i>Minsan Lang Kitang Iibigan </i></b>(I Will Love You Only Once), <b><i>Separada </i></b>(Separated Woman), and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1464\"><strong>Maalaala Mo Kaya</strong></a>: The Movie </i></b>(Will You Remember: The Movie), 1994; <b><i>Patayin sa Sindak si Barbara </i></b>(Kill Barbara with Fright) and <b><i>Sarah &hellip; Ang Munting Prinsesa </i></b>(Sarah &hellip; The Little Princess), 1995; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1219\"><strong>Madrasta</strong></a> </i></b>(Stepmother) and <b><i>Cedie</i></b>, 1996; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1116\"><strong>Batang PX</strong></a></i></b> (Phil-American Boy), <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1449\"><strong>Ipaglaban Mo</strong></a>: The Movie II</i></b><i> </i>(Fight for It: The Movie 2), and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1209\"><strong>Ang Lalaki sa Buhay ni Selya</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Man in Her Life</i></b>), 1997; <b><i>Bata, Bata &hellip; Paano Ka Ginawa? </i></b>(<b><i>Lea&rsquo;s Story</i></b>), 1998; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1524\"><strong>Wansapanataym</strong></a></i></b> (Once upon a Time) and <b><i>Esperanza: The Movie</i></b>, 1999; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\"><strong>Anak</strong></a></strong></a> </i></b>(The Child) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1297\"><strong>Tanging Yaman</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>A Change of Heart</i></b>), 2000; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1313\"><strong>La Vida Rosa</strong></a></i></b> (The Life of Rosa) and <b><i>Bagong Buwan </i></b>(<b><i>New Moon</i></b>), 2001; <b><i>Kailangan Kita </i></b>(I Need You), <b><i>American Adobo</i></b>, and <b><i>Dekada &rsquo;70 </i></b>(The 1970s), 2002; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1161\"><strong>Feng Shui</strong></a></i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1234\"><strong>Milan</strong></a></i></b>, 2004; <b><i>Dubai </i></b>and <b><i>Nasaan Ka Man </i></b>(Wherever You Are), 2005; <b><i>Sukob</i></b> (The Wedding Curse) and <b><i>Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo</i></b> (Partner, Participant, Partaker), 2006; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> More Chance</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Sakal, Sakali, Saklolo</i></b> (Strangle, Perchance, Help), 2007; <b><i>Caregiver </i></b>and <b><i>A Very Special Love</i></b>, 2008;<b> <i>I Love You, Goodbye </i></b>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1191\"><strong>In My Life</strong></a></i></b>, 2009; <b><i>Here Comes the Bride</i></b> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1274\"><strong>RPG Metanoia</strong></a></i></b>, 2010; <b><i>Bulong</i></b><i> </i>(Whisper) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1248\"><strong>No Other Woman</strong></a></i></b>, 2011; <b><i>The Healing</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>The Mistress</i></b>, 2012; and <b><i>A Moment in Time</i></b> and <b><i>On the Job</i></b>, 2013.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.15pt\">Many of the films made by Star Cinema have been recognized by award-giving bodies like the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences, Gawad Urian, Film Academy of the Philippines, and Star Awards. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Johann Vladimir J.

Its first production in 1961 teamed up <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a> Jr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4747\"><strong>Zaldy Zshornack</strong></a> in <b><i>Kilabot sa Barilan</i></b><i> </i>(Gunfight Terror). This was followed by similar movies from 1961 to 1963: <b><i>Ikaw o Ako</i></b><i> </i>(You or I), with Fernando Poe Jr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4723\"><strong>Romeo Vasquez</strong></a>; <b><i>Baril sa Baril</i></b><i> </i>(Gun to Gun), with Fernando Poe Jr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a>; and a combination of action stars in <b><i>Mga Tigreng Taga-Bukid</i></b><i> </i>(Tigers from the Countryside) and <b><i>Ang Dakilang Siyam</i></b><i> </i>(The Great Nine). By 1964, TIIP had introduced new action stars in the persons of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4501\"><strong>Jess Lapid</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4435\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\"><strong>Tony Ferrer</strong></a></strong></a>. Lapid made his mark in films like <b><i>Kardong Kidlat</i></b><i> </i>(Lightning Kardo) and <b><i>Suicide Commandos</i></b>,<i> </i>while Ferrer rose to prominence in <b><i>Sabotage</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Dial 717</i></b>.<i> </i>His role of superagent was derived from the popularity of the James Bond pictures of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">TIIP is likewise remembered for giving <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a> her big break as teen star when it paired her with singer-actor Edgar Mortiz in <b><i>My Pledge of Love</i></b>, 1970.<i> </i>The love team rivaled the popularity of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>&ndash;Tirso Cruz III tandem during this period. TIIP also gave Santos her first successful solo movies with the revival of the popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\"><strong>Mars Ravelo</strong></a> superheroines in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1156\"><strong>Dyesebel</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1973, and <b><i>Lipad, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/135\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong></a>, Lipad</i></b><i> </i>(Fly, Darna, Fly), 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In later years, TIIP slowed down on movie production, bowing to the competition of rival producers who owned theaters and had a ready circuit for their pictures. Nevertheless, it is credited with having assisted the major stars like Fernando Poe Jr, Joseph Estrada, and Vilma Santos in forming their own movie companies. TIIP president Laxa subsequently became director-general of the Film Academy of the Philippines.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Mauro Tumbocon Jr</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

When the famous comedy team of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a> and Togo transferred to another theater, the Star hired Torrente and his partner, Totong Rosales, to take their place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">His movie career began in 1939 with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\"><strong>Lamberto V.

He rose to become the country&rsquo;s top special effects artist and made his mark in films such as <b><i>Sunset over Corregidor</i></b>,<i> </i>1947; <b><i>Isang Dakot na Bigas</i></b><i> </i>(A Handful of Rice), 1948; <b><i>Kumander Sundang</i></b><i> </i>(Commander Bolo),<i> </i>1949; <b><i>Kulog sa Tag-Araw</i></b><i> </i>(Thunder in Summer), 1950; and <b><i>Cry Freedom</i></b>,<i> </i>1959.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Though he was adept at creating special effects for fantasy films, his specialty was the creation of war effects for action pictures: exploding bombs and artillery shells, advancing tanks, ricocheting bullets, burning cities, explosions. He did the battle scenes and special effects of Hollywood films shot in the Philippines, such as <b><i>Surrender Hell</i></b>,<i> <b>Merrill&rsquo;s Marauders</b></i>,<i> <b>Huk, Blackburn&rsquo;s Guerrillas</b></i>,<i> </i>and <b><i>Marco Polo</i></b>.<i> </i>He also supplied various movie companies with costumes, sets, props, makeup artists, and stuntmen whom he personally trained and supervised.

Since 2003, the company produced four award-winning feature films, all graded &ldquo;A&rdquo; by the Cinema Evaluation Board: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1141\"><strong>Crying Ladies</strong></a></i></b>, 2003; <b><i>Santa Santita </i></b>(<b><i>Magdalena</i></b>), 2004; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1315\"><strong>La Visa Loca</strong></a> </i></b>(Crazy Visa), 2005; and <b><i>I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila! </i></b>(I Do Bidoo Bidoo: The APO Is Here!),<i> </i>2012.

Straight Shooters became one of the most successful and sought-after production companies in the country and region. As the company branches out into content, the business of producing television commercials is maintained. The company did work for all the major advertising agencies, such as McCann Worldwide Group, JWT, Jimenez Basic, Lowe, Y&amp;R, and BBDO.Straight Shooters is also the go-to production house for regional productions as a line producer. It produced projects for various countries such as India, Malaysia, Thailand, United States, and United Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unitel and Straight Shooters are staffed with highly creative teams of producers and directors.

He coached Rosa del Rosario in her Tagalog speaking lines so that she could effectively portray the role of the rape victim in an incestuous relationship, as the daughter of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4432\"><strong>Gregorio Fernandez</strong></a> in <b><i>Taong Demonyo</i></b><i> </i>(Demon Man), 1937. He cast a relatively unknown <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\"><strong>Carmen Rosales</strong></a> over the protests of his producers and made her a big star in <b><i>Arimunding-Munding</i></b>,<i> </i>1939. He changed the name of Sigrid von Guiese to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4587\"><strong>Paraluman</strong></a> and motivated her to render an unforgettable performance in the dying scene of <b><i>La Paloma</i></b><i> </i>(The Dove), 1947. Among the screen luminaries whose careers he helped launch in his films are Rosita Rivera in <b><i>Ilaw ng Langit</i></b><i> </i>(Light of Heaven), 1937; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4445\"><strong>Arsenia Francisco</strong></a> in <b><i>Azucena</i></b>,<i> </i>1939; Luningning in <b><i>Ang Lihim ng Lumang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>Simbahan</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(The Secret of the Old Church), 1940; Serafin Garcia in <b><i>Sa Duyan ng Pagmamahal</i></b><i> </i>(Love&rsquo;s Hammock), 1940; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4513\"><strong>Mona Lisa</strong></a> in <b><i>Tinangay ng Apoy </i></b>(Taken by Fire),<i> </i>1940; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4611\"><strong>Tessie Quintana</strong></a> in <b><i>Paraluman</i></b><i> </i>(Muse),<i> </i>1941. It was also <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4731\"><strong>Tor Villano</strong></a>&rsquo;s picture that first made audiences sit up and give notice to an outstanding love team, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4418\"><strong>Tita Duran</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\"><strong>Pancho Magalona</strong></a> in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/884\"><strong>Dahil sa Iyo</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Because of You), 1948.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other important films directed by Villano that have left lasting imprints on the memories of his viewers are <b><i>Cadena de Amor </i></b>(Chain of Love),<i> </i>1940; <b><i>Kung Kita&rsquo;y Kapiling</i></b><i> </i>(When We&rsquo;re Together) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/555\"><strong>Halimaw</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Monster), 1941; <b><i>Simbahang Pawid</i></b><i> </i>(Nipa Church) and <b><i>Amapola</i></b>,<i> </i>1948; and <b><i>Damit Pangkasal</i></b><i> </i>(Wedding Gown), 1949. He also made two pre-World War II films at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\"><strong>LVN Pictures</strong></a> like <b><i>Patawad</i></b><i> </i>(Pardon), starring Purita Santamaria and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4361\"><strong>Reynaldo Dante</strong></a>, and <b><i>Nag-iisang Sangla</i></b><i> </i>(The Only Pawn), starring Mila del Sol and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\"><strong>Leopoldo Salcedo</strong></a>, both in 1940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1982 Villano received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan Award from the city of Manila for his achievement in film, citing, among others, his contributions to the upliftment of Filipino moral values in his works. Ten years later, at the 1991 Metro Manila Film Festival, he received a Plaque of Recognition for his meritorious achievements in film. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Lena S.

Many Vicor records were selling movies via their theme songs, and box-office titles of hit songs meant higher record sales. For Viva&rsquo;s first movie project, he signed up Vicor&rsquo;s biggest recording star, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a>, and young matinee idol <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4342\"><strong>Gabby Concepcion</strong></a>, and wove a romantic tale around the song <b><i>P.S.
