This genre is of two types: those based on <b>true-to-life stories</b> or stories about real persons and actual events, and those based on completely <b>fictional stories</b>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">True-to-life stories may be based on the lives of real persons, such as <b><i>Asedillo</i></b>,<i> </i>1971, which focuses on a schoolteacher-turned-rebel who leads discontented elements against landlords and bureaucrats during the American colonial period; and <b><i>Nardong Putik</i></b>,<i> </i>1972, which depicts Cavite&rsquo;s &ldquo;Robin Hood&rdquo; character who protects helpless peasants from powerful carabao rustlers. Those based on actual events include <b><i><strong>Maliw</strong> alu Massacre</i></b>,<i> </i>1964, which describes the brutal massacre of peasants suspected of being Huk sympathizers in Central Luzon in the early 1960s; and <b><i>Hostage: Hanapin si Batuigas </i></b>(Hostage: Get Batuigas), 1977, which chronicles the exploits of a well-known police reporter, Ruther Batuigas, who negotiates the release of a family being held hostage by goons. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Action films that are based on fictional stories may deal with contemporary or familiar issues, such as <b><i>Ang Pumatay nang <strong>Dahil sa Iyo</strong> </i></b>(To Kill for You), 1989, which examines the evils of the American military presence in the Philippines; and <b><i>Bagong Hari </i></b>(New King), 1986, which focuses on small-town politics and the vicious battle for supremacy between rival groups vying for the governor&rsquo;s office. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Many prewar action films exploited the peace-and-order campaigns of the Philippine Constabulary (PC) under American rule. <b><i>Pugad ng <strong>Aguila</strong> </i></b>(Eagle&rsquo;s Nest), 1938, focuses on the pursuit of the fugitive Teodoro Asedillo in the Sierra Madre mountains, while <b><i>Datu Talim</i></b>,<i> </i>1940, tells of the PC expedition to quell a Muslim revolt in Mindanao. In <b><i>Punit na Bandila </i></b>(Torn Flag), 1939, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\">Fernando Poe</a> heads a PC contingent to Davao to place the notorious Muslim leader Ali Mudin under government control after he tears up the Philippine flag and burns a village.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">After 1945, most Filipino action films depicted the ex-soldier or the &ldquo;guerrilla&rdquo; fighter who came home from the war, as personified by Fernando Poe in <b><i>Dugo ng Bayan </i></b>(<b><i>I Remember Bataan</i></b>), 1946; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\">Leopoldo Salcedo</a> in <b><i>Kaaway ng Bayan </i></b>(Public Enemy), 1947; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4582\">Jose Padilla Jr</a> in <b><i><strong>Halik</strong> sa Bandila </i></b>(A Kiss to the Flag), 1948; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4628\">Efren Reyes</a> in <b><i>Kumander Sundang </i></b>(Commander Bolo), 1949; and <strong> </strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4555\">Fred Montilla</a> in <b><i>Takas sa Bataan </i></b>(Escape from Bataan), 1950. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In the 1960s and 1970s, Filipino action films were heavily influenced by foreign models, like <b><i>Rebel without a Cause</i></b>, 1955,<b> </b>with James Dean, which gave rise to the Low Waist Gang movies; the John Wayne cowboy films, as well as the Django series, also known as spaghetti Westerns, which were copied by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4501\">Jess Lapid</a> movies such as <b><i>Ito ang Lalake </i></b>(This Is a Man), 1964; the James Bond movies, as seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4435\">Tony Ferrer</a> films like <b><i>Sabotage</i></b>, 1966; gangster films like <b><i>The Godfather</i></b>,<i> </i>1972, which inspired movies like <b><i>D&rsquo;Godson</i></b>,<i> </i>1983; and martial arts or Kung Fu movies from Hong Kong and Taiwan, which launched the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4744\">Ramon Zamora</a> movies, like <b><i>Dalmacio Armas</i></b>,<i> </i>1983. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">From the 1960s to the 1970s, Fernando Poe Jr dominated the action genre films that depicted him as champion of the oppressed. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4626\">Ramon Revilla</a>, who started out as a boy-next-door type at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, acquired a new image as an action star when he went freelance in <b><i>Nardong Putik</i></b>,<i> </i>1972, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4433\">Rudy Fernandez</a>, also a Sampaguita &ldquo;pretty boy&rdquo; contract star, turned from lover boy to convict roles in <b><i>Bitayin si Baby Ama </i></b>(Execute Baby Ama), 1976.

Salvador became known for his roles in <b><i>Gabi Na, Kumander </i></b>(It&rsquo;s Nighttime, Commander), 1986; <b><i>Balweg</i></b>, 1987; <b><i>Afuang: Bounty Hunter</i></b>, 1988; <b><i>Boy Negro</i></b>, 1988; and <b><i>Kumander Dante </i></b>(Commander Dante), 1988.

Robin Padilla rose to stardom in 1990 with the films <b><i>Barumbado</i></b> (Troublemaker), <b><i>Bad Boy</i></b>, and <b><i>Anak ni Baby Ama </i></b>(Son of Baby Ama). Cesar Montano gained popularity in <b><i>Alyas Waway </i></b>(Alias Waway), 1993; <b><i>Sanggano</i></b> (Hoodlum), 1997; and <b><i>Bullet</i></b>, 1999, among his other films. Other films made in the 1990s were <b><i>Walang Awa Kung Pumatay</i></b> (Merciless Killer), 1990; <b><i>Mabuting Kaibigan, Masamang Kaaway</i></b> (Good Friend, Bad Enemy), 1991; <b><i>Grease Gun Gang</i></b>, 1992; <b><i>Masahol Pa sa Hayop</i></b> (Worse Than a Beast), 1993; <b><i>Paghihiganti Ko Tapos Ka Na!</i></b> (When I Get Back You Are Done!), 1994; <b><i>Dog Tag: Kamay ng Katarungan</i></b> (Dog Tag: Hand of Justice), 1995; <b><i>Bilang Na ang Araw Mo</i></b> (Your Days Are Numbered), 1996; <b><i>Padre Kalibre</i></b> (Father Caliber), 1997; <b><i>Wangbu</i></b> (Nuts), 1998; and <b><i>Alyas Pogi: Ang Pagbabalik</i></b> (Alias Handsome: The Return), 1999.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In the 2000s and 2010s, the production of action movies slowed down because of the high cost of filming and the competition from foreign films, which had very sophisticated effects. Moreover, many action stars shifted to other genres, such as drama and comedy. Among the action films produced during these decades were <b><i>Testigo</i></b> (Witness), 2000, with Zoren Legaspi; <b><i>Ex-con</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2000, with Victor Neri; and <b><i>Ping Lacson: Super Cop</i></b>, 2000,<b> </b>with Rudy Fernandez; <b><i>Kaaway Hanggang Hukay</i></b> (Enemy until Death), 2001, with Phillip Salvador; <b><i>Aagos ang Dugo</i></b> (Blood Will Be Shed), 2001, with Gardo Verzosa; <b><i>Hari ng Selda: Anak ni Baby Ama</i></b> (Prison King: Son of Baby Ama), 2002, with Robin Padilla; <b><i>Mano Mano: Arnis the Lost Art</i></b>, 2004, with Ronnie Ricketts; <b><i><strong>Batas Militar</strong> </i></b> (Martial Law), 2006, with Mark Lapid; <b><i>Rumble Boy</i></b>, 2007,<b><i> </i></b>with Derek Dee; <b><i>Alfredo S.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">An <b>animation film</b> is a film that makes photographed drawings or inanimate images come to life. The essence of animation is to give the illusion of lifelike movement through single-frame photography. To achieve movement, a series of drawings arranged in succession, each one slightly changed from the one before it, are photographed frame by frame at an average of three frames or more per photo, depending on the desired rhythm. When these series of shots are run on 18 or 24 frames per second in the movie projector, an illusion of lifelike movement is created. This is due to the principle of &ldquo;persistence of vision,&rdquo; where the eye retains the impression of an image for about one-tenth of a second after the image has been removed. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Types of <strong>Ani</strong>mation</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">There are two types of animation: <b>drawn animation</b> and <b>stop-motion animation</b>. Drawn animation employs drawings to make an image move. The medium may be cel or acetate animation using acrylic colors. On each separate sheet of cel, every single movement requires the drawing of a new image. The animated cartoons of Walt Disney shown in the Philippines, such as <b><i>Pinocchio</i></b>, 1940,<i> </i>and <b><i>Sleeping Beauty</i></b>,<i> </i>1959, are the best examples of this type. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The stop-motion animation technique refers to the use of any physical object or being whose movements are shot frame by frame in front of or under a camera. This includes cutout animation, which utilizes flat characters, props, and backgrounds cut out from any material such as paper, cardboard, photo, or fabric; pixillation, which involves live actors; model animation, which requires three-dimensional figures or puppets using wire, cloth, wood, or rubber latex; and clay animation, which primarily uses modeling clay. An example of this is the short satire of brothers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4255\">Mike and Juan Alcazaren</a> entitled <b><i>Hari</i></b> (King), 1982, which revolves around the power struggle of several characters fighting over the ownership of a crow.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In mainstream cinema, animation is used for special effects, as seen in films like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\">Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></a> </i></b>(Adarna Bird), 1941, or<i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1263\"><b><strong>Ang Panday</strong> </b></a> </i>(The Blacksmith), 1980. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">History of <strong>Animation</strong> in the Philippines</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Animation came to the Philippines a few months before World War II as a special-effects support to the film <b><i><strong> <strong><strong>Ibong Adarna</strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> in 1941. It was not until the arrival of television and its first telecast in the country in 1953 that animation was used to advertise consumer products. It was also in the same year that <i>komiks</i> illustrator and cartoonist Lauro &ldquo;Larry&rdquo; Alcala did a short black-and-white exercise on 8mm film of a girl jumping rope and a boy playing with a yo-yo. In 1955, Jose Zaballa Santos and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3735\"><strong>Francisco Reyes</strong></a> made <b><i>Juan Tamad</i></b> (Lazy Juan), a six-minute ad for Purico cooking oil, based on the famous Philippine folklore character. Other cartoonists who are also considered animation pioneers include Jeremias Elizalde Navarro and Vicente Pe&ntilde;etrante, but most prolific and notable among them is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3651\"><strong>Severino &ldquo;Nonoy&rdquo; Marcelo</strong></a>. He did a seven-minute animated clip for the film <b><i>Annie Batungbakal</i></b> in 1974 and the pilot episode of <b><i><strong>Tadhana</strong> </i></b> (Destiny), which was initially conceptualized as a TV series that sought to teach the nation&rsquo;s history from the perspective of the Marcos administration. The 48-minute feature was aired over RPN 9 in 1978 and was considered the very first feature-length cel animation in the Philippines. During this period, animation was also largely used as a political tool. Marcelo was commissioned to do animation projects for the Green Revolution education series, with episodes like tilapia raising and bee farming, and for the national youth organization Kabataang Barangay (Youth League) headed by Marcos&rsquo;s eldest child, Imee. Later, Marcelo did a 60-minute feature, <b><i>Biag ni <strong>Lam-ang</strong> </i></b> (Life of Lam-ang), 1979, recounting the adventures and misadventures of the Ilocano epic hero.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In 1986, Gerardo A. Garcia (aka Geirry Garcia) established GAGAVEP and produced the very first animated TV series <b><i>Ang Panday</i></b>, based on the komiks serial of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4312\">Carlo J. Caparas</a>. It lasted for six months after its first broadcast on RPN 9. Another work that utilized the traditional animation technique was <b><i>Sa Paligid-ligid</i></b> (Everywhere), a two-hour animation special on environmental awareness and conservation, produced by the company behind the popular children&rsquo;s TV show <b><i><strong>Bati</strong> bot</i></b> (Little Tots) and aired over IBC 13 in 1989. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Many more works that applied different animation techniques were produced in the 1980s. Most were animated shorts, like the Alcazaren brothers&rsquo; <b><i>Huling Trip</i></b> (Last Trip), 1983, a forward look into the radioactive age when survival comes down to eating one another; <b><i>Headset</i></b>, 1983, a comical tale of a man with a headset that produces rock music; and <b><i>Pagpula</i></b> (Becoming Red), 1984, which serves as a social and political commentary; Joey and Roby Agbayani&rsquo;s <b><i>The Eye in the Sky</i></b>, 1984, a science-fiction short featuring a boy who looks into a microscope to discover a new world of strange living creatures, without him knowing that a bigger eye watches over him from the sky; Nonoy Dadivas, Fruto Corre, Pablo Biglang-awa Jr, and Alfonso Ponce&rsquo;s <b><i>The Criminal</i></b>, 1984, which tells the story of a fugitive who cannot escape from himself; Monlee and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4655\">Roxlee</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Great Smoke</i></b>, 1985, a satirical approach to the effects of nuclear war on the human race; and Roxlee, Benjie Lontoc Jr, Yeye Calderon, and At Maculangan&rsquo;s <b><i>Spit/Words and Outtakes/Optik</i></b>, 1989, which features a character who spits then transforms into different personas and interacts with various illustrations. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In 1995, Gerardo Garcia collaborated with Mike Relon Makiling in directing <b><i>Isko: Adventures in Animasia</i></b>, which is a live-action film with a 30-minute animation sequence, produced by OctoArts International. Garcia later did his first full-length animated feature, <b><i>Adarna: The Mythical Bird</i></b>, which was produced by Guiding Light Production and FLT Films International, and was an entry in the 1997 Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF). In 1996, the traditional animation technique was also utilized in the short film <b><i>Vexations</i></b> by Juan Alcazaren.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The advent of digital technology has seen the rise of using computer equipment and software in making <b>2D</b> and <b>3D animations</b>, which greatly reduces the cost and time of animation production. Animation enhancement technologies, such as stereoscopic 3D and motion capture or &ldquo;mo-cap,&rdquo; have also been developed to create more fluid movements and photorealistic animation in high detail. In 2002, ArtFarm Asia Animation produced the trilogy <b><i>Kuwentong Kayumanggi</i></b> ( <strong>Stories</strong> from the Malay Race), which is based on myths and legends from each of the country&rsquo;s major island groups. In 2008, two full-length animated features were released: namely, <b><i>Urduja</i></b>, which employs the traditional animation technique and follows the story of the legendary warrior princess; and <b><i>Dayo: Sa Mundo ng Elementalia</i></b> (<b><i>The Wanderer in the Land of Elementalia</i></b>), which combines 2D and 3D computer animation techniques and is regarded as the country&rsquo;s first fully digital animated film. It premiered in the 2008 MMFF and follows the adventure of young Bubuy into the underworld to save his grandparents. In 2010, another milestone in Philippine animation was made when Ambient Media, Thaumatrope Animation, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a> produced the country&rsquo;s first full-length 3D animated film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1274\"><strong>RPG Metanoia</strong></a></i></b>. It opened in the 2010 MMFF and presents the story of 11-year-old Nico as he searches for his true strength in the online and offline worlds and discovers the hero within him.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Over the years, <b>digital animation</b> has become more accessible and paved the way for several independent animation professionals and production groups to produce their original animated content. For example, Nelson &ldquo;Blog&rdquo; Caliguia Jr published a comic strip called <b><i>Inday Wanda</i></b> in 2004 and turned this into a nine-minute film in 2007. Later, TV5 and Unitel Productions adapted the prizewinning work for a live-action TV series, which premiered on 6 Sep 2010. Caliguia did another award-winning animated short using traditional method but rendered digitally called <b><i>Mutya</i></b> (Princess) in 2009. The independent group Tuldok Animation Studios Inc produced the 40-minute <b><i>Pasintabi </i></b>(Excuse), 2010, which mixes Flash and 3D computer animation techniques. Other acclaimed short works include Niko Salazar&rsquo;s <b><i>Marianing</i></b>, 2012; Omar <strong>Aguila</strong> r&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Lalong ni Kulakog</i></b> (Kulakog&rsquo;s Rooster), 2013; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5062\">Arnold Arre</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Milky Boy</i></b>, 2013, and <b><i>Lakas ng Lahi</i></b> (<b><i>Blood Compact</i></b>), 2014.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">The Animation Industry</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">The growth of animation as an industry in the Philippines started when the Marcos regime used subcontracting work and cheap labor as a way of attracting foreign businesses to the country. Burbank Animation Inc from Australia was the first to set up an offshore studio in 1983. The following year, Filipino filmmaker Chito Ro&ntilde;o established Optifex International, which later became AsianAnimation. Artist poaching between these two companies soon led to their demise in 1988. Hanna-Barbera arrived in the Philippines in 1986 and hired a studio to service its animation requirements in the United States, but it eventually put up a subsidiary under the name Fil-Cartoons in 1988. The country&rsquo;s unstable economic situation ultimately ended its operations toward the mid-1990s. Some of the bigger animation companies that remain to be major players in the industry are Toei Animation Philippines Inc, a 100 percent subsidiary of Toei Animation Co. Ltd. from Japan, which was formed through a partnership agreement with the construction company Engineering Equipment Inc in 1986; Philippine Animation Studio Inc, the animation arm of Astro All Asia Networks from Malaysia since 1991; and Toon City Animation Inc, which began as the traditional animation service provider of Walt Disney Television Animation in 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">During these booming years, the Board of Investments classified the animation sector under the petroleum industry because of the oil-based paint used in traditional animation. The industry classification was necessary because it provided tax breaks to companies that needed to import animation materials. These incentives also encouraged the businesses to stay and entice more of them to invest in the industry to propel its development. Even if many small and medium animation enterprises that mostly provide animation services to other countries continued to flourish, it was not until the late 1990s, when the business process outsourcing (now information technology and business process management [IT-BPM]) industry in the Philippines expanded to cover a wide range of sectors, that animation has formally been regarded as part of the non-voice IT-BPM sector, with the tax holidays still on offer. Even then, piracy of human resource was rampant and an unresolved issue. Efforts were made to unify the local industry and prevent labor cannibalization, such as the establishment of the Animation Producers&rsquo; Association of the Philippines (Animatia Philippines) in 1989. However, it only existed for several months due to lack of funds and commitment from the studio representatives. Exactly 11 years later, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) initiated another attempt to organize the animation sector. It finally bore fruit when the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4263\">Animation Council of the Philippines Inc</a> (ACPI) was officially founded as an association in 2000, which aimed to develop and promote the local animation industry in the global arena. Also, the sector later became part of the creative industry following the definition set by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Right from the beginning, programs from both government and nongovernment sectors played important roles in the progress of the country&rsquo;s animation industry. The initiative started with the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines holding an annual short film festival in 1982. The University of the Philippines Film Center followed by introducing an animation category in its 3rd Manila Short Film Festival in 1983. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) did the same when it organized the Gawad CCP para sa Alternatibong Pelikula at Video (CCPIndependent Film and Video Competition) in 1988. Soon enough, animation proceeded from being a category in film competitions to having its own festival. The Alternatibong Samahan ng mga Animator sa Pilipinas (Alternative Society of Animators in the Philippines), in cooperation with the Mowelfund Film Institute, spearheaded the first all-Filipino, noncompetitive animation festival called Animagination, where 49 original works were screened at the CCP in 1995. The festival had its second and last run in 1997. On the other hand, the Center for International Trade Expositions and Missions, DTI&rsquo;s export promotion arm, sponsored Animazing Shorts, an annual competition among budding animation artists duringthe e-Services Philippines: IT Outsourcing Conference and Exhibitionfrom 2003 to 2008. However, ACPI saw the need to have a more sustainable project that would discover and recognize new talents in animation through original content creation. Hence, ACPI launched its annual flagship project Animahenasyon Philippine Animation Festival in 2007 with the following components: competition for amateur and professional divisions, special screening, and conference. In 2013, the MMFF, in collaboration with ACPI, added the animation category to the New Wave section of its festival with the hope of reaching a wider audience.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4364\"><strong>Joel David</strong></a> and Lena S.

It found its way into mainstream cinema in the 1970s, and is distinct from the X-rated, hard-core pornography. The bomba was known under various names: <b>wet look</b>, <b>bold</b>, <b>ST</b> (sex trip), and <b>TF</b> (titillating film).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Foreign films shown in the Philippines in the 1960s and 1970s that influenced the bomba include the Marilyn Monroe movies, as well as the European films that starred Brigitte Bardot, Sophia Loren, An<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>i</strong></a>ta Ekberg, Raquel Welch, Gina Lollobrigida, and Claudia Cardinale. Sex-education movies from Denmark and Sweden were also important antecedents, as well as sex comedies from London, Italy, and France. The sexual revolution that swept Europe in the 1960s, partially stirred up by such films as Vilgot Sj&ouml;man&rsquo;s <b><i>I Am Curious</i> <i>(Yellow)</i></b>, 1967,<i> </i>helped pave the way for mainstream erotica and pornography in the country. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><b><i>Uhaw</i></b> (Thirst), 1970, ushered in the first bomba trend. The movie depicts several sexual encounters and is highlighted by a scene with Merle Fernandez running in the nude in a long shot. Aside from Merle Fernandez, the first generation of bomba stars included Divina Valencia, Rosanna Ortiz, Stella Suarez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4742\">Yvonne</a>, and Alona Alegre. Bomba film titles are often suggestive: <b><i>Gutom</i></b> (Hungry), <b><i>Sabik</i></b> (Eager), <b><i>Laman sa Laman</i></b> (Flesh on Flesh), <b><i>Hayok</i></b> (Starved). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Nympha</i></b> (Nymph), 1971, starring Rizza, was an important attempt to mix artistry and serious content in this genre. It dealt with abortion, a topic then considered taboo.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">The declaration of martial law in 1972 clamped down on bomba films as well as political movies critical of the Marcos administration. To avoid censorship, producers cashed in on a new type of bomba&mdash;the wet look. Bomba metamorphosed into bold movies&mdash;stars swim in their underwear, take a bath in their <i>camison</i> (chemise), or are chased and raped in a river, sea, or under a waterfall. A popular example is <b><i>Ang Pinakamagandang Hayop sa Balat ng Lupa</i></b> (The Most Beautiful Animal on the Face of the Earth), 1974, starring former Miss Universe Gloria Diaz and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4578\">Elizabeth Oropesa</a>. Other popular bold stars include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4725\">Vivian Velez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4647\">Chanda Romero</a>, Daria Ramirez, and younger newcomers like Alma Moreno, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4300\">Dina Bonnevie</a>, Rio Locsin, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4703\">Lorna Tolentino</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">When the Marcos regime established the Experimenta lCinema of the Philippines in 1982, it was exempted from censorship as long as the films were shown at the Manila Film Center. Bold &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; films like <b><i>Isla</i></b> (Island), <b><i>Boatman</i></b>, 1984, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1286\"><b><i>Scorpio Nights</i></b></a>, 1985, all of which showed explicit scenes of sexual intercourse as well as frontal nudity, were shown at the Manila Film Center. The batch of new bold stars included Isabel Lopez, Ana Marie Gutierrez, and a host of new discoveries picked up generally from nightclubs and modelling ramps. Some were named after soft drinks (e.g., Pepsi Paloma, Sarsi Emmanuelle, Coca Nicolas) and rich entrepreneurs (e.g., Claudia Zobel and Brandy Ayala).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Related to the bomba was the <b>penekula</b>, short for &quot;penetration&quot; and <i>pelikula</i> (film), which showed actual penetration between man and woman. This included outtakes that were shown in between main feature screenings. Later, penekula were shot in the form of hardcore pornography, which were circulated through Betamax or shown in movie houses. Popular penekula actors during this time were <strong> </strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4425\">George Estregan</a><strong> </strong> and Mark Joseph, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1980s, ST or sex trip movies, from the student lingo influenced by the drug culture (as in power trip, ego trip, food trip), became the vogue. The ST may be described as another brand of bold film. Here the female stars project the &ldquo;classy&rdquo; image of the well-bred <i>colegiala </i>(coed) from well-to-do families seeking thrills. Unlike their earlier counterparts who were innocent victims and barrio lasses, Gretchen Barretto, Rita Avila, and Rina Reyes were supposed to be intelligent, sexually liberated, and independent-minded females.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Following the ST trend of the 1980s came the TF or titillating films of the 1990s. Aya Medel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4637\">Rosanna Roces</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4545\">Glydel Mercado</a>, Priscilla Almeda, Amanda Page, Ina Raymundo, and Ara Mina were the new bold stars. The TF movies mixed the innocent and unschooled barrio young women with the educated college students and professionals. Obviously, the message is that these females are already fully conscious of their body and exercise their right to sexual pleasure. The problem in the end, however, is that they appear to be controlled by passion, act like vixens&mdash;and, in the eyes of men, are fit to be toyed with, undeserving of love. Or if ever these women do become truly loved, they have to transform themselves into subservient wives or mistresses. Some of the pop&shy;&shy;&shy;&shy;ular movies of this trend are <b><i>Basa sa Dagat</i></b> (Wet in the Sea), 1995;<b> <i>Patikim ng Pinya </i></b>(Let Me Taste the Pineapple), 1996;<i> <b><strong>Burlesk Queen</strong> Ngayon</b></i> (Burlesque Queen Today); and<i> <b>Sutla </b></i>(Silk), 1999.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The 21st century turned up with even more bold films, some of which were critically acclaimed, while others showed the usual run-of-the-mill potboilers. <b><i>Live Show</i></b>, 2000, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>, tells the stories of poverty-stricken people who perform sex acts for a living in front of a live audience. Other movies include <b><i>Madame X</i></b> and<b><i> Gigil </i></b>(Excitement), 2000;<b> <i>Bakat</i> </b>(Conspicuous),<b> <i>Tampisaw</i></b> (Frolic),<b> </b>and <b><i>Masarap ang Pugad</i> </b>(The Nest Is Luscious),<b> </b>2002; <b><i>Hiram</i> </b>(Borrowed),<b> </b>2003;<b><i> Silip </i></b>(Peek), 2007;<b> <i>Sex Drive</i> </b>and<b> <i><strong>One</strong> </i> <i>Night Only</i></b>, 2008<i>.</i> Among the new batch of stars willing to bare flesh were Rufa Mae Quinto, Diana Zubiri, Francine Prieto, Katrina Halili, Maui Taylor, Katya Santos, Klaudia Koronel, and Aleck Bovick.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Meanwhile, the emergence of digital equipment became accessible and gave rise to independent filmmaking. Part of this indie revolution was the production of films that exhibit both heterosexual and homosexual themes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4543\">Brillante Mendoza</a>&rsquo;s debut film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1229\"><strong>Masahista</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>The Masseur</i></b>), 2005, focuses on a young man who works as a masseur for gay men.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">A <b>dokyu</b> (documentary) is a film that records and interprets events or discusses factual subject matters&mdash;historical, political, religious, economic, social, cultural&mdash;with or without fictionalized treatment. A dokyu is a nonfiction film, but not all nonfiction films are documentaries. Some nonfiction films that are not documentaries are <b>film journalism</b>, the <b>general interest film</b>, and <b>nature films</b>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Film journalism is concerned with films of fact, such as newsreels. Such films stress timeliness and reportage. The general interest film tackles a subject principally for its informational value. The more common type is the <b>travelogue</b>, which seeks to inform viewers about the attractions of a place and its people. The nature film elicits knowledge and heightened sensory experience about the physical world. Films about the microscopic world, animal and plant life on earth, the solar system and the stars belong to the vast spectrum of nature films. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">A documentary not merely records news events or discusses factual subject matters but presents a particular perspective or argument about a specific subject. An example of historical documentary is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4601\">Ben Pinga</a>, Armando Medel, and Dominador Estanislao&rsquo;s<b><i> I Was a Trainee</i></b>, 1950, which examines the lives of young men drafted into the army. Later, Pinga produced the multi-awarded <b><i>Soul of a Fortress</i></b>, 1964, a poetic, postwar portrait of Corregidor, the bastion of freedom in the country during World War II. A documentary that tackles a social and economic problem is <b><i>The Grey Menace</i></b>, 1957, which is about the control of rodents in the ravaged fields of Mindanao. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Other documentaries present content with cultural themes. <b><i>La Fiesta de Obando</i></b> (The Feast of Obando), 1909, was made to highlight and record the folkways and culture of the Filipinos. Another example of a cultural documentary is the <b><i>Tuklas Sining</i></b> (Discovering Art) series of 28 videos and monographs, produced by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> from 1989 to 1993. The series traces and analyzes the history and traditions (ethnic, Hispanic, Anglo-American) of Filipino architecture, visual arts, dance, music, theater, literature, and film. Another example of a cultural documentary is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Nanette Matilac</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Pangalay: Ang Pagbabalik sa Tawi-Tawi </i></b>(Return to Tawi-Tawi), 2014, a portrait of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\">Ligaya Fernando-Amilbangsa</a> who has spent her life recording the <i>pangalay</i> and other dances in Tawi-Tawi. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Documentaries that tackle economic problems, like poverty, injustice, social deviance, and similar themes, constitute another major dokyu category. The filmmaker is in sympathy with or against the issue at stake and strives to make his film illuminate specific areas in order to provoke social concern among its viewers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Si Mang Anong</i></b>, 1954, presents the life story of a rice planter who becomes &ldquo;Farmer of the Year.&rdquo; <b><i>They Shall Not Want</i></b>, 1962, a film by Emeterio Ornedo, was entered in the Agricultural Film Competitions in Berlin. <b><i>The Land Is Free</i></b>, 1962, a documentary film by Fidel de Castro, presents the story of landless Filipinos who availed themselves of the benefits of the government&rsquo;s land reform program. It was cited in the Week of the Asian Film in Frankfurt in 1962. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Lupa </i></b>(Land), 1977, traces the political movements toward land reform from the early years of the Sakdal to the Hukbalahap to the presidency of Magsaysay up to the Marcos years. <b><i>Lupa</i></b> includes rare interviews with Salud Algabre, the <i>generala </i>of the Sakdal Movement, and Luis Taruc and Jesus Lava of the Hukbalahap Communist movement. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4443\">Joseph Fortin</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Children of the Lake</i></b>, 1983, about how a family in a lakeside village in Laguna copes with the changing times, uses the cinema direct approach and captures his subject as life unfolding before the camera. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a></i></b>, 1983, is about a female impersonator who performs in gay bars to support his family. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Another dokyu category explores political themes. <b><i>Ka Satur </i></b>(Comrade Satur), 1984, by Nona Ocampo is a stirring portrait of the filmmaker&rsquo;s father, Satur Ocampo, a journalist and political prisoner. <b><i>Revolutions Happen Like Refrains in a Song</i></b>, 1987, is Nick Deocampo&rsquo;s personal and political view of the 1986 EDSA Revolt. Filipino-American Marty Syjuco produced <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1170\"><strong>Give Up Tomorrow</strong></a></i></b>, 2011, about Paco Larra&ntilde;aga&rsquo;s plight as an accused in the controversial case of the double murder of the Chiong sisters.

Rowena Gonzalez&rsquo;s <b><i>Tatay Na, Nanay Pa</i></b> (The Father, Also a Mother), 1983, is a humorous portrait of a father who takes care of the children when the mother accepts employment in Saudi Arabia; Documentary filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4317\">Ditsi Carolino</a> made <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1235\"><strong>Minsan Lang Sila Bata</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Children Only Once</i></b>), 1996, exposing the country&rsquo;s offensive child labor practices.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><b><strong><strong>Drama</strong> </strong> </b> in Filipino cinema is a film that focuses on personal problems and conflicts. It appeals to sentiment and is usually meant to make the audience cry. The tearjerker or <b>melodrama</b> often ends on a happy or correct note, with the bad either dying or repenting, and the good turning rich or reconciling happily with their loved ones. In contrast to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1059\"><b>action film</b></a>, which attracts male audiences, Filipino drama appeals principally to female audiences. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The film drama is descended from the Spanish theater form called <b>drama</b>, introduced in the Philippines in the 19th century; its native counterpart became popular in the first half of the 20th century or the American era. The <b>silent cinema</b> used some features of the native stage drama, notably its convoluted plots and characters that tended to be caricatures, as well as its stylized acting and declarative dialogue. The coming of sound on film lessened the theatricality but heightened the emotionalism of the filmed drama. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Conflicts, often drawn from romantic literature of the prewar era, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5691\">Teofilo Sauco</a>&rsquo;s novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1769\"><strong>Ang Magmamani</strong></a></i></b> (The Peanut Vendor), published in 1923 and filmed in 1938, almost always revolved around the family and therefore were very personal. Hollywood melodramas of the 1950s, which seemed to criticize the social mores of the bourgeois family even as they reverted to conservative values, including gender-stereotyped roles, also influenced the local drama. Many dramas derive their stories from radio soap operas and <i>komiks</i> materials, which inherited and popularized the tradition of melodrama in literature and theater.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Drama in Filipino cinema may be categorized into films focusing on a <b>love triangle</b>, <b>child oppression</b>, <b>class contradictions</b>, <b>rural and urban conflicts</b>, and <b>family problems</b> or a combination of these. In all these types, the hero or heroine is pitted against the villain, innocence against corruption/exploitation, the rich against the poor, the city-bred against the <i>probinsiyano</i> (country boy). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Most numerous are the love-triangle stories, one of the earliest of which was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1311\"><strong>Tunay na Ina</strong></a></i></b> (Real Mother), 1939, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4560\">Rosario Moreno</a>.

Later examples include the following: <b><i>Minsan, Minahal Kita </i></b>(Once, I Loved You), 2000; <b><i>Kailangan Kita</i></b> (I Need You), 2002; <b><i>I Love You, Goodbye</i></b>, 2009; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1248\"><strong>No Other Woman</strong></a></i></b>, 2011; <b><i>Trophy Wife</i></b>, 2014; and <b><i>You&rsquo;re Still the <strong>One</strong> </i></b>, 2015. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Persecuted children are seen in <b><i>Hampaslupa</i></b> (Vagabond), 1937; <b><i>Alipin ng Palad</i></b> (Slave of Fate), 1938; <b><i>Roberta</i></b>, 1951; and <b><i>Mga Batang Yagit</i></b> (Pauper Children), 1984. These films focus on cute and cuddly children, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4418\">Tita Duran</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4570\">Angelito Nepomuceno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4247\">Tessie Agana</a> and Boy Alano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4484\">Ike Jarlego Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4564\">Ni&ntilde;o Muhlach</a>, and others who are maltreated by a stepmother, the father&rsquo;s <i>querida</i> (mistress), maternal or paternal aunts or uncles, and other oppressors. In the end, justice is served and the children find a loving protector and a home of their own. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Class conflict is depicted in many Filipino movies, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1797\"><strong>Sakada</strong></a></i></b> (Seasonal Cane Workers), 1976; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1123\"><strong>Bilangin ang Bituin sa Langit</strong></a></i></b> (Count the Stars in the Sky), 1989; and <b><i>Kapag Langit ang Humatol</i></b> (<b><i>Heaven&rsquo;s Judgment</i></b>), 1990. In these movies, the rich are greedy and oppressive while the poor are helpless victims. In the end, the rich undergo a change of heart or are punished with sickness, poverty, or family problems. Often, they decide to marry off a son or daughter to their poor sweethearts. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Urban versus rural themes show poor boys from the provinces being laughed at, or barrio lasses being ravished or lured and victimized by gigolos, dirty old men, or white slavers. In such movies, the provincial folk&mdash;God fearing, sincere, honest, incorruptible, gullible, nonmaterialistic&mdash;are the very opposite of the sleek, jaded, city-bred characters. These types may be seen in <b><i>Dahong Lagas</i></b> (Withered Leaf), 1938; <b><i>Probinsiyana</i></b> (Country Girl), 1946; <b><i>Basahang Ginto</i></b> (Rags of Gold), 1952; and <b><i>Babangon Ako&rsquo;t Dudurugin</i></b> <b><i>Kita</i></b> (I Will Rise and Crush You), 1989. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Family dramas are also quite common and tackle a wide range of themes. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></i></b>, 1976, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1207\"><strong>Kisapmata</strong></a> </i></b>(In the Wink of an Eye), 1981, both deal with dark themes like rape, incest, and violence. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1103\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Anak</strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (The Child), 2000, follows the story of an overseas worker mother who must deal with the physical and emotional distance between her and her children. Both <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1297\"><strong>Tanging Yaman</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>A Change of Heart</i></b>), 2000, and the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1226\"><strong>Mano Po</strong></a></i></b> (I Kiss Your Hand) film series, from 2002 to 2014, are examples of stories exploring generational and fraternal conflicts. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5436\"><strong>Marra PL.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The <b>experimental film</b> tries to do what is radically novel or innovative, or things never before done on film. It attempts to create a new film language by exploring the potentials and particularities of the medium. It stretches its limits and strives to discover what only film can do. With a long and eventful history spanning almost a century, and having been associated with several terms, influential figures, and sociopolitical movements, experimental cinema has definitely gone a long way from something oriented toward technique to a distinct type of film that does not only delve into the concerns and maladies of its time but also challenges orthodox ideas, making the filmmaker&rsquo;s deeply personal preoccupations relevant to an audience, sometimes even to a broader scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Experimental film, like most art forms, is influenced by various creative channels (visual arts, music, photography, to name the most obvious), and cinema serves as a medium through which this amalgam of artistic forms finds its expression. Its characteristics are easy to point out: the overt lack of conventional narrative, the inclination toward abstraction, the emphasis on depicting and communicating the mental and emotional state, or the exploration of techniques (may it be through cinematography, editing, soundtrack, or a combination of different experiments) to convey meaning and sentiment. These are mere generalities shared by many recognized examples of experimental movies, and therefore should not limit their definition and capacities, especially since experimental filmmaking has always been about taking a different stance toward mainstream culture and having inventive, and oftentimes poetic, approaches to film structure and construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Owing to their nature, experimental films have a smaller audience compared with <b>narrative films</b> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1062\"><b>documentaries</b></a>, and over the years this seemingly marginal existence has become part of their appeal and thereby earned their steadily growing followers. It is highly likely that in Philippine cinema, only a handful of them are known to local viewers, and among them a much smaller number are documented in books and archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">The experimental film had its beginnings in the first avant-garde film movement of the 1920s, which had a close affinity with modern art, being an offshoot of the dadaist and surrealist movements. Its strongest examples are the works of Luis Bu&ntilde;uel and Salvador Dali, Rene Clair, and Man Ray. The centers of this movement were France and Germany, where the works of Walter Ruttman, Hans Richter, and Viking Eggeling flourished.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In the early years of the cinema, &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; was also used to describe the <b>montage films</b> of the Russian filmmasters S. M. Eisenstein, V. I. Pudovkin, and G. V. Alexandrov. The montage has since been absorbed as part of the canon of film editing and filmmaking. In the Philippines, one of the earliest film experimentalists was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a>. During the silent film era, he made a short film in 16mm, titled <b><i>Tres Sanganos</i></b><i> </i>(The Three Tramps), 1927. He later expanded this into his first feature film, a three-part series entitled <b><i>The Three Tramps</i></b>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a>&rsquo;s experiments with camera techniques in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1275\"><b><i>Sakay</i></b></a>,<i> </i>1939, proved him to be a master of the mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. He revolutionized the techniques of film narration as manifested in his later films <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1104\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Anak</strong> </strong> </i> <i>Dalita</i></b></a><i> </i>(<b><i>The Ruins</i></b>), 1956, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><b><i><strong>Badjao</strong> </i></b></a>,<i> </i>1957.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>&rsquo;s directorial inventiveness set him apart from the filmmakers of his time. His arrangement of characters in careful perspective at the beginning of each shot was truly &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; because it was unorthodox and innovative. He also experimented with very unusual angles. In <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong> </i></b>,<i> </i>1951, he placed the camera under the <i>bastidor </i>(embroidery frame) to show Sisa embroidering, her face framed by the bastidor. In the same film, de Leon used extreme close-ups on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4512\">Anita Linda</a>, creating distortions to show the extent of Sisa&rsquo;s derangement. Similarly, the priest who punishes Basilio and Crispin in the film is described by a French critic as &ldquo;seemingly stepping straight out of a Bu&ntilde;uel film&rdquo; (Tesson 1983, 196).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Considered &ldquo;experimental&rdquo; in their attempts to introduce new film images and languages into mainstream cinema are the following: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad.

These pioneering films were followed by later works like Joey Agbayani&rsquo;s <b><i>Eye in the Sky</i></b>, 1984; Red&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Hikab </i></b>(The Yawn), 1984; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4255\">Mike and Juan Alcazaren</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Pagpula </i></b>(Becoming Red), 1984; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4469\">Cesar Hernando</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Botika Bituka </i></b>(Drugstore, Intestine), 1987. These filmmakers have provided enough impetus to change certain aspects of local filmmaking and generate interest in a younger generation of experimental filmmakers.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Before helming feature-length films, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4380\">Khavn de la Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4537\">Raya Martin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4708\">John Torres</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4670\">Sherad Anthony Sanchez</a>, four of the independent filmmakers of the 2000s, made several short movies with uniquely experimental qualities. De la Cruz is recognized for the dark, wild, and violent nature of his work. Moody and disturbing, his films depict disorder and bleakness, as exemplified in mostly over 70 short films he shot since 2002. This openness to experiment and tell stories differently, marked by an eye for gory details and the penchant for challenging traditional structures, persisted even in his features, such as <b><i>Ang Pamilyang Kumakain ng Lupa</i></b> (<b><i>The Family That Eats Soil</i></b>), 2005; <b><i>Paalam Aking Bulalakaw</i></b> (<b><i>Goodbye, My Shooting Star</i></b>), 2006; <b><i>Iskwaterpangk</i></b> (<b><i>Squatterpunk</i></b>), 2007; <b><i>Tatlong Araw ng Kadiliman</i></b> (<b><i>3 Days of Darkness</i></b>), 2007; <b><i>Maynila sa mga Pangil ng Dilim</i></b> (<b><i>Manila in the Fangs of Darkness</i></b>), 2008; <b><i>Son of God</i></b>, 2010; <b><i>Mondomanila (or How I Fixed My Hair after a Rather Long Journey)</i></b>, 2010; and <b><i>EDSA XXX</i></b>, 2012. A champion of digital and alternative cinema, de la Cruz was the head of the .MOV International Digital Film Festival (later renamed .MOV Film, Music, and Literature Festival), which started in 2002, creating a venue for digital and experimental films from the Philippines and all over the world. In its subsequent editions, the festival also made room for music and literary events, proudly supporting independent work and radical projects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">A graduate of the University of the Philippines Film Institute, Raya Martin started early in filmmaking. His short film <b><i>Bakasyon</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>The Visit</i></b>), 2004, and documentary <b><i>Ang Isla sa Dulo ng Mundo</i></b> (<b><i>The Island at the End of the World</i></b>), 2005, displayed his slow and quiet style, the effect of which is strange and unexpected. His features tended toward the subjects of history and time, told with faint regard for conventions, as shown in <b><i>Maicling Pelicula na&ntilde;g Ysa&ntilde;g Indio Nacional</i></b> (<b><i>A Short Film about the Indio Nacional</i></b>), 2005; <b><i>Autohystoria</i></b>, 2007; <b><i>Possible Lovers</i></b>, 2008; <b><i>Now Showing</i></b>, 2008; <b><i>Next Attraction</i></b>, 2008; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1190\"><strong>Independencia</strong></a> </i></b>(Independence), 2009. Martin proved to be a filmmaker of artistically experimental bent, working on vignettes (<b><i>Autohystoria</i></b>) and striking monochrome (<b><i>Indio Nacional</i></b> and <b><i>Independencia</i></b>), evoking mobility and immobility (the 90-minute stare in <b><i>Possible Lovers</i></b>), and freely incorporating narratives and abstractions (the five-hour <b><i>Now Showing</i></b>). In <b><i>Buenas Noches, Espa&ntilde;a </i></b>(Good Evening, Spain), 2011, he reenvisioned time travel through delirious use of colors and sound and along the way touched on colonial and postcolonial themes, turning technique into substance and substance into technique. Even his succeeding films&mdash;<b><i>The Great Cinema Party</i></b>,<i> </i>2012; <b><i>How to Disappear Completely</i></b>, 2013; and <b><i>La &Uacute;ltima Pel&iacute;cula</i></b> (<b><i>The Last Film</i></b>), 2013&mdash;demonstrated his crafty individualism. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Poetry, on the other hand, is the main weapon of John Torres. His first venture into film was <b><i>Otros Trilogy</i></b>&mdash;comprised of <b><i>Tawidgutom </i></b>(Ease the Hunger),<b> </b>2005;<b><i> Salat </i></b>(Wanting), 2005; and <b><i>Kung Paano Kita Liligawan nang &rsquo;Di Kumakapit sa Iyo? </i></b>(How Can I Court You without Holding on to You?), 2006&mdash;which made use of characteristic elements that would eventually find their way into his features: onscreen text, an expressive voiceover, and found footage. Critic Alexis Tioseco called his work &ldquo;love poems: short but sweet, aching yet tender, and always sincere, always moving: cinematic haikus&rdquo; (2006). There is a strong sense of individuality in Torres&rsquo;s work, in which the personal is political, social, sentimental, and spiritual, a pervasive consciousness hinged on confession, from where the poetry leaps to hold the film together. The main character in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1307\"><strong>Todo Todo Teros</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>2006, wakes up one night and realizes he is a terrorist, but it isn&rsquo;t the kind of terrorism that kills people instantly&mdash;the &ldquo;teros&rdquo; in the title is a portmanteau of &ldquo;terror&rdquo; and eros&rdquo;&mdash;with love being a weapon of terror. In his next features&mdash;<b><i>Voices, Tilted Screens and Extended Scenes of Loneliness: Filipinos in High Definition</i></b>, 2007; <b><i>Ang Ninanais</i></b> (<b><i>Refrains Happen Like Revolutions in a Song</i></b>), 2010; and <b><i>Lukas Ni&ntilde;o</i></b> (<b><i>Lukas the Strange</i></b>), 2013&mdash;Torres continued in the same vein of poetic construction, deconstruction, and reconstruction.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Hailing from Davao, Sherad Anthony Sanchez made his short films <b><i>Iyak ni Maria</i></b> (Cry of Maria), 2005, and <b><i>Apple</i></b>, 2005, and his acclaimed first feature <b><i>Huling Balyan ng Buhi o Ang Sinalirap nga Asoy Nila</i></b> (<b><i>Last Priestess of Buhi or</i><em>The</em><i>Woven <strong>Stories</strong> of the Other</i></b>), 2006, while he was still a student. His succeeding features&mdash;<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1188\"><strong>Imburnal</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Sewer), 2008; <b><i>Balangay</i> </b>(Balangay Boat), 2010, co-directed with Robin F&auml;rdig; and <b><i>Jungle Love</i></b>, 2012&mdash;also made the rounds of foreign festivals and earned him a large following in the art-house circuit. Sanchez is fascinated with sensations and discourses, and in his films, loosely structured and leisurely paced, are stories that do not seem to come together on the surface but are linked by a deep political and cultural affinity. He looks into the philosophy of many human constructs, challenging the viewer to study the images and how relationships and associations are made out of them. His films are often difficult to follow, but they always leave the viewer with something deep and complex.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">De la Cruz, Martin, Torres, and Sanchez may have been the well-known bearers of experimental cinema in the 2000s and after, but also equally worthy of note are artists and filmmakers who took part in the movement, whether collectively or individually, by producing short films and features that challenge the audience. Among these films are Jet Leyco&rsquo;s <b><i>Ex Press</i></b>, 2011, <b><i>Patlang</i></b> (<b><i>Blank</i></b>), 2011, and <b><i>Bukas Na Lang Sapagkat Gabi Na</i></b> (<b><i>Leave It for Tomorrow for Night Has Fallen</i></b>), 2013; Shireen Seno&rsquo;s <b><i>Big Boy</i></b>, 2011, and <b><i>Lovebird-Watching</i></b>, 2014; Gym Lumbera&rsquo;s <b><i>Dahil sa &rsquo;Yo </i></b>(Because of You), 2011, <b><i>Anak Araw</i></b> (Albino), 2012, and <b><i>Taglish</i></b>, 2012; Pam Miras&rsquo;s <b><i>Blood Bank</i></b>, 2005, and <b><i>Pascalina</i></b>, 2012; Timmy Harn&rsquo;s <b><i>Panty</i></b>, 2011, and <b><i>Ang Pagbabalat ng Ahas</i></b> (<b><i>Reptilia in Suburbia</i></b>), 2013; Christopher Gozum&rsquo;s <b><i>The Calling</i></b>, 2007, <b><i>Anacbanua</i></b> (<b><i>The Child of the Sun</i></b>), 2009, and <b><i>Lawas kan Pinabli </i></b>(<b><i>Forever Loved</i></b>), 2011; and Jon Lazam&rsquo;s <b><i>Hindi sa Atin ang Buwan</i></b> (<b><i>The Moon Is Not Ours</i></b>), 2011, <b><i>Nang Gabing Maging Singlaki ng Puso ang Bato ni <strong><strong>Darna</strong> </strong> </i></b> (<b><i>Darna: A Stone Is a Heart You Can&rsquo;t Swallow</i></b>), 2012, and <b><i><strong>Pantomina</strong> sa mga Anyong Ikinukubli ng Alon</i></b> (<b><i>Pantomime for Figures Shrouded by Waves</i></b>), 2013.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span></span><em><strong>Written by Nick Cruz, SJ and Lena S.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Fantasy films</b> subvert reality, usually by presenting an imaginary world governed by magic or other supernatural forces. Stories can involve people from &ldquo;the real world&rdquo; getting transported into the fantasy world, or they can be set entirely in that fantasy world. Alternatively, they can show these magical elements as existing side by side with the reality we know. Usually, these stories are created to evoke wonder, but they can tackle a wide variety of themes such as wish fulfillment, morality, redemption, and self-discovery/acceptance, often associated with the quest motif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Alongside fantasy, <b>science fiction</b> provides another alternative to realism, this time by bending or stretching the laws of science and technology, often beyond what reality currently allows. Science fiction films can speculate on the future, have humans encounter other life forms or invent scientific advancements that alter our own way of life. Like fantasy, they have been influenced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><i>komiks</i></a>, Western films, literature, and folklore; they likewise can be used as a platform for light or humorous stories, as well as explore more mature themes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In order to gain new ideas for moving their narratives forward or achieving a particular style, genre films can borrow elements freely from one another, especially since they are shaped by various source materials, such as folklore, komiks, foreign films, and literature. Because of these shared influences, these speculative stories also overlap with other film genres, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1059\"><b>action</b></a>, <b>adventure</b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\"><b>horror</b></a>, making certain films hard to classify, such as those that belong to the <b>superhero subgenre</b>, as exclusively fantasy or sci-fi. All of them offer an alternative to realism as representation of the human experience.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Fantasy</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Fantasy films are derived from fairy tales, like the story of <b><i>Maria Alimango</i></b> (Maria the Crab), 1938. In this Cinderella story, the kindhearted fairy godmother makes her appearance in the shape of a huge crab who talks to the girl Maria while she is washing clothes by the riverside. Maria is oppressed by a cruel stepmother and finds solace talking to the crab. The influence of Hollywood adaptations of fairy tales like <b><i>A Thousand and <strong>One</strong> Nights</i></b>, 1945, is seen in local films like <b><i>Aladin,</i></b> 1946. Others derive their material from <i>awit</i> and <i>korido </i>or metrical romances, like the tale of the quest for the bird of many colors, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\"><b><i>Ibong&nbsp; <strong>Adarna</strong> </i></b></a> (Adarna Bird), 1941, and the tale of a superhero, <b><i><strong>Bernardo Carpio</strong> </i>,</b> 1951. Fantasy films based on folklore include movies that dramatize the past, such as <strong> </strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kamakalawa</i></b> (Day before Yesterday), 1981, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\">Peque Gallaga</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Once upon a Time</i></b>, 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Komiks have become a rich source of material for Filipino fantasy films. Taking inspiration from many sources, komiks have featured characters inspired by Hollywood superheroes, or take on fabulist stories with local versions of <b><i>Weird Tales </i></b>narratives. From their pages have emerged such fantastic characters as Narda, a kindhearted woman bestowed with a magical stone that turns her into a superhero, and her nemesis, the snake-haired woman Valentina, in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Darna</strong> </strong> </i></b></a>, 1951; the prattling rooster in <b><i>Texas</i></b>, 1952; the bodyless cherub in <b><i>Kerubin </i></b>(Cherub), 1952; the mermaid who turns human in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1156\"><strong>Dyesebel</strong></a></i></b>, 1953; the headless bandit in <b><i>Tulisang <strong>Pugo</strong> t</i></b>, 1953; the talking frog in <b><i>Paniwalaan Dili</i></b><i> </i>(Believe It or Not), 1954; and the talking horse in <b><i>Silveria</i></b>, 1958. Both <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Darna</i></b><i> </i>were so successful that they spawned a series of similarly inspired films with different leading ladies throughout the years. Among those who have portrayed Dyesebel are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4519\">Edna Luna</a> in <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b>, 1953; Eva Montes in <b><i><strong> <strong>Anak</strong> </strong> ni Dyesebel</i></b><i> </i>(Daughter of Dyesebel), 1964; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a> in <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b>, 1973; Alma Moreno in <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b>, 1978; and Alice Dixson in <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b>, 1990. Some of the actresses who have played the &ldquo;wonder woman&rdquo; Darna are RosadelRosario in <b><i>Darna</i></b>, 1951; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4588\">Gina Pare&ntilde;o</a> in <b><i>Darna and the Planetman</i></b>, 1969; VilmaSantos in <b><i>Lipad, Darna, Lipad</i></b><i> </i>(Fly, Darna, Fly), 1973; Nanette Medved in <b><i>Darna</i></b>, 1991; and Anjanette Abayari in <b><i>Darna: Ang Pagbabalik</i></b> (Darna: The Return), 1994. The character would even be featured in a crossover film with another superhero, Captain Barbell. The most recent reincarnation was done in thetelevision series produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4842\">GMA Network</a> in 2005, starring Angel Locsin, and in 2009, starring Marian Rivera.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Like <b><i>Darna</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>one of the most iconic fantasy film heroes began as a comic book character created by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4312\">Carlo J. Caparas</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr</a><strong> </strong> played the titular role in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1263\"><strong>Ang Panday</strong></a></i></b> (The Blacksmith), 1980; <b><i>Pagbabalik ng Panday</i> </b>(Return of the Blacksmith), 1981; <b><i>Ang Panday&hellip; Ikatlong Yugto</i></b> (The Blacksmith&hellip; The Third Chapter), 1982; and <b><i>Ang Panday IV: Ika-Apat na Aklat</i></b> (The Blacksmith: Fourth Book), 1984. Later incarnations of the character were played by Jinggoy Estrada in <b><i>Hiwaga ng Panday</i></b> (Mystery of Panday), 1998, and by Ramon &ldquo;Bong&rdquo; Revilla Jr in <b><i>Dugo ng Panday</i></b> (Blood of the Blacksmith), 1990, <b><i>Ang Panday</i></b>, 2009, and <b><i>Panday 2</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2011. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><b><i>Super Inday and the Golden Bibe </i></b>(Super Inday and the Golden Duck), 1988, and its remake in 2010, although not based on any komiks<i> </i>characters, does continue the popular Filipino superhero trope of a good-hearted character from a humble background being chosen to become a champion of her people. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Hollywood adventure films have spawned a number of Filipino counterparts. The first Tarzan films from Hollywood gave rise to <b><i><strong>Hagibis</strong> </i></b>, 1947; <b><i>Si Og sa Maynila</i></b> (Og Goes to Manila), 1952; and <b><i>Si Og sa Army</i></b> (Og in the Army), 1954. Filipino counterparts of American superheroes are featured in such films as <b><i>Kapitan Kidlat </i></b>(Captain Lightning), 1953, and <b><i>Zoom, Zoom, Superman</i></b>, 1973. <b><i>Captain Barbell</i></b>, 1964, also became very popular. Like Darna, the character was adapted from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\">Mars Ravelo</a>&rsquo;s komiks, which were in turn still inspired by American comic book heroes. The movie&rsquo;s success brought on other incarnations of the character: <b><i>Kapitan Barbel Kontra Kapitan Bakal</i></b> (Captain Barbel versus Captain Bakal), 1965; <b><i>Captain Barbell</i></b>, 1986, in which Darna also appeared; <b><i>Captain Barbell</i></b>, 2003; and two GMA Network television series in 2006 and 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Some of mainstream Philippine cinema&rsquo;s most successful and enduring franchises are fantasy films. Combining various local, Western, and even other Asian fantasy tropes, the film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1220\"><strong>Magic Temple</strong></a></i></b>, 1996, and its sequel, <b><i>Magic Kingdom</i></b>, 1997, attained commercial and critical success with its coming-of-age adventure story about three young boys with special powers sent to a fantasy kingdom to help free it from an evil conqueror. The premise of chosen individuals becoming heroes of a magical realm is an idea other fantasy films would repeatedly go back to. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Similar to the American comedy-fantasy television series <b><i>Bewitched</i></b>, the TV sitcom <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!</i></b> (You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy!), which aired from 1987 to 1997, started a franchise of spin-off movies featuring the mechanic Enteng, played by Vic Sotto, his fairy wife Faye, and their family, putting them through various quests to vanquish evil forces. The series produced nine films in total, from 1991 to 2012. While largely using magical elements derived from Western fantasy, such as fairies and medieval costumes, it also injects concepts from science fiction into its stories in its attempts to keep the series interesting, such as aliens and cloning. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><b><i>Si Agimat at si Enteng Kabisote</i></b> (Agimat and Enteng Kabisote), 2010, and <b><i>Si Agimat, si Enteng Kabisote, at si Ako</i></b> (Agimat, Enteng Kabisote, and I), 2012, featured a crossover with another fantasy series that began with <b><i>Pepeng Agimat &hellip; Sa Daigdig ng Kababalaghan</i> </b>(Amulet Pepe &hellip; In the World of Wonder), 1973. Inspired by Philippine folklore, the film produced a sequel in 1999, and a television series. Much like many films in mainstream Philippine cinema, the role of the protagonist was passed down from father to son, from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4626\">Ramon Revilla Sr</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong> to Ramon &ldquo;Bong&rdquo; Revilla Jr, to Jolo Revilla for the television spin-off. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><b><i>Exodus: Tales from the Enchanted Kingdom</i></b>, 2005, and <b><i>Mulawin: The Movie</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2005, are examples of efforts to improve upon fantasy world-building in cinema, with the latter coming off the success of the television series from which it was derived. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The animated film <b><i>Dayo: Sa Mundo ng Elementalia</i></b> (<b><i>The Wanderer in the Land of Elementalia</i></b>), 2008, which was also heavily influenced by Philippine folklore, received positive reviews. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Science Fiction</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino films that have contributed significantly to the science fiction genre include <b><i>X-3-X</i></b>, 1934; <b><i>Exzur</i></b>, 1956; <b><i>Taong Putik</i></b> (Mud Man), 1956; <b><i>Tokyo 1960</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1957; <b><i>Zarex</i></b>, 1958; and <b><i>Anak ng Bulkan </i></b>(Child of the Volcano), 1959. Such films, which usually focus on encounters with powerful creatures from outer space or hidden from modern civilization, were likewise influenced by foreign productions, such as <b><i>Godzilla</i></b>, 1954,<b><i> </i></b>and<i> <b>Creature</b></i><b> <i>from the Black Lagoon</i></b>, 1954. Given how they are also <b>monster films</b>, they can also be classified under horror, such as <b><i>Tuko sa Madre Kakaw</i></b><i> </i>(Gecko at Madre Cacao), 1959, and Eddie Romero&rsquo;s <b><i>Brides of Blood</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1968, <b><i>Mad Doctor of Blood Island</i></b>, 1968, and <b><i>Beast of Blood</i></b>, 1971, which were inspired by H. G. Well&rsquo;s novel <b><i>The Island of Dr. Moreau</i></b>, 1896.<b><i> </i></b>Other examples that involve aliens and monsters include <b><i>Zuma</i></b>, 1985; <b><i>Magic to Love</i></b>, 1989; <b><i>Batang X </i></b>(Child X), 1995;<b><i> Balawis</i></b> (Brute), 1996; and <b><i>Kokey</i></b>, 1997. The independent film <b><i>Xenoa</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2007, and its sequel <b><i>Xenoa 2: Clash of the Bloods</i></b>, 2008, are more recent additions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><b><i>Takot Ako, Eh!</i></b> (I&rsquo;m Scared!), 1988, is an example of a film that deviates from these common tropes and uses time travel, another well-known element to science fiction, in its story. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">During the 1980s, with the popularity of George Miller&rsquo;s <b><i>Mad Max</i></b> trilogy came versions of post-apocalyptic wastelands made by local filmakers, notably Cirio Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>Wheels of Fire</i></b>, 1985, <b><i>Equalizer 2000</i></b>, 1987, and <b><i>Dune Warriors</i></b>, 1990. Santiago&rsquo;s action and exploitation films, along with Eddie Romero&rsquo;s <b><i>Blood Trilogy</i></b>, are also considered cult classics in the United States, serving as inspiration for filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino. <b><i>Resiklo</i></b><i> </i>(Recycle), 2007, is a more recent spin on post-apocalyptic sci-fi. Directed by Mark A. Reyes, the film shows a Philippines run over by insectoid aliens, where a group of survivors use whatever they could find to help defend the last stronghold of humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">As with fantasy films, komiks and the superhero genre comprise much of successful mainstream science fiction films. <b><i>Lastikman</i></b><i> </i>(Plastic Man), 1965, for example, was another Ravelo komiks superhero that saw some success and spawned other Lastikman<b> </b>films in 2003 and 2004. Other examples include <b><i>Gagamboy</i></b><i> </i>(Spider Boy), 2004; <b><i>Volta</i></b>, 2004; <b><i>Super <strong>Noy</strong> pi</i></b>, 2006; and <b><i>Wapakman</i></b>, 2009. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\">Given these blurring of genres and borrowing of local and foreign influences, some films have taken a self-aware route in their world-building. Many of these parodies are references to local and foreign superheroes and action figures. One of the most notable of the recent pastiches is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1319\"><strong>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Moveeh</strong></a></i></b>, (Zsazsa Zaturnah the Movie) 2006, an adaptation of the comic book <b><i>Ang Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Zsazsa Zaturnnah</i></b> (The Amazing Adventures of Zsazsa Zaturnnah), 2002, created by Carlo Vergara, who was also one of the writers for the film. Both book and film are homages to iconic Filipino komiks heroine Darna, and they heavily incorporate Filipino pop culture, gay humor, and other references to the superhero genre into the narrative. It tells the story of jaded, gay hairdresser Ada who is bequeathed with a magical stone from outer space that transforms him into the voluptuous superheroine Zaturnnah. Through its protagonist, the film also tackles themes related to queer identity in the Philippines. Zaturnnah arguably is a reaction to the formula of using transgender characters or &ldquo;gender-bent&rdquo; versions of superheroes as laughingstock in films, such as in <b><i>Darna, Kuno?</i></b> (They Say It&rsquo;s Darna), 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Falling under the subgenre of <b>dystopia</b> or <b>alternative history</b>, examples of less derivative speculative futures can be seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4407\">Lav Diaz</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Hesus,</i></b><i> <b>Rebolusyonaryo </b></i>(Hesus the Revolutionary), 2002, and in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4380\">Khavn de la Cruz</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>EDSA XXX: Ganito Kami Noon, Ganito Pa Rin Kami Ngayon</i></b> (<b><i>EDSA XXX: Nothing Ever Changes in the Ever-Changing Republic of Ek-Ek-Ek</i></b>), 2012. Both are more direct commentaries on Philippine history and political issues, with the former picturing an eerie, fascist dystopian Philippines that echoes events such as martial law, and the latter showing the audience a farcical take on the EDSA revolts. Whammy Alcazaren&rsquo;s <b><i>Islands</i></b>,<b> </b>2013, and Malay Javier&rsquo;s <b><i>Hindi Sila Tatanda</i></b> (They Will Not Grow Old), 2014, are other examples of films that seek to redefine these genres with their mature themes and unconventional handling of the narrative that strays from tropes seen in the aforementioned fantasy and science fiction films.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The animated film <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1274\"><strong>RPG Metanoia</strong></a></i></b>,<b> </b>2010, set in the world of massive multiplayer online role-playing games or MMORPGs, achieved critical acclaim for its refreshing premise and contributions to Philippine animation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span></span><strong><em>Written by Lena S.

		"text": "<p>The <b>historical film </b>is based on real lives or actual events that happened in the distant past. Some historical films focus on true-life stories and biographies of famous persons, such as heroes and heroines, as well as notorious personalities, such as bandits, criminals, and underworld characters, who existed at one time or another in the past. Other films deal with historical places and events, which are recreated on film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1955, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a> directed <b><i>Lapu-Lapu</i></b>. It was the first cinematic attempt to retell the life of the first documented <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> hero, which was portrayed by Mario Montenegro. Almost 50 years later, it was followed by <b><i>Lapu-Lapu</i></b>, 2002, which starred Lito Lapid and was directed by William Mayo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Diego Silang</i></b>, 1951, retells the story of the hero who led an uprising in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, in 1762. When he was felled by an assassin&rsquo;s bullet, his wife, Gabriela, assumed command of the rebels. She was eventually captured and hanged by the Spaniards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Dagohoy</i></b>, 1953, is about Francisco Dagohoy, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2336\">Boholano</a> whose anger at the Church&rsquo;s refusal to give his brother a Christian burial when the latter died in a duel, sparked the longest revolt in Philippine history, which lasted from 1744 to 1829.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The life of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> has been brought to the screen several times. Dr Edward M. Gross produced a film based on his play, <b><i>La Vida de Jose Rizal </i></b>(The Life of Jose Rizal), 1912. His business rival Albert Yearsley based his own historical film, <b><i>El Fusilamiento de Dr. Jose Rizal </i></b>(The Shooting of Dr Jose Rizal), 1912, on an account of the last hours of the national hero written by biographer Austin Craig. Both films were shown at the same time. Less than half a century later, another historical film about Rizal was produced, based on several biographies by different authors. Titled <b><i>Buhay at Pag-ibig ni Dr. Jose Rizal </i></b>(Life and Loves of Dr Jose Rizal), 1956, it starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4397\">Eddie del Mar</a>. In 1998, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4550\">Cesar Montano</a> portrayed the national hero in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><b><i>Jose Rizal</i></b></a>, a biographical film directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\">Marilou Diaz- Abaya</a>. The film retells the life of Dr Jose Rizal through a series of flashbacks as he recalls them from his cell in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>. The film also underscores how Rizal inspired the Katipunan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Supremo </i></b>(Supreme Chief), a biographical film on the life of Katipunan leader <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>, was shown in 2012. Directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4690\">Richard Somes</a>, the film starred Alfred Vargas as Bonifacio. Another film on Bonifacio,<b><i>Bonifacio: Ang Unang Pangulo </i></b>(Bonifacio: The First President), was released in 2014. It was directed by Enzo Williams and starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4583\">Robin Padilla</a> as the protagonist. <b><i>Bonifacio </i></b>offers a corrective attempt at retelling the life of the celebrated hero: Andres Bonifacio, states the film, was the Philippines&rsquo; first president. He had the vision for a free Filipino nation, and this was tragically ended when the Aguinaldo-led group of the Katipunan executed him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Tandang Sora </i></b>(Old Woman Sora), 1947, narrates the life of Melchora Aquino who, during the revolution against Spain, cared for Katipuneros wounded in battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1269\">El Presidente</a> </i></b>(The President), a 2012 film directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4542\">Mark Meily</a>, retells the life of Emilio Aguinaldo, the first president of the Philippine Republic, from his ascension to power as president of the Katipunan&rsquo;s provisional government to his forced acceptance of American rule over the country. Aguinaldo was portrayed by Jeorge &ldquo;E.R.&rdquo; Ejercito.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4312\">Carlo J. Caparas</a> directed <b><i>Tirad Pass: The Story of Gen. Gregorio del Pilar</i></b>, which starred Romnick Sarmenta as the youngest general of the Philippine revolution. The film focuses on del Pilar&rsquo;s last battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>The Tragic Death of General Luna</i></b>, 1930, is a historical film based on an actual event that remains a controversial issue. Antonio Luna was a brave and able general of the Philippine revolution whose quick temper and sharp tongue earned him many powerful enemies. When Philippine-American hostilities broke out, he was gunned down and stabbed to death by revolutionary soldiers. Luna was buried with full military honors on Emilio Aguinaldo&rsquo;s orders, but his alleged assailants from Cavite were neither questioned nor punished. <b><i>Heneral Luna </i></b>(General Luna), 2015, a film directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a>, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4271\">John Arcilla</a> as General Antonio Luna, presents the life of a leader who is perceived to be the most courageous Filipino general in Philippine history. The film focuses on Luna&rsquo;s aggressive disapproval of the American occupation of the Philippines and how this would eventually lead to several political conflicts that would ultimately culminate in Luna&rsquo;s assassination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other historical films focus on events or periods. <b><i>Hari sa Hari, Lahi sa Lahi </i></b>(<b><i>King and the Emperor</i></b>), 1986, is about the friendship and amity between the rulers of two Asian kingdoms, the Philippines and China, in the 13th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Colorum uprising in Pangasinan was the inspiration of <b><i>Tayug: Ang Bayang Api </i></b>(Tayug: The Oppressed Town), 1947. A prosperous town in central Luzon, Tayug was the scene of a peasant revolt in 1931 led by the popular Colorum leader Pedro Calosa. The rebels&rsquo; goals reflected their deep aspirations for justice, for land, and for that independence which they believed would be the solution to their age-old problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Dugo ng Bayan </i></b>(<b><i>I Remember Bataan</i></b>), 1946, is about Filipino and American soldiers fighting side by side in Bataan in World War II; while <b><i>Manila: Open City</i></b>, 1968, is about the Japanese occupation of Manila. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1262\">Panaghoy sa Suba</a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Call of the River</i></b>), 2004, narrates the occupation, rule, and rout of the Japanese in the island of Bohol during World War II.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5436\"><strong>Marra PL.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The <b>horror film</b> seeks to induce fear and terror in the audience. It features preternatural beings like vampires, ghosts, goblins, and imaginary monsters. The appeal of such material stems from the Filipino penchant for ghost stories, tales of the supernatural, and the unknown. These movies employ various techniques and motifs, from jump scares and the spectacle of the grotesque commonly associated with typical monster fare, to the manipulation of mood and audience expectations that psychological horror films are known for. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Horror films may be classified into several types: <b>straight horror</b><i> </i>as in <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b><i> </i>(Night of Terror), 1960, <b><i>Kababalaghan </i></b>(Uncanny), 1969, and <b><i><strong>Halimaw</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Monster), 1986; <b>comedy horror</b><i> </i>as in <b><i>Omeng Satanasia</i></b>,<b> </b>1977, <b><i>Takbo, Bilis, Takbo! </i></b>(Run, Quickly, Run!), 1987, and <b><i>Katabi Ko&rsquo;y</i> <i><strong>Mama</strong> w</i></b><i> </i>(The Ghost Beside Me), 1990; <b>drama horror</b><i> </i>as in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>The Rites of May</i></b>), 1976, <b><i>Haplos</i></b><i> </i>(Caress), 1982, and <b><i>Vampira </i></b>(Vampire),<b><i> </i></b>1994; and <b>sex horror</b> or <b>sexploitation films</b><i> </i>as in <b><i>Ibulong Mo sa Hangin</i></b><i> </i>(Whisper in the Wind), 1966, <b><i>Ang Batuta ni Dracula </i></b>(Dracula&rsquo;s Nightstick), 1971, and <b><i>Silip </i></b>(<b><i>Daughters of Eve</i></b>), 1985.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Horror stories may be derived from local folklore, foreign movies, or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><i>komiks</i></a> serials. Filipino folktales dealing with the supernatural provided the subject for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Manananggal </i></b>(The Viscera Sucker), 1927, and the first talking picture produced in the Philippines, <b><i>Ang Aswang</i></b><i> </i>(The Aswang), 1933. The influence of foreign films like <b><i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i></b>, 1923, may be seen in <b><i>Dr. Kuba</i></b><i> </i>(Dr Hunchback), 1933, and in movies with double-identity horror heroes or Jekyll-and-Hyde characters. Monster movies from Japan and the United States similarly inspired local filmmakers. Notable among them is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a>, with such movies as <b><i>Beast of the Yellow Night</i></b>, 1971, <b><i>The Twilight People</i></b>, 1972, and his Blood Island<i> </i>trilogy:<b><i> Brides of Blood</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1968, <b><i>Mad Doctor of Blood Island</i></b>, 1968, and <b><i>Beast of Blood</i></b>, 1971. Other examples are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Terror Is a Man</i></b>, 1971, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4671\">Cirio H. Santiago</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Demon of Paradise</i></b>, 1987. Monstrous statues that come to life&mdash;as in <b><i>Mambo Dyambo</i></b>, 1955, where the inimitable <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a> portrayed the komiks character invented by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\">Mars Ravelo</a>&mdash;have brought much horror-viewing pleasure to movie audiences. Movies like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1161\"><strong>Feng Shui</strong></a></i></b>, 2004, and <b><i>TxT</i></b>, 2006, take their cue from other Asian horror films, with the latter inspired by stories that incorporate technology into the premise, such as the Japanese film <b><i>Ring</i></b>, 1998. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Some horror films make considerable use of special effects. In this regard, the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\">Peque Gallaga</a> and Lorenzo A. Reyes in the &ldquo;Manananggal&rdquo; (Viscera Sucker) episode of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1289\"><b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll</i></b></a>, 1984, was so successful that the movie was followed by other Gallaga films: the two-part <b><i>Hiwaga sa Balete Drive</i></b> (<b><i>Mystery on Balete Drive</i></b>), 1988; the full-length <b><i>Tiyanak</i></b> (<b><i>Changeling</i></b>), 1988; <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll II</i></b>, 1990; <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll III</i></b>, 1991; and <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll IV</i></b>, 1992.

Though some actors, such as Manilyn Reynes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4415\">Eugene Domingo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4368\">Janice de Belen</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4468\">Tonton Gutierrez</a>, and Carla Abellana, would appear in multiple installments, the series makes use of an anthology format, with each film telling three unrelated stories of protagonists plagued by various supernatural threats. Antagonists range from popular local and Western monsters like ghosts, vampires, and shapeshifters, to creatures unique to the particular segment in which they appear. <b><i>Magandang <strong>Hatinggabi</strong> </i></b> (Good Midnight), 1998, and <b><i>Cinco</i></b> (Five), 2010, also make use of the anthology format. <b><i>Pridyider</i></b><i> </i>(Fridge), 2012, is a full-length feature based on one of the segments from the first <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll</i></b> movie. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The segments of <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll</i> <i>XV</i></b>, 2014, were directed by Dondon Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a>, and Perci Intalan. Some of the other directors who helmed segments from the series are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>, Topel Lee, Mike Tuviera, Zoren Legaspi, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4650\">Chito Ro&ntilde;o</a>.

Castillo</a>. Its story of an evil sister&rsquo;s ghost terrorizing a woman and her lover spawned a 1995 remake helmed by Chito Ro&ntilde;o and a GMA Network miniseries in 2008. Ro&ntilde;o himself would go on to direct other horror films, such as <b><i>Spirit Warriors</i></b>, 2000, <b><i>Spirit Warriors: The Shortcut</i></b>, 2003, <b><i>Feng Shui</i></b>, <b><i>Sukob</i></b><i> </i>(The Wedding Curse), 2006, and <b><i>Feng Shui 2</i></b>, 2014. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><b><i>Sigaw</i></b> (<b><i>The Echo</i></b>), 2004, and <b><i>The Road</i></b>, 2011, both directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4503\">Yam Laranas</a>, received some success locally and were released internationally, proving the seeming universal popularity of ghost stories in film. Philippine folkloric monsters are still a staple of the genre, as in the action-adventure films <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1304\"><strong>Tiktik: The Aswang Chronicles</strong></a></i></b>, 2012, and <b><i>Kubot: The Aswang Chronicles 2</i></b>, 2014. The independent film <b><i>Zombadings: Patayin sa Shokot si Remington</i> </b>(<b><i>Remington and the Curse of the Zombadings</i></b>), 2011, takes the zombie subgenre and provides it with a queer comedic twist, its title already a parody of another classic horror flick.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><em><strong><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span>Written by&nbsp;</strong> </em></span><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4364\"><strong>Joel David</strong></a> and Lena S.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">A <b>komedi</b> is a film that aims to make people laugh. In the komedi film, characters are placed in a series of ludicrous situations to incite laughter from the viewers. There are three types of komedi: the <b>romantic</b>, the <b>slapstick</b>, and the <b>social satire</b>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The romantic comedy is a love story with its complement of humor, music, and songs. Its plot usually consists of a series of amorous situations focusing on mistaken identity, chance encounters, and use of disguises. The romantic comedy tradition in Filipino cinema is traced to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a>&rsquo;s first silent film, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1238\"><strong>Miracles of Love</strong></a></i></b>, 1925. The hero, a young doctor, falls in love with the picture of a coed on a magazine cover. He seeks her out at her family home and is mistaken for a domestic servant applying for a job. After a series of funny incidents, the doctor and coed fall in love and elope, bringing the entire household after them on a merry chase before they finally wind up before a justice of the place to get married. Another silent film in this genre is <b><i>Ang</i></b><i> <b>Tatlong Hambog</b> </i>(The Three Braggarts), 1926. Three men courting the same girl show up for a date. One arrives in his flashy car, another shows up in a <i>calesa </i>(horse-drawn carriage), and the third one makes his appearance astride a carabao. In the end, the girl chooses the farm boy, showing the period&rsquo;s preference for country life. The couple later indulge in the &ldquo;first kiss&rdquo; in Philippine movies. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Other examples of the romantic comedy are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4559\">Oscar Moreno</a> tandem in <b><i>Si, Si, Se&ntilde;orito</i></b><i> </i>(Yes, Yes, My Lord), 1947; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\">Pancho Magalona</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4418\">Tita Duran</a> comedy <b><i>Buhay Pilipino</i></b><i> </i>(Filipino Life), 1952; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\">Nida Blanca</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4396\">Nestor de Villa</a> starrers <b><i><strong>Waray-Waray</strong> </i></b>,<i> </i>1954, <b><i>Handang Matodas</i></b><i> </i>(Ready to Die), 1956, and <b><i>My Serenade</i></b>, 1961; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\">Gloria Romero</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4461\">Luis Gonzales</a> romantic comedies <b><i>Despatsadora</i></b><i> </i>(Saleslady), 1955, and <b><i>Vacacionista</i></b><i> </i>(The Tourist), 1956.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The earliest recorded Filipino slapstick comedy was <b><i>Enchong, Ang Medicong Laway</i></b><i> </i>(Enchong, The Spit Doctor), 1915. Both a comedy and a commentary on the medical profession, it reflects the superstitions of rural folk, who have more faith in quack doctors than in men of science. In the slapstick comedy film, one source of laughter is a person&rsquo;s psychological or physical defect. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\">Susan Roces</a> is an incurable chatterbox in <b><i>Susanang Daldal</i></b><i> </i>(Susan the Chatterbox), 1962. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4900\">Matutina</a> of the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>series has a shrill, high-pitched voice. More often, the defect is physical, as in the case of the toothless <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\">Chichay</a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3205\">Rene Requiestas</a>, the cross-eyed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4229\">Pablo Virtuoso</a>, the big-mouthed Carding of the Reycard Duet, the bag-eyed Doro de los Ojos, the toothpick-thin Palito, the dour-faced Billy &ldquo;Surot&rdquo; Vizcarra, the bald <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, or the &ldquo;thin-and-fat&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2423\">Bayani</a> and Soto. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In <b><i>Tansan vs Tarsan</i></b>,<i> </i>1963, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, pitted against <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4722\">Vic Vargas</a>, is pitifully asthmatic. The source of laughter in slapstick comedy can also come from uncouth manners and boorish behavior of well-meaning characters. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4628\">Efren Reyes</a>&rsquo;s unwillingness to take a bath makes him the laughingstock of society in <b><i>Pedro Penduko</i></b>,<i> </i>1954. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In another form of slapstick comedy, the characters featured are considered an &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; object of fun because they go against the predominant views of society. Dolphy in <b><i>Jack and Jill</i></b>, 1954, Roderick Paulate in <b><i>Kumander Gringa</i></b><i> </i>(Commander Gringa), 1987, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4807\">Joey de Leon</a> in <b><i>Barbie</i></b>,<i> </i>1989, portray homosexual or effeminate characters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Still another form of slapstick derives from toilet <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">humor</span>, as <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">seen in some films of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4968\">Tito</a></span><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4968\">, <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Vic</span> </a><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4968\">and Joey</a>, </span>i<span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">ncludin</span>g <b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">The Long Ranger</span></i></b><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">,<i> </i>1989</span>, <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">with Rene </span>Re<span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">quie</span>s<span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">tas</span>, <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">where the characters make fun of excretory </span>f<span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">unction</span><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">s. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Some of the early <i>bodabil</i> stage artists rose to fame as masters of slapstick in the Filipino comedy film. Even before the Pacific War, comedians Pugo and Togo already starred in their own film, <b><i>Ang Utos ng </i></b></span><b><i>Hari Hindi Mababale </i></b>(A King&rsquo;s Command Is Final), 1941.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">The postwar period saw Lopito becoming a full </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\">star in </span><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong> </span></i></b><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">,<i> </i>1950, while Tolindoy and Chichay </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\">came into their own as </span><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">Gorio at Tekla </span></i></b><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">(Gorio and Tekla), 1953. Other comedians did not have star-billing </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\">status but their unforgettable performances have lived on in their films. Gregorio Ticman was outstanding as the </span><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.15pt\">sabungero </span></i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">(cockfight aficionado) in <b><i>Texas: Ang Ma</i></b></span><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\">nok na Nagsasalita</span></i></b><i> </i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\">(Texas: The Talking Rooster), </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">1952, who gambled away his wife </span><span style=\"letter-spacing:.25pt\">and children&rsquo;s future and later became the picture of contrition, and as the tough military sergeant who made a man out of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4555\">Fred Montilla</a> in </span><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">Bondying</span></i></b><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">,<i> </i>1954. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">The influence of foreign films on local comedy pictures with slapstick cannot be discounted. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2813\">Canuplin</a> was the local version of Hollywood&rsquo;s Charlie Chaplin in the early </span>1930s, while Laurel and Hardy, and Abbott and Costello <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">have spawned a number of thin-and-fat comedy duos </span>from Bayani and Soto, Pugo and Togo, Pugak and <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Tugak, to Dolphy and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4254\">Panchito</a></span>. <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">The Lone Ranger and his sidekick Tonto, or Tarzan and his chimpanzee Cheetah, have found their counterparts in Joey de Leon and Rene Requiestas or the Reycard Duet</span>. <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">The Three Stooges inspired the comedy trio of Tito</span>, <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Vic</span> <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">and Joey who made a number of films before Tito Sotto broke away from the team to enter politics</span>. <span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Among their films are </span><b><i>Give Me Five</i></b>,<i> </i><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">1985; </span><b><i>Horsey-Horsey</i></b>,<i> </i>1985; <b><i>Send in the Clowns</i></b>,<i> </i><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">1986; and </span><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Shoot That Ball</span></i></b>,<i> </i>1987.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Aside from the earlier comedians mentioned above, other notable comedians of recent vintage who use both wit and slapstick must be mentioned. Andrew E., <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4905\">Michael V.</a>, Bayani Agbayani, and Dennis Padilla are among the more popular comedians of the 1990s. Andrew E. gained popularity with his film <b><i>Humanap Ka ng Panget </i></b>(Find Someone Ugly), 1990. Michael V.&rsquo;s films include <b><i>Manolo and Michelle Hapi Together</i></b>, 1994, and <b><i>Rubberman</i></b>, 1996. Bayani Agbayani and Dennis Padilla did supporting roles&mdash;Agbayani in films like <b><i><strong>Pagdating ng Panahon</strong> </i> </b>(When the Time Comes), 1998, and <b>&rsquo;<i>Di Puwedeng Hindi Puwede</i> </b>(No Isn&rsquo;t Acceptable), 1999, and Padilla in <b><i>Ang Utol Kong Hoodlum</i></b> (My Hoodlum Brother), 1991, and <b><i>Mandurugas</i></b> (Thief), 1992. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.4pt\">In the 2000s, comediennes made comedy hits, like Ai-Ai de las Alas in <b><i>Tanging Ina</i></b><i> </i>(The One and Only Mom), 2003, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4415\">Eugene Domingo</a> in <b><i>Kimmy Dora</i></b>, 2009.

Actors Vhong Navarro and Vice Ganda gained popularity with the films <b><i>Mr. Suave</i></b>, 2003, and <b><i>Praybeyt Benjamin</i></b>, 2011, respectively. Child actress Ryzza Mae Dizon, who rose to prominence in 2012, starred in the film <b><i>My Little Bossings</i></b>, 2013, paired with child actor Bimby Yap.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">Among the comedy films of this period are <b><i>Pera o Bayong</i></b> (Cash or Basket), 2000; <b><i>Pinay Pie</i></b>, 2003; <b><i>Bcuz of U</i></b>, <b><i>Okay Ka Fairy Ko</i></b><i>: <b>Enteng Kabisote, The Legend </b></i>(You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy: Enteng Kabisote, The Legend), <b><i>Lastikman</i></b><i> </i>(Plastic Man), and <b><i>Otso Otso Pamela-mela Wan</i></b>, 2004; <b><i>D&rsquo; Anothers </i></b>and<b> <i>So</i></b><i> <b>Happy Together</b></i>, 2005; <b><i>Binibining K</i></b> (Miss K), <b><i>Manay Po! </i></b>(I Am Gay!),<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Mourning Girls</i></b>, 2006; <b><i>Agent X-44</i></b>, <b><i>Ang Cute ng Ina Mo</i></b> (Your Mother Is So Cute), <b><i>Angels</i></b>,<b> <i>Apat Dapat, Dapat Apat</i></b> (It Must Be Four, Four Must It Be), <b><i>My Kuya&rsquo;s Wedding</i></b> (My Older Brother&rsquo;s Wedding), 2007; <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b><i> <b>20 Years After:</b> <b>Ungasis and Escaleras Adventure</b></i>, 2008; <b><i>Ang Darling Kong Aswang</i></b> (My Darling Aswang),<b><i> BFF: Best Friends Forever</i></b>,<b> <i>OMG (Oh My Girl)</i></b>, and <b><i>Status: Single</i></b>, 2009; <b><i>Father Jejemon</i></b> and <b><i><strong>Mama</strong> razzi</i></b>, 2010; <b><i>The Adventures of Purezza: Queen of the <strong>Riles</strong> </i></b>and <b><i>Pak!

These include <b><i>Si Juan Tamad </i></b>(Lazy Juan), 1947, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1197\"><strong>Juan Tamad Goes to Congress</strong></a></i></b>, 1959, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1198\"><strong>Juan Tamad Goes to Society</strong></a></i></b>, 1960, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1290\">Si Juan Tamad at si Juan Masipag sa Pulitikang Walang Hanggan</a> </i></b>(Lazy Juan and Industrious Juan in Never-Ending Politics), 1963, <b><i>Juan Tamad Junior</i></b>, 1980, and <b><i>Juan Tamad</i></b>, 1993. His son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4978\">Jun Urbano</a> later picked up from where his father left off, with his own <b><i>Mongolian Barbecue</i></b>, 1991. Another film in this genre, which was popular in the early 1950s, was <b><i><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong> </i></b> (The Rig Driver&rsquo;s Tale). In recent years, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1150\">Ded Na si Lolo</a> </i></b>(<b><i>Grandpa Is Dead</i></b>), 2009, satirized the different local beliefs and superstitions about dying, wakes, and burials.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4364\"><strong>Joel David</strong></a> and Lena S.

There are four kinds of Filipino musicals: the filmed<b> </b><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a></em>, which is directly lifted from its stage version, such as <b><i><strong>Walang Sugat</strong> </i></b> (No Wounds), 1939; the <b>sarsuwela-type musical</b> or <b>film sarsuwela</b>, which uses all the elements of the theatrical sarsuwela, although it is conceived only for the screen and has no stage version, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\"><strong>Giliw Ko</strong></a></i></b> (My Love), 1939; the <b>Hollywood-type musical</b>, which has a distinctly American flavor, such as <b><i>The Big Broadcast</i></b>, 1962; and the <b>new musical</b>, as exemplified by <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1202\"><strong>Kakabakaba Ka Ba?</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Will Your Heart Beat Faster?</i></b>), 1980, and <b><i>Pabling </i></b>(Playboy), 1981. In general, practically any type of story, from the tragic to the comic to the fantastic, can be utilized for film musicals, although an unfortunate impression of frivolity and extravagance has been attached to the genre. More often than not, musicals tend to deal with romantic or comic themes rather than serious ones.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In the filmed sarsuwela, there is a direct transfer from stage to screen. The stage production of the sarsuwela is reproduced on film in its entirety, sometimes with the same stage actors. This was the case with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>&rsquo;s first movie, <b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b> (Country Maiden), 1919, which reproduced on film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s sarsuwela popularized on stage by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a> and Marceliano Ilagan. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">With the advent of sound in the age of talking pictures, the sarsuwela slowly bowed out of stage. But since this kind of musical still appealed to the public, movie producers commissioned sarsuwela-type films that retained most, if not all, of the elements of the theatrical form. These musicals were pioneered by the team of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\">Carlos Vander Tolosa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\">Mike Velarde</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4574\">Luis Nolasco</a> who were behind such films as <b><i><strong>Nasaan Ka Irog?</strong> </i></b> (Where Are You, Beloved?), 1937, and <b><i>Madaling Araw</i></b> (Break of Dawn), 1938. The biggest musical star of the prewar period was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4577\">Elsa Oria</a>, the &ldquo;Singing Sweetheart of the Philippines,&rdquo; whose sarsuwela-type films were warmly received regardless of who played her leading men. Aside from making <b><i>Nasaan Ka Irog?</i></b> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4421\">Angel Esmeralda</a> and <b><i>Madaling Araw</i></b> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4616\">Ely Ramos</a>, she also performed with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Bituing Marikit</strong> </strong> </i></b> </a>(Beautiful Star), 1937; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\">Leopoldo Salcedo</a> in<b><i> Alitaptap</i></b> (Firefly), 1940; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4343\">Rudy Concepcion</a> in <b><i>Paroparong Bukid</i></b> (Country Butterfly), 1938, and <b><i>Ikaw Rin</i></b> (You, Too), 1940. When love teams became the vogue, this type of musical was made more popular by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4560\">Rosario Moreno</a> and Rudy Concepcion in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Pakiusap</strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (Plea), 1940; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4464\">Lucita Goyena</a> and Serafin Garcia in <b><i>Ang Viuda Alegre </i></b>(The Merry Widow), 1941; and, most of all, by the tandem of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a> and Rogelio de la Rosa in such musicals as <b><i>Se&ntilde;orita</i></b> (Young Mistress), 1940; <b><i>Lambingan</i></b> (Romance), 1940;<b><i> Panambitan</i></b> (Lament), 1941; and <b><i><strong>Tampuhan</strong> </i></b> (Lovers&rsquo; Quarrel), 1941. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">During the World War II, when film production was suspended, Filipinos went to see plays, stage shows, and <i>bodabil</i> instead of their usual film fare. After the war, the sarsuwela-type musical showed a more pragmatic sensibility, combining lyricism and realism. This was evident in such films as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\">Pancho Magalona</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4418\">Tita Duran</a> starrer <b><i>Sa Isang Sulyap Mo, Tita</i></b> (With One Glance from You, Tita), 1953; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\">Nida Blanca</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4396\">Nestor de Villa</a> pictures like <b><i><strong>Waray-Waray</strong> </i></b>, 1954, and <b><i>Ikaw Kasi</i></b> (You Are to Blame), 1955; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\">Gloria Romero</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4461\">Luis Gonzales</a> musicals like <b><i>Sa Libis ng Nayon </i></b>(At the Countryside), 1959; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4747\">Zaldy Zshornack</a>&ndash;Shirley Gorospe attractions like <b><i>Sweethearts</i></b>, 1957. Separated by many years, <b><i>I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila!</i></b><i> </i>(I Do Bidoo Bidoo: The APO Is Here!), 2012, displays the same sensibility. Featuring the musical hits of one of the country&rsquo;s most enduring singing groups, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\">Apo Hiking Society</a>, its narrative tells of a romance between a boy and a girl from opposite sides of the social spectrum. Through their journey toward marriage, their families, initially at war with each other mainly because of class-related differences, discover certain truths and epiphanies about themselves and the power of love.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The Hollywood-type musicals ushered in the era of big production numbers and star-studded casts, such as those found in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Big Broadcast</i></b>, 1962. The musicals in the 1970s were dominated by singing star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> and matinee idol <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a> who appeared in films like <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971. The influence of Hollywood could be seen in these musicals&rsquo; extravagant sets, lavish costumes, and big production numbers. They were mostly inspired by the movies of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, especially those that starred the MGM bathing beauty Esther Williams. <b><i>Annie Batungbakal</i></b>, 1979, was a takeoff on the Hollywood disco movie <b><i>Saturday Night Fever</i></b>, 1977, which was so popular that many a Filipino teenager aped the moves of John Travolta. In comparing the musicals made from the 1930s to the 1950s with the musicals of the late 1960s and early 1970s, one finds that nothing of real artistic import was produced in the latter period. This was due not so much to the juvenility of the talents as to the misappropriation of musical routines at the expense of thematic development. While the earlier studio-system musicals were based on serviceable stories, the teen-idol films used hackneyed situations&mdash;meddlesome adults and misfits getting in the way of the lead characters&rsquo; romance&mdash;to bridge musical numbers. These musical numbers in turn consisted of the latest hits, usually foreign, strung together without regard for topical relations and interpreted to resemble the original versions as closely as possible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The makers of the new musicals were driven by considerations that go beyond pure entertainment and visual delight. <b><i>Pabling</i></b> underscores the gap between the urban and rural social classes in its account of the exploits of a young man, a <i>promdi</i> (from the province) going to the big city in quest of fame and fortune. <b><i>Kakabakaba Ka Ba?</i></b>, particularly in its closing production number, satirizes the imperialistic designs of Japan and China on the country. It highlights its political message with a dazzling array of witty visual and optical effects. The new musical came back in 2006 through <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1319\">Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Moveeh</a> </i></b>(Zsazsa Zaturnnah: The Movie), a film adaptation of Carlo Vergara&rsquo;s graphic novel <b><i>Ang Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Zsazsa Zaturnnah </i></b>(The Amazing Adventures of Zsazsa Zaturnnah), 2002. The narrative, a gender-bending version of the Darna story, features Ada, the gay <i>parlorista</i> (beautician) who turns into a female superhero, Zsazsa Zaturnnah, when he swallows a magical stone. After many hurdles, she finds the love of her life in the character of Dodong. Another musical, <b><i>Emir</i></b>, 2010, follows the story of Amelia, a girl from a poor Ilocano family who serves a royal family in the Middle East and gets attached to their child Ahmed, whom she saves when the war destroys the palace. Ahmed is later taken away from Amelia under the sheik&rsquo;s order. Amelia goes home to the Philippines, but several years later Ahmed visits Amelia and the film ends with their reunion. Thus, the radical shift from the musicals of the 1970s, which merely feature the latest hits around which the films&rsquo; stories are woven, to the new musicals with more original stories represents a significant movement not only in the arena of Philippine cinema but in Philippine music as well.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4364\"><strong>Joel David</strong></a>, Lena S.

Time and place are carefully recreated in the movie. The genre also overlaps with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><b>historical films</b></a>, as fictionalized versions of historical figures do sometimes appear as characters in these narratives, and biopics present filmmakers with opportunities to recreate the look of specific decades. Under period and historical films spring other subgenres, such as <b>alternative history</b> or <b>historical fantasy</b>. This section will focus mainly on the more conventional examples of period films whose characters are entirely fabricated.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">The first period films were those based on the novels of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>, which are set in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Rizal&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (Touch Me Not) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong></a> </i></b>(Subversion) had been adapted several times. Well-known adaptations are Edward M.

Gerardo de Leon&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><b><i>Sisa</i></b></a> in 1951 extended and allegorized the character&rsquo;s story. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>&rsquo;s version in 1999 with the same title provided another possible context, situating a &ldquo;real&rdquo; Sisa in the life of Rizal. The most recent adaptation, directed by Crisostomo Juan Andaluz in 2008, has the same title. Like de Leon&rsquo;s adaptation, Andaluz&rsquo;s film extensively explores the character&rsquo;s backstory that will explain her eventual descent into madness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">In <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1314\"><strong>Virgin Forest</strong></a></i></b>, 1985, the Makabebes&rsquo; role in the capture by the Americans of the last Filipino rebel provides the backdrop against which director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\">Peque Gallaga</a> projects his views on the emerging national consciousness of that time.

A film that is less than 60 minutes long is considered short, but some film festivals set the limits at 15-30 minutes for short films. Most short films are independently produced by new filmmakers with a small budget. They are screened in film festivals, schools, nonprofit venues, and Internet websites to reach their audiences. Filmmakers are free to explore out-of-the-box themes and experiment with the medium; short films can be <b>fiction stories</b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1062\"><b>documentaries</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1060\"><b>animation</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1064\"><b>experimental</b></a>, or other forms.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Cinema was introduced in Spanish-colonized Manila in 1897 with the screening of short films, which lasted no more than 45 seconds each and became the rage of the viewing public. An officer of the Spanish Army, Antonio Ramos, imported a Lumiere Cinematographe along with 30 films that had the capacity to photograph and project films that he made in Manila in 1898.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Short films in the form of documentation (travelogues, events, and activities) during the American colonial period blossomed into longer feature films that ran for more than an hour with the opening of more moviehouses in Manila which became one of the centers for film exhibition in the Far East of the 20th century. Films came not only from the United States but also from other European countries like France, Germany, Italy, England, and Denmark. Films like Lumiere Brothers travelogues and George Melies&rsquo;s <b>film d&rsquo;art</b> were shown. Filipino film director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a> made and starred in short comedies during the silent-film era in the late 1920s. But more Hollywood entertainment full-length feature films flooded the increasing number of moviehouses in the 1930s thus relegating the short films on the side. Parlatone-Hispano Filipino, one of the major film productions in the 1930s, produced <b><i>The International Eucharistic Congress</i></b><i> </i>in 1936 and <b><i>PMA Cadets</i></b> in 1938. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a>&rsquo;s<b><i><strong>Balut</strong> </i></b> (Duck&rsquo;s Egg), 1939, has elements of the documentary, but considered the best in this period was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a>&rsquo;s 25-minute<b> <i><strong> <strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </i></b>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">After World War II, massive information program through film was launched in support of the country&rsquo;s rehabilitation and development. More documentary films were made like <b><i>I Was a Trainee</i> </b>by Armando Medel, Dominador Estanislao, and Benedicto &ldquo;Ben&rdquo; Pinga which deals with the life of young men who had been drafted into the army. In the 1950s, outstanding Filipino short films were made like <b><i>Si Mang Anong</i></b> (Old Man Anong) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a> and <b><i>The Gray Menace</i></b><i>.</i> Jose Avellana&rsquo;s <b><i>Without Fear of Tomorrow</i></b> won the best documentary award at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> in 1957.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4601\">Ben Pinga</a> ushered the production, exhibition, and international promotion of short films. Some of his short films won awards in international film festivals, even before full-length feature films won in Asian festivals. Lamberto V. Avellana&rsquo;s <b><i>El Legado</i></b> (The Legacy) in 1958 and his other film <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1138\"><b><i>La Campana de <strong>Baler</strong> </i></b></a> (The Church Bell of Baler) in 1960 both won the Conde de Foxa award at the Bilbao Film Festival. Other films cited during this period were Fidel de Castro&rsquo;s <b><i>The Land is Free</i></b> in the Week of Asian Film in Frankfurt, 1962; and Emeterio Ornedo&rsquo;s <b><i>They Shall Not Want</i></b>, 1962, and <b><i>Brave Little Island</i></b>, produced by Tony Smith in 1963, both at the San Francisco International Film Festival. Jose Navarro Jr&rsquo;s <b><i>Masinloc</i></b> was also cited in the Industrial Film Festival in London in 1963. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a>&rsquo;s<b><i><strong>Bayani</strong> han </i></b>(Mutual Cooperation) won several awards in international film festivals in Europe and the United States. 1964 was the luckiest year for Philippine short films. <b><i>Soul of a Fortress</i></b>, produced by Ben Pinga, won a string of awards like the Miguel di de Plata Award, the second major prize at Bilbao Film Festival, award of excellence by the International Federation of Film Societies, best documentary award in the Frankfurt Film Festival, award of merit at Vancouver Film Festival, certificate of merit at San Francisco Film Festival, and in 1965 at the Berlin and Melbourne Film Festivals. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Some full-length feature films made by major film productions up to the present are actually anthologies or short feature films if shown separately. Premiere Productions&rsquo; <b><i>Apat na Kasaysayang Ginto</i></b> (Four Golden Stories), 1956, was the first anthology film, followed by LVN Pictures&rsquo; <b><i>Medalyong Perlas</i></b> (Pearl Medallion), 1956, and <b><i>Casa Grande</i></b><i> </i>(Mansion), 1957, with stories connected through a pearl and a mansion respectively in both films. More anthologies were made like <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><strong>Mga Kuwento ni <strong>Lola</strong> Basyang</strong> </span></span> (Stories of Grandma Basyang), 1958; religious films like <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Pitong Pagsisisi</span></span> (Seven Regrets), 1959, and <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Limang Misteryo ng Krus</span></span><b> </b>(Five Mysteries of the Cross), 1960; horror films like <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Gabi ng Lagim</span></span> (Night of Terror), <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Ginoong Misteryoso</span></span> (Mr Mysterious), <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Pagsapit ng <strong>Hatinggabi</strong> </span></span><b> </b>(At Midnight), and <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Katotohanan o Guni-guni</span></span> (Real or Imagined), all in 1960, <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Mga Daing sa Libingan</span></span> (Cries in the Grave), <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Konsiyerto ng Kamatayan</span></span> (Concert of Death), and <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Limang Yugto ng Buhay</span></span> (Five Chapters of Life), all in 1961, and <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Fe, Esperanza, Caridad</span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">,</span></span></span></span> 1974, which starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a>, directed by Lamberto Avellana, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4671\">Cirio Santiago</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1289\"><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll</span></span></a><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">, first shown in 1984, became a successful horror-trilogy franchise</span></span></span></span> that now has 15 sequels. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a> directed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1102\"><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><strong>Aliw</strong> an Paradise</span></span></a> in 1992 as part of the Asian anthology <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Southern Winds</span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">More short films were made during the repressive Martial Law era of the 1970s that nipped every free form of expression in the country. Social decay and political havoc created by the Marcos dictatorship became the context from which makers of short films built their own alternative cinema. Although <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4490\"><strong>Kidlat Tahimik</strong></a>&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1218\">Perfumed Nightmare</a> </span></span>is a full-length film, its winning of the jury prize in Berlin in the 1970s inspired a lot of short-film makers because of Kidlat Tahimik&rsquo;s highly independent spirit. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">Through the support of foreign institutions such as the Goethe Institut, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\">Mowelfund Film Institute (MFI)</a>, established in 1979, along with the University of the Philippines (UP) Film Center, stood tall in drawing up the country&rsquo;s contemporary alternative film history. MFI and the UP Film Center conducted film workshops that produced short films (mostly on the Super 8mm film format) that became a veritable treasure trove with films like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4623\">Raymond Red</a>&rsquo;s experimental films <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1222\"><strong>Ang Magpakailanman</strong></a></span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"> (Eternity),</span></span> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1199\"><strong>Kabaka</strong></a> </span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Enemy),</span></span> Kamada </span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Mate),</span></span> Ang Hikab</span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"> (The Yawn),</span></span></span></span> and <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Pelikula</span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"> (Film)</span></span></span></span>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>&rsquo;s documentaries <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a></span></span> and <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Revolutions Happen Like Refrains in a Song</span></span>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4655\">Roxlee</a>&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Juan Gapang</span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">,</span></span> Tronong Puti</span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\"> (White Throne)</span></span></span></span> and his animation <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">The Great Smoke</span></span>; Joey Agbayani&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Eye in the Sky </span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">and</span></span> Kidlat </span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Lightning)</span></span></span></span>, and many others. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">From the 1970s up to the present, more filmmaking workshops were held and more schools offered classes on filmmaking. Leading universities are UP Film Institute and Communication Arts departments of Ateneo de Manila, De La Salle University (DLSU) in Manila and Bacolod, College of Saint Benilde, University of Santo Tomas, Kalayaan College, and Far Eastern University. Short feature, documentary, experimental, and animation film categories were made mostly in Super-8mm and 16mm film formats, until the 1990s when video and digital formats flourished. With digital technology and easily accessible editing software, virtually all mass communication students have the ability to produce low-budget short films. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0in 0in 8pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"tab-stops:.25in 24.0pt\">It was in the tumultuous era of the early 1980s leading up to the EDSA Revolt of 1986 when filmmakers became seriously aware of each other&rsquo;s existence, leading to the emergence of a significant movement in alternative cinema. Recognition for the works of short-film makers was finally in order. Outstanding among them are the experimental films <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Kalawang</span></span> (Rust) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4469\">Cesar Hernando</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5355\">Eli Guieb III</a>, and Jimbo Albano, <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Pilipinas</span></span> (Philippines) by Regiben Roman, <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Minsan Isang Panahon</span></span> (Once Upon a Time) by Melchor Bacani III, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3052\"><strong>RJ Leyran</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Bugtong </i></b>(Riddle). In the 1980s, short film competitions like the Manila Short Film Festival and Experimental Cinema of the Philippines&rsquo; short film festivals were held. British film critic Tony Rayns introduced Raymond Red&rsquo;s awardwinning short films in European film festivals. In 1990, the Quezon City Super-8 International Film Festival showcased the best local and international short films. Gawad CCP Para sa Alternatibong Pelikula at Video at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Film Festival</a> became the springboards of filmmakers for more artistic expressions. Short-film awards were also given by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a>. In 2000, Raymond Red&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1105\"><strong>Ani</strong> no</a> </span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Shadow)</span></span></span></span>, a 12-minute drama about a photographer&rsquo;s confrontation with an abusive authority, became the first Filipino film to win the Palme d&rsquo;Or for best short film at the Cannes Film Festival. The following year, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4375\">Mes de Guzman</a>&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Batang Trapo</span></span> (Rags) won the L&rsquo;Etoile d&rsquo;Or at the Marrakech International Film Festival. In 2007, Clermont-Ferrand International Short Film Festival&mdash;the &ldquo;Cannes&rdquo; of short film festivals&mdash;gave honor to Filipino short films as part of the Asian Panorama with the screenings of Red&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><strong>Anino</strong> </span></span>, de Guzman&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Batang Trapo</span></span>, Cesar Hernando&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Kagat ng Dilim </span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Fangs of Darkness)</span></span></span></span>, Tad Ermita&ntilde;o&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Local Unit</span></span>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4428\">Lawrence Fajardo</a>&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Kultado </span></span><span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\"><span style=\"font-weight:normal\"><span style=\"font-style:normal\">(Curdled)</span></span></span></span>, Jeck Cogama&rsquo;s <span class=\"movietitle\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">Putot,</span></span> Mark V.
