Manila: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a> Folk Arts Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is a collection of writings and pictures by the founder and members of the Bayanihan Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. Bayanihan founder Helena Benitez opens the collection with an essay that looks back at Bayanihan&rsquo;s 30 years of experience and explains the mission and meaning of the company. &ldquo;Bayanihan&rdquo; signifies a way of life, a synonym for &ldquo;folk,&rdquo; and the pride of Filipinos both in the Philippines and abroad. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3039\"><strong>Jose Lardizabal</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Barefoot on a High Plateau&rdquo; prefaces the book reminiscing about the Bayanihan&rsquo;s 1959 performance in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first section titled the &ldquo;Bayanihan Story&rdquo; by executive director Leticia Perez de Guzman claims that dance as part of the Filipino way of life is crucial in rediscovering our nation. The nationalist fervor in the 1940s and 1950s paved the way for the establishment of a national dance company. The Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU), then headed by Conrado and Francisca Benitez, spearheaded a project to explore and preserve the nation&rsquo;s culture. Although folk dance had already been taught for 30 years on campus and the University&rsquo;s Filipiniana Folk Music and Dance Committee had presented programs inspired by the studies of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\"><strong>Francisca Reyes-Aquino</strong></a>, more efforts in cultural retrieval were made. Composer Lucrecia Kasilag, dance-researcher Aurora Dino, and ethnolinguist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> did more research into music and dance in Mindoro, Palawan, and the Mountain Province. Further research on costumes and dances were later conducted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a> and Manuel Cordova in the Southern Philippines. From the PWU Physical Education Club&rsquo;s regular weekend performances of the retrieved dances, the group produced <strong><em>Magbayahihan Tayo</em></strong> (Let&rsquo;s Help Each Other) to honor Pres Ramon Magsaysay in 1956. They presented <strong><em>Bayanihan: A Philippine Music and Dance Festival</em></strong> at the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Professions in 1957 and founded the Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company in 1958. By the time the company toured Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the United States in 1959, it had transformed dances gathered from the field into theatrical performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The section titled &ldquo;Before Curtain-Rise, Backstage: The Planning, Artists&rdquo; includes essays by people behind the company. Bayanihan&rsquo;s artistic director Jose Lardizabal recalls how he was conscripted to help prepare the company for the 1958 Brussels Fair. He recounts how he taught company members the art of performing on stage. Choreographer and dance director Reyes-Urtula explains how Bayanihan had to assiduously learn dances and rituals from indigenous peoples, and to regularly consult the leaders of cultural communities before adapting the dances into modern and elaborate theater presentations. Reyes-Urtula discusses compression, enhancement, and highlighting as the major processes involved in transposing the dances from their original location to the theater. Music director Kasilag discusses the challenges of crafting music for the dance group. Working with indigenous and folk music, Kasilag tried to preserve tradition in the process of raising the music to the level of stage performance. Kasilag accomplished this by highlighting tone, color, and intensity through instrumentation. She elaborates on the sounds of indigenous instruments and folk songs unique to the different regions and how these are combined with Bayanihan&rsquo;s Western-derived music. Costume director Isabel Santos narrates how she travelled around the Philippines in search of authentic materials that she could transform into garments for dancing. Considering the needs of the stage and the quick changes demanded by the repertoire, costume designs must be wearable and practical. Zippers and Velcro fasteners were easy devices used for all Bayanihan costumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The section &ldquo;Oh Peregrine: High Notes and Anecdotes (Now and Then a Milestone),&rdquo; comprises short writings on the exciting life of Bayanihan artists when abroad. Kasilag, Lardizabal, Reyes-Urtula, Rodrigo Perez III, Lourdes Guillermo, Nina Capistrano, Leni Cabili, Nina Yuson, and Corky Trinidad share unforgettable experiences in the face of challenges in creating dances, composing music, performing on stage, or dealing with adjustments needed in mounting productions abroad. The book ends with short but substantial entries on the people behind the dance company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the sections &ldquo;Bayanihan in Black and White&rdquo; and &ldquo;Across Six Continents,&rdquo; vibrant photographs document performances and tours of the company. Through the Bayanihan&rsquo;s numerous performances around the world, the Filipino spirit has been made known to other cultures<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ruth Jordana L.

The nationalist fervor in the 1940s and 1950s paved the way for the establishment of a national dance company. The Philippine Women&#x2019;s University (PWU), then headed by Conrado and Francisca Benitez, spearheaded a project to explore and preserve the nation&#x2019;s culture. Although folk dance had already been taught for 30 years on campus and the University&#x2019;s Filipiniana Folk Music and Dance Committee had presented programs inspired by the studies of <a href=\"/6/51/2570\"><strong>Francisca Reyes-Aquino</strong></a>, more efforts in cultural retrieval were made. Composer Lucrecia Kasilag, dance-researcher Aurora Dino, and ethnolinguist <a href=\"/5/42/4056\"><strong>Jose Maceda</strong></a> did more research into music and dance in Mindoro, Palawan, and the Mountain Province. Further research on costumes and dances were later conducted by <a href=\"/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a> and Manuel Cordova in the Southern Philippines. From the PWU Physical Education Club&#x2019;s regular weekend performances of the retrieved dances, the group produced <strong><em>Magbayahihan Tayo</em></strong> (Let&#x2019;s Help Each Other) to honor Pres Ramon Magsaysay in 1956. They presented <strong><em>Bayanihan: A Philippine Music and Dance Festival</em></strong> at the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Professions in 1957 and founded the Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company in 1958. By the time the company toured Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the United States in 1959, it had transformed dances gathered from the field into theatrical performances."

Bayanihan&#x2019;s artistic director Jose Lardizabal recalls how he was conscripted to help prepare the company for the 1958 Brussels Fair. He recounts how he taught company members the art of performing on stage. Choreographer and dance director Reyes-Urtula explains how Bayanihan had to assiduously learn dances and rituals from indigenous peoples, and to regularly consult the leaders of cultural communities before adapting the dances into modern and elaborate theater presentations. Reyes-Urtula discusses compression, enhancement, and highlighting as the major processes involved in transposing the dances from their original location to the theater. Music director Kasilag discusses the challenges of crafting music for the dance group. Working with indigenous and folk music, Kasilag tried to preserve tradition in the process of raising the music to the level of stage performance. Kasilag accomplished this by highlighting tone, color, and intensity through instrumentation. She elaborates on the sounds of indigenous instruments and folk songs unique to the different regions and how these are combined with Bayanihan&#x2019;s Western-derived music. Costume director Isabel Santos narrates how she travelled around the Philippines in search of authentic materials that she could transform into garments for dancing. Considering the needs of the stage and the quick changes demanded by the repertoire, costume designs must be wearable and practical. Zippers and Velcro fasteners were easy devices used for all Bayanihan costumes."

Manila: University of Santo Tomas Publishing House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The documentation of vanishing folk practices, rituals, and similar traditional forms by dance scholars and performing artists has enabled Agnes Locsin to draw materials and movements from the country&rsquo;s different cultural groups and to recreate or reinvent them into a body of neo-ethnic dance works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The author immersed in indigenous communities to study their dances that are usually prayers of petitions for a good harvest, thanksgiving, rites of passage or healing. From these field experiences, Locsin came up with a new (&ldquo;neo&rdquo;) vocabulary of stylized movements indebted to ethnic sources. These movements are fused with Western and modern dance techniques which enhanced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a>&rsquo; repertoire of theater-dance productions such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Moriones, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong> (Enchantress), <strong><em>Paglalakbay</em></strong> (Journey), <strong><em>Taong Talangka</em></strong> (Human Crab), <strong><em>Elias</em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/160\"><strong>La Revolucion Filipina</strong></a></em></strong> (The Philippine Revolution).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is divided into 10 chapters. All these chapters take the reader behind the scenes of the performances and production of the shows. &ldquo;Ten Steps to Choreography&rdquo; explains the process of creating a work from conceptualization, to research and immersion, to experiencing the scenographic space, to organizing the composition which includes inviting criticism and preparing for the performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Transforming Ethnic to Neo-Ethnic&rdquo; presents a number of methods that have proven helpful in her neo-ethnic choreography: stylizing, recreating/reinventing, and recapturing the qualities of tribal dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Neo-Ethnic Choreography&rdquo; provides two major examples of neo-ethnic works Locsin is known for: <strong><em>Igorot</em></strong> and <strong><em>Bagobo</em></strong>. The chapter presents the complex process involved in creating both works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Preparing for <strong><em>Encantada</em></strong> &rdquo; is an extensive discussion of several of Locsin&rsquo;s works preceding <strong><em>Encantada</em></strong>. The works whose progeny and development are explained in detail in the chapter are <strong><em>Moriones</em></strong> and <strong><em>Hinilawod</em></strong>, choreographic creations which enabled Locsin to try out some ideas she already had in mind for <strong><em>Encantada</em></strong>, her major production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chapter &ldquo; <strong><em>Encantada</em></strong> &rdquo; traces the beginnings of the work to 1977, the year when Locsin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\"><strong>Al Santos</strong></a> did their first collaborative work on a rock opera at the Ateneo de Davao University. Fifteen years later, when their proposal to restage the work with Ballet Philippines was declined by the company, Santos suggested Encantada, a work that will draw from some of Locsin&rsquo;s earlier creations, including the Moriones and Hinilawod.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Dances as Postscripts&rdquo; elaborates on <strong><em>Paglalakbay</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></a></em></strong>. The chapter provides the reader with details on these choreographic pieces, as results of collaborative efforts between researchers, musicians, chanters, set and costume designers, and dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Choreography for Competition&rdquo; explains the dynamics between choice of music and choreography. While Locsin generally starts with movements, in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/121\"><strong>Babalyan</strong></a></em></strong> (Shaman), the music came first, chosen from among the five pieces sent by the competition organizers. <strong><em>Babalyan</em></strong> was created for the 1993 Tokyo International Choreography Competition. Other works done for competition are <strong><em>Taong Talangka</em></strong> for Camille Ordinario&rsquo;s participation in the 6th Paris International <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>Modern Dance</strong></a> Competition and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1277\"><strong>Salome</strong></a></em></strong> for her second round entry in the same contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chapters on &ldquo; <strong><em>Elias</em></strong> &rdquo; and &ldquo; <strong><em>La Revolucion Filipina</em></strong> &rdquo; explore the development of neo-ethnic movements in rendering two narratives based on Philippine history. Notable about <strong><em>La Revolucion</em></strong><strong><em>Filipina</em></strong> was how Locsin was able to make the character of the paralytic hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\"><strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong></a> &ldquo;dance.&rdquo; The battle of wills between Mabini and Aguinaldo was shown through the adept use of a hammock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Postscript&rdquo; looks back at Locsin&rsquo;s years of choreography, and the criticisms she had to face regarding her use of the term &ldquo;neo-ethnic&rdquo; and her so-called exoticization of materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the qualities of indigenous dances that the Davao-based choreographer learned are their repetitiveness and their being earthbound. The last is crucial. Unlike the movements of classical ballet that are ethereal and airborne, these steps require that the feet and toes touch the ground and feel the earth. If there are jumps, these are followed by crouching movements with bent knees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book includes short, first-person accounts from her creative collaborators like musician Joey Ayala; dancers Je An Salas, Annette <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3489\"><strong>Cruz Maria</strong></a>no, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2526\"><strong>Ernest Mandap</strong></a>, Judell de Guzman-Sicam, Annie Divinagracia Sartorio, Grethel Domingo-Rampon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2478\"><strong>Biag Gaongen</strong></a>, Unita <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2476\"><strong>Gaye Galiluyo</strong></a>, and Camille Ordinario-Joson; and actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2804\"><strong>Nonie Buencamino</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the dancers&rsquo; recollections, the common thread of their experience is how they had to reorient themselves from classical to modern ballet, shifting from lightness and pointed toes to groundedness and flexed toes. Rampon describes the Filipino dancers&rsquo; edge over classically trained French dancers in <strong><em>Paglalakbay</em></strong> &mdash;how naturally ethnic movements were expressed by the Filipinos, how hard it was for the French to do non-balletic hand movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buencamino, a non-dancer who learned modern ballet for his acting-dancing role of Emilio Aguinaldo in <strong><em>La Revolucion Filipina</em></strong>, grew to respect the demands made on dancers to express the different aspects of literature through movements alone, unlike actors who have the luxury of discussing their characters&rsquo; motivations before rehearsals. Ayala describes Locsin as having the ability to crystallize &ldquo;dance and shape it in her painstaking and patient detailing of movement, the process of which I find inspiring. She is a good giant on whose shoulders we might stand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin&rsquo;s definition of the neo-ethnic dance idiom is reinforced by black and white photographs which document the final productions and also illustrate how tribal movements are transposed and turned into modern steps. In the last chapter, she reflects on the place of neo-ethnic dance in the 21st century and states that although there still is a need for neo-ethnic choreography, she is also open to alternative terms and labels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is not only a handy how-to guide for other choreographers who may want to take the neo-ethnic path but also Locsin&rsquo;s contribution to the narrative of dance in the Philippines.

Author, Theodore S. Gonzalves. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book&rsquo;s Prologue provides a social and historical background for the study, from the 1898 battle for Manila, to the seditious plays of 1902 to 1916, and over a century later, the year 1997. This framing later questions the nation&rsquo;s official account of the seemingly timeless &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo; between the Philippines and the United States. The introduction interweaves diverse historical accounts of national and global issues, intergenerational dialogues and antagonisms, youth culture, dance theory, ethnography, security and international relations, agricultural and service labor, migration, mass-based struggles, civil rights, and social justice. With this background, Gonzalves traces the genealogy of the &ldquo;Pilipino Cultural Night&rdquo; (PCN), a cultural programming popular among Filipino students in the United States and Canada since the 1980s. The book&rsquo;s title parodies the short story &ldquo;The Day the Dancers Came&rdquo; by the Filipino American writer Bienvenido Santos, first published in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first chapter, &ldquo;The Art of the State: Inventing Folkloric Forms (Manila, 1934),&rdquo; focuses on the creation of a &ldquo;national performance repertoire,&rdquo; and a touristic popularization of a dance-theater form. It accounts for the creation of PCN by narrating the foundational work undertaken by educators in the 1930s, such as the romantic nationalist and then president of the University of the Philippines Jorge Bocobo, and the physical educator and folklorist Francisca Reyes (later Mrs. Tolentino, then Mrs. Aquino). Both are credited with the invention of a national folkloric repertoire, which proved to be a crucial tool to instill &ldquo;kinetic nationalism&rdquo; into Filipino bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second chapter, &ldquo;Take It from the People: Dancing Diplomats and the Cultural Authenticity (Brussels, 1958),&rdquo; discusses the folk dances adapted into &ldquo;dance-theater&rdquo; as they migrated from schools to the concert halls in the 1950s and 1960s. This is exemplified by the celebrated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Philippine Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> based in the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, and the Far Eastern University Dance Troupe. Owing to political sponsors and educators in Manila who invented a national dance theater, they showed the range of Philippine traditions in the international scene. Other troupes that followed in the international scene were the Baranggay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Troupe, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2468\"><strong>Filipinescas Dance Company</strong></a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2604\"><strong>Tambuli Cultural Troupe</strong></a>. Their work defined for PCN the performative vocabulary of Philippine culture. Against this scenario, folkloric forms were reinterpreted by US-based students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third chapter, &ldquo;Dancing into Oblivion: The Pilipino Cultural Night (Los Angeles, 1983),&rdquo; focuses on a PCN called &ldquo;Kasaysayan ng Lahi&rdquo; (History of the People) at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA). It marked the beginning of a unique genre of Filipino-American expression and showed a dynamic version of Filipino-American culture in the wake of unabated immigration of underemployed Filipino professionals. The chapter elaborates on how the PCN became a source of improvised kinetic education. The shows mirrored cross-cultural struggles&mdash;racial, political, social, and economic&mdash;experienced by Filipino migrants and Filipino-Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fourth chapter, &ldquo;Repetitive Motion: The Mechanics of Reverse Exile (San Francisco, 1993),&rdquo; highlights a few major elements of the PCN and discloses the PCN&rsquo;s degeneration into ritualistic artifacts. The story which includes the history of Filipino student organizations related to the PCN contextualizes the migrations of Filipinos to the US. The chapter details the time, manpower, and logistics expended for performances, the major elements that furthered the development of the PCN, plus the internal and external criticisms about it. The chapter also elucidates on the &ldquo;reverse exile&rdquo; motif, familiar in the PCN genre. Reflected in this is the quest for cultural identity or the &ldquo;missing&rdquo; something and the &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; of Filipino-Americans, meant to be resolved by an imagined return to the idyllic Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fifth chapter, &ldquo;Making a Mockery of Everything We Hold True and Dear, Exploring Parody with the Tongue in the Mood (TM) production of &lsquo;PCN Salute&rsquo; (San Francisco, 1997),&rdquo; presents a comedy theater group that satirized the PCN performances. It was &ldquo;parody from the inside&rdquo; cued from Dario Fo, the Italian playwright and Nobel Prize winner for literature in 1997. Spiritedly narrated was the work of Tongue in the Mood, a group composed of veteran PCN artists. &ldquo;PCN Salute&rdquo; spoofed the PCN, implying that it needs to be dynamic with its repertoire and identities going beyond entertainment and should ask questions about power, place, and imagination. With TM, the PCN found its own cultural critique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In tracing the genealogy of the PCN genre as an expressive cultural form developed by Filipino-Americans, the book shows that the function of imported cultural practices is fickle, as each generation of teachers and students adroitly remix and reinvent those &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; cultural forms or &ldquo;official modes&rdquo; of conceiving the past. In &ldquo;Epilogue: Memoria,&rdquo; Gonzalves describes the phantom pain of his father, a retired sergeant in the US Army who lost his left arm in an accident. Gonzalves connects this to his own muscle memory during his piano lessons. It is muscle memory in the hands, the fingers, and the wrists that carries the information enabling the body to connect to the environment, called &ldquo;proprioception.&rdquo; Both phantom pain and muscle memory are used to explain Gonzalves&rsquo;s and the PCN performers&rsquo; ability to embrace or connect to expressive folkloric forms or performance vocabulary of Philippine culture, as if they had experienced these before. It is as if the Philippine traditions incorporated in the PCN repertoire were, and still are, part of themselves.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2398\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> Fernando Amilbangsa</strong></a></strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

In &#x201C;Epilogue: Memoria,&#x201D; Gonzalves describes the phantom pain of his father, a retired sergeant in the US Army who lost his left arm in an accident. Gonzalves connects this to his own muscle memory during his piano lessons. It is muscle memory in the hands, the fingers, and the wrists that carries the information enabling the body to connect to the environment, called &#x201C;proprioception.&#x201D; Both phantom pain and muscle memory are used to explain Gonzalves&#x2019;s and the PCN performers&#x2019; ability to embrace or connect to expressive folkloric forms or performance vocabulary of Philippine culture, as if they had experienced these before. It is as if the Philippine traditions incorporated in the PCN repertoire were, and still are, part of themselves.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/6/51/2397\"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href=\"/6/51/2398\"><strong></strong></a><strong><a href=\"/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> Fernando Amilbangsa</strong></strong></strong> </em>"

Author, Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz. Manila: University of Santo Tomas Publishing House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This collection, by dancer, choreographer, critic, and professor of dance Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz, is a three-volume compendium of essays, reviews, dance and theater history, and social biographies of artists written from the 1960s to the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first volume is divided into four parts: &ldquo;Thoughts on Dance,&rdquo; &ldquo;Criticism,&rdquo; &ldquo;Choreography,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dance Reviews.&rdquo; It sets forth the theoretical framework used in the analyses of dance and theater in the Philippines. Part one shares with the reader ways of seeing dance, its clarity and complexity, its ephemerality, and legacy. Villaruz calls for the understanding of various dance genres characterized by several styles, diverse movement expressions, and numerous motivations. Part two has critical essays and illustrates the demanding task of critical reading and writing, both requiring a deep knowledge of dance history, aesthetics, culture, anthropology, and dance reception and consumption. Villaruz stresses the reality that a Filipino dance critic is a juggler of professions; he may be a dancer/choreographer, teacher, and critic all at the same time. Part three consists of reviews on choreographic works against their political and cultural backgrounds. In these essays, Villaruz is consistent in his critical stance on the creation of a national dance company which he feels will curtail the development of dance in the country. In the last part of the volume, Villaruz pays tribute to Filipino dance artists who have remained committed to their art, both in the Philippines and abroad. Some of them are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2618\"><strong>Anna Villadolid</strong></a>, Rupert Acu&ntilde;a, Nicolas Paca&ntilde;a, Hazel Zabas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2519\"><strong>Jojo Lucila</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\"><strong>Alden Lugnasin</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2575\"><strong>Dwight Rodrigazo</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><strong>Myra Beltran</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second volume has three parts: &ldquo;Dance History/<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Marks,&rdquo; &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dance Reviews.&rdquo; The volume addresses the nature and function of choreographic art as public expression or exhibition. In part one, Villaruz discusses Philippine dance history in terms of the creative output of dancers, performing groups, and institutions. In all of these essays, Villaruz recognizes the distinct talent of the Filipino dancer and choreographer. In part two, the readings highlight the contribution of the country&rsquo;s various folk dance groups to the preservation of the country&rsquo;s cultural heritage, as exemplified by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Philippine Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</strong></a>, and the Filipinescas. Nonetheless, Villaruz calls attention to a very basic issue yet to be resolved: the definition of &ldquo;folk&rdquo; or &ldquo;ethnographic subject.&rdquo; He suggests a more critical awareness of the difference between revival, survival, and transformation in dealing with the staging of rituals, rural, and &ldquo;ethnic dances.&rdquo; In the last part of the volume, Villaruz&rsquo;s dance reviews reveal an informed critical position based on years of experience in both choreography and performance. The analysis of every performance is a mix of dance history, lessons in aesthetics, explorations of movement, analyses of bodies, commentaries on stage design, evaluation of music, and discussions on the politics of dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third volume has two parts: &ldquo;Thoughts on Theater&rdquo; and &ldquo;Theater Reviews.&rdquo; The volume shows the critic&rsquo;s knowledge of both literature and theater as these are either read or viewed as performances. The essays in the first part expound on Villaruz&rsquo;s general ideas on theater, its nature, its process of creation and production, and the mindset of its audience. The essays take the reader from the 1960s to the 1990s. He laments the Filipinos&rsquo; lack of commitment to theater but eventually becomes more optimistic as theater became more audacious and adventurous. In &ldquo;Theater Reviews,&rdquo; he comments on the playwright&rsquo;s text, the performers&rsquo; acting, the director&rsquo;s choices, the choreography, staging techniques, stage design, music, and singing. A significant contribution to the history of theater in the Philippines, the essays document what the Filipinos have achieved in the performing arts. Theater companies&mdash;huge and small, old and new, traditional and experimental&mdash;attest to such achievement. Some of these companies are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\"><strong>Repertory Philippines</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Pilipino, Philippine Educational Theater Association, UP Repertory, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\"><strong>Dulaang UP</strong></a>, UP Tropa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3336\"><strong>UP Mobile Theater</strong></a>, and Kaliwat Theater Collective. Villaruz also gives ample recognition to the directors who have kept Philippine theater alive and dynamic. Some of them are Zenaida Amador, Baby Barredo, Rolando Tinio, Tony Mabesa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3251\"><strong>Jonas Sebastian</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\"><strong>Behn Cervantes</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3141\"><strong>Nonon Padilla</strong></a>, Anton Juan, Alex Cortez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\"><strong>Auraeus Solito</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4539\"><strong>Chris Martinez</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the three-volume collection covers both mainstream and non-mainstream performances and artists, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/23\"><strong>Walking Through Philippine Theater</strong></a></em></strong> is a valuable contribution to the scholarship on dance and theater in the Philippines.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ruth Jordana L.
