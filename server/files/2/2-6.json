In this process, materials are prepared, formed, and assembled in various ways or methods to create habitable structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"structural\" name=\"structural\"></a>Structural Forms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A building consists of space and structure. The form of space is defined by the structure that encloses it. The extent of space covered by the structure is determined by the strength of its materials or by the manner in which such materials are put together. There are several forms or systems of construction. Post-and-lintel construction consists of a horizontal member, called lintel or beam, supported at both ends by vertical members, called posts or columns. On the horizontal member rests a load consisting of a section of a wall, floor, or roof. Indigenous houses, like the <strong>bahay kubo</strong>, and stone and wooden buildings, like the <strong>bahay na bato</strong>, employ this type of construction. Greek temples made of marble were built using this form. This basic pattern is followed in the steel skeletons for high-rise buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An arch is a curved structure used to span openings or to support a wall or roof. The arch was developed by ancient builders, particularly the Romans, who, aware of the limited tensile strength of stone, nonetheless devised a way of using it to span considerable widths. The early form of arch consisted of wedge-shaped blocks, arranged in a curve, with their joints perpendicular to the curve. With such construction, the downward thrust of the weight was resolved into horizontal or diagonal pressures, enabling the builders to cover larger spans than did the post-and-lintel system. The Romans used arches for various structures such as large halls, bridges, and aqueducts. In the Philippines, the arch was introduced during the Spanish colonial period. It was used for openings, structural supports, arcades, and bridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vault is a curved-stone structure covering a space. The vault developed from the arch, using the same principle of construction. A vault may be described as an arch extended along its depth. The simplest form of vault is the tunnel vault or barrel vault. The walls of Intramuros contain a number of vaults. While stone vaults were common features in European churches, very few Philippine churches use them because of the danger caused by earthquakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dome is a vault of hemispherical shape. It may be visualized as an arch turned on its axis. The earliest domes were made of stone, following the principle of the arch. Modern domes are made of reinforced concrete or steel. The dome of the Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice at the University of the Philippines is a reinforced-concrete shell, only 24 cm thick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A truss is a frame composed of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal members, used in the construction of roofs and bridges. Since the triangle is the most stable shape in construction, the various parts of a truss form an assemblage of triangles. The overall form of an ordinary roof truss is a triangle. A truss may also have the form of a wide curve like an arch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cantilever is a slab, beam, truss, or any structural member projecting beyond its support, whether it is a wall, column, or girder. Cantilevers are used for wide roof overhangs, canopies, and balconies. The use of cantilevers makes modern buildings more exciting in appearance since a structure supported on only one side gives the impression of being suspended or being afloat. Whereas traditional buildings solidly supported on all sides are awesome for their stability, modern buildings employing cantilevers suggest movement, particularly a horizontal thrust. Cantilevers serve a practical purpose since they provide covered space free from any obstruction on its open sides, allowing unimpeded movement. For this reason they are standard devices for entrances and waiting areas. The front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a><strong><strong> </strong> </strong> main building is dominated by a huge cantilevered block sheltering the entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A space frame is a three-dimensional structural framework in which all members are interconnected to maximize stability and to effect resistance to loads applied in any direction. While the members of a truss lie on one plane, comprising height and width, the members of a space frame function in terms of height, width, and depth. The steel skeleton of a multistory building is a type of space frame. However, the term is more properly applied to a construction consisting of two parallel grids connected by diagonal or zigzagging bars. Space frames can span widths of a hundred meters or more, and have been used in the construction of domes. Because of its light construction, the space frame is one of the most economical structures for covering wide expanses. With its active play of lines and pleasing design, it is regarded as a work of technological art and can therefore be left exposed. Computer-aided design (CAD) rendering has contributed to the increasing use of space frames since the long, complex calculations, needed in their design, can now be rapidly accomplished.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>The Indigenous Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous architecture is based on a precise knowledge of the durability, strength, and possible use of materials found in the environment, like wood, leaves, rocks, and sometimes mud. As in most of Southeast Asia, the most common material is bamboo, which is used for beams, flooring, siding, and roofing. They may be used whole, split, flattened, or woven into <strong>sawali</strong> or <strong>amakan</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building materials for ethnic houses include coconut wood and leaves;&nbsp;<em>bakawan&nbsp;</em>(mangrove); wood such as narra, pine, molave, for posts, beams and flooring;&nbsp;<em>pawid&nbsp;</em>or nipa, cogon grass, husk, and banana bark for sidings; and palm fronds, anahaw, and&nbsp;<em>runo&nbsp;</em>(cane grass) for roofing. The use of these materials may be seen in the<strong> </strong>Ifugao house, which has a roof of cogon, walls and floors of wooden planks, and four sturdy wooden posts that raise it above the ground. The Tausug <strong>bay sinug</strong> has a porch made of bamboo and built on bamboo posts and a living area resting on sturdy posts of wood. The kitchen, a separate structure connected by a bridge to the main house, is made of bamboo or wooden planks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sama, whose houses are built on piles driven into the reef floor, use coconut wood, mangrove, or other trees for posts, and nipa and sawali for sidings and roofing. The <strong>daet-daet</strong> or lean-to of the Mamanua Negrito is an impromptu windscreen of leaves of wild banana, coconut fronds, or grass laid on a framework of twigs. The <strong>bahay kubo</strong> or nipa hut, the indigenous house of the lowland Filipino, utilizes its building materials with great skill. Split bamboo might be woven into pleasing chevron or diamond-shaped patterns. Regional variations in the use of material are evident. In the Tagalog region, sidings are generally of nipa while in the Visayas, these are made of bamboo: either split, flattened, or woven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous houses are usually built with assistance from relatives and friends while the owner provides food and drink. This system of communal help is called&nbsp;<em>bayanihan&nbsp;</em>by lowland Filipinos. Master carpenters might be engaged for complex work that demands expertise and might be paid for their labor. Skills are passed on from generation to generation or from master to apprentice as among the carvers of the <strong>panolong</strong>, the decorative beam-end, found in the Maranao <strong>torogan</strong> (datu&rsquo;s large house).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>The Hispanic Colonial Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The buildings during the 300 years of Spanish rule were so excellently shaped according to the materials and techniques available in the country that Rafael Diaz Arenas was moved to conclude in 1850 that &ldquo;the Philippines has its own architecture.&rdquo; The Spanish businessman says that the architects and engineers in the colony were able to appropriately address the various concerns about the climate and environment in their constructions, from the palaces of the various government and religious leaders, to private homes, and public structures. The house parts were so well linked with each other that they were considered earthquake resistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Haligi Construction</strong>. The first houses, churches, and buildings under Spanish rule hewed closely to indigenous design. A temporary shed would have a <strong>balangkas</strong> or framework with posts of bamboo. A thin wall (<strong>dingding</strong>, <strong>dindin</strong>, or <strong>bungbong</strong>) utilized light materials such as palm leaves or grass. A sheet of woven slats of bamboo for the wall or ceiling was known as sawali among the Tagalog, and amakan among the Visayans. Instead of nails, which were not used until much later, wooden pegs and dovetailed joints kept the pieces in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Filipino <strong>anloagui</strong> (carpenter) was an expert at determining which wood was best suited for a particular function. For a sturdy housepost (<strong>adigi</strong>, <strong>haligi</strong>, or <strong>harigi</strong>), choices would range from palms like the&nbsp;<em>anibung&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>sagisi</em>, to the wood known as molave or&nbsp;<em>mulawin&nbsp;</em>which was distasteful to termites, hardened with age and did not rot although imbedded in the ground. As technology improved, these haligi were set into bases of lime and stone. Narra or&nbsp;<em>naga&nbsp;</em>(<strong>apalit</strong> among the Kapampangan) was a favorite for the <strong>tabla</strong> (floorboard), because of its deep red color and sheen when polished. Narra came in red and yellow; both types would be laid in alternation to give the floor more character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine forests yielded lumber known for its durability, sheen, color, and beauty. A basic list of trees useful for construction would include: <strong>acle</strong> or <strong>acli</strong> for buildings and ships; <strong>amugis</strong> for planks; <strong>apitong</strong>, a generic name for lumber from the <strong>panau</strong> tree and other dipterocarps used for lumber; <strong>baticulin</strong> or <strong>batikuling</strong> for sculpture and furniture; <strong>bansaluguin</strong> or <strong>bansalagin</strong> for wood bolts and handles of hammers and axes; <strong>calantas</strong> for cigar boxes, frames, and furnishings; <strong>camagong</strong> or <strong>ebano</strong> for furniture; <strong>dongol</strong>, <strong>dongon</strong> or <strong>dungon</strong> for house posts, ties, bridges, ships, and other construction; <strong>guijo</strong> or <strong>guiso</strong> for house construction; <strong>ipil</strong> for house posts, doors, and other construction; <strong>kakauati</strong> or <strong>madre de cacao</strong> for beams; <strong>lanete</strong> or <strong>laniti</strong> for furniture; <strong>lauan</strong>, a generic name for a number of species used for construction; <strong>magcono</strong>, <strong>magkano</strong>, or <strong>mangkono</strong>, a tree found in the Visayas and Mindanao used for pillars and house posts; <strong>mangachapoi</strong>, from a species of&nbsp;<em>Hopea&nbsp;</em>used for planks, bridges, and other construction; <strong>supa</strong> for furniture, boards, and other construction; <strong>tindalo</strong> or <strong>balayong</strong> (<strong>tugas</strong> among the Visayans) for furniture; and <strong>yacal</strong> or <strong>yakal</strong>, from different species of&nbsp;<em>Hopea&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Shorea&nbsp;</em>used for rafters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some buildings were even aromatic. The Dutch stopped burning the Church of Capul in 1642 when they realized it was built of sandalwood, and took the boards with them instead. The qualities of such trees were passed on in friar chronicles, culminating in Fr Manuel Blanco&rsquo;s <strong><em>Flora de Filipinas</em></strong>. Crates of samples were brought to the Philippine Exposition in 1887 in Madrid, in whose museums they can still be accessed today. Although these trees continue to be used for present-day construction and for the same purposes given, many more are unfortunately becoming rare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trozos</strong> or logs felled in the forests were ideally floated down river, tied to bamboo rafts. Hauling timber over land reached epic proportions. For instance, in order to transport the lumber for the convento of Santa Barbara in Pangasinan from Villasis, a distance of some 25 kilometers, 200 carabaos and 100 men were needed, and the parish priest was hoarse for 15 days. A rousing march from the town band spelled all the difference between extricating a log mired in mud and leaving it there forever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lumber could not be worked on immediately, because it had to be left to dry for two or more years to prevent warping. Wood was treated against insects with <strong>alquitran</strong> (tar), or it was buried in the sand pits of a river, or its sap was bled in saltwater. It was smoothened with the dried skin of the <strong>pagi</strong> or stingray. Surfaces were varnished with <strong>malapajo</strong> obtained from the resin of the <strong>balao</strong> tree; other finishes came from the sap of trees like the <strong>agacahac</strong> and <strong>apitong</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Houses and churches had roofs made of the long fronds of palms like the coconut, nipa, or <strong>lumbia,</strong> which was similar to the nipa except that it produced sago starch. The leaves of the lumbia could last up to eight years, twice than those of the nipa, and even longer if exposed to the smoke in the kitchen. In 17th century Visayas, as noted by Alzina in the 1660s, layers of <strong>bagakay</strong> bamboo slats were fastened on the rafters like roof shingles. Fused together and rendered offensive to termites by constant rain and smoke, these roofs could last up to 10 years without being changed. Much further north, in Paoay (Ilocos Norte), an expedition in 1710 noted how the church roof of thick <strong>ca&ntilde;a boxo</strong> (buho) bamboo had been protected against fire by a layer of lime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Calicanto Construction.</strong> The great Manila conflagration of 1583, however, showed the vulnerability of these wooden houses to fire. The first bishop of Manila Domingo de Salazar, who landed in 1581, encountered useful stone quarries along the banks of the Pasig in San Pedro Makati and Guadalupe. The Jesuit Antonio Sede&ntilde;o, who arrived with Bp de Salazar, is credited for having introduced masonry to the Philippines: cutting stone, preparing the lime mixture, laying and aligning the stone blocks, and forming bricks and roof tiles. Contemporary scholars, however, remind us that this knowledge was not new to the Chinese, who already must have brought these skills with them to the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rocks destined for construction were pried loose (<strong>arrancada</strong>) from quarries (<strong>canteras</strong> or <strong>tibagan</strong>). From here they were dragged (<strong>arrastrada</strong>) or transported in carts (<strong>acarreada</strong>) to a clearing where they were hewn (<strong>labrada</strong>) into blocks. Blocks of stone were sold according to their sizes and use: <strong>sillares</strong> (about 1 x 1/2 x 1/2 yards, for facades and arches), <strong>sillaretes</strong> (for window frames), or <strong>tablillas</strong> (where we get the Visayan term <strong>tabriya</strong> or <strong>tabliya</strong>, describing the sheathing of pavements). These were floated along waterways, usually in Chinese-owned sampans, to landing places next to commercial centers such as the Puerta de Almacenes in Intramuros or the Estero de Binondo on the opposite bank of the Pasig. Buildings of cut stone were described as <strong>de silleria</strong>, <strong>de canteria</strong>, or <strong>de cal y canto</strong>, sometimes spelled <strong>calicanto</strong>. A mason was called a <strong>cantero</strong> or <strong>alba&ntilde;il</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the buildings in Manila and Central Luzon were made of volcanic stuff, locally known as adobe. When freshly quarried, the material resembled the dried mud-and-straw bricks used in Mexico, which went by the same name. The whiter the stone, the more durable the construction. The hardiest variety was the <strong>bulik</strong>; less preferred were the <strong>gasang</strong> and the <strong>palanas</strong>, because they were prone to powdering. This weakness was countered by the application of a protective lime layer called <strong>palitada</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limestone was a material that lent itself to fine cutting and carving. It was known by various names, depending on the region: <strong>apog</strong>, <strong>anapog</strong>, <strong>bato nga bukay</strong>, <strong>igang</strong>, or <strong>manunggul</strong>. So durable was this material that it did not need a layer of palitada. It could be obtained from inland quarries: the island of Guimaras was the source for limestone, which was brought to the adjacent province of Iloilo. It was also quarried from coral reefs during low tide. Dams were raised to hold back seawater, while the rocks were being cut loose. Coral was then shaped into blocks at the shore. In the Visayas the art of cutting coral was transformed into a virtual fine art, with blocks known as <strong>piedra de visayas</strong> fitting so precisely into each other that not even a razor blade could be inserted between them. Earlier churches, such as that of Baclayon in Bohol, used large blocks. But 19th century churches, like Anini-y in Antique and Lazi in Siquijor, used blocks of smaller size. The mid-19th century church of Loon, also in Bohol, with its subtle facade undulations was certainly one of the most sophisticated of its kind; unfortunately, it was totally destroyed in the earthquake of 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Masonry was brought to Mindanao by Visayan settlers and the religious missionaries who worked among them. The church of Jimenez in Misamis Occidental is a fine example. Reef limestone churches were also built along the coastal areas of Luzon, notably Paoay in Ilocos Norte, Masinloc in Zambales, Balayan in Batangas, Gumaca in Quezon, and Indan in Camarines Norte. Piedra de visayas has enjoyed a resurgence in recent times as a veneer for concrete walls. It is now known commercially as Mactan stone, although this name negates its cultural provenance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The abundance of a hard, black igneous rock in the southern Bicol towns surrounding Mayon Volcano characterized constructions in this area. The blocks of the church in Tabaco in Albay were uniquely chiseled with characters that appear to be either masons&rsquo;s marks or symbols of stone suppliers. Comparable markings may be seen on the Malagonlong Bridge in Tayabas, Quezon Province. In a similar manner, signatures and drawings are inscribed on the bricks of the Church of Santo Domingo in Piat, Cagayan, and on the hardened mortar blocks of the church in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Kuta</strong> Construction.</strong> In places where the art of hewing and cutting stone was unknown, builders raised walls from roughly chipped rocks, shales, or river stones. A pre-Hispanic rubblework wall was recently found enclosing an ancient settlement in Rakwaydi, Mahatao, in the Batanes. The lower portion of the traditional Ivatan house also consisted of the <strong>hurahed</strong>, a low wall cemented with chopped cogon, mud, lime or sand. The rubblework technique is still in use in the formation of rice terraces both in the Cordillera and the southern Tagalog highlands of Majayjay and Tayabas. The Cordillera rice terraces (<strong>payo</strong> among the Ifugao, <strong>payew</strong> among the Ibaloy) utilize rough-hewn stones kept together by clay. Both Ibaloy and Ifugao refer to stone walls of constructions like their rice terraces as <strong>toping</strong> or curiously, like their neighbors the Ilocanos, <strong>kabiti</strong> or <strong>kabite</strong>; its cognate, <strong>kinabiti</strong>, means &ldquo;built of stone.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of construction, known today as rubblework or riprap, was referred to in Spanish surveys as <strong>de mamposteria</strong>. An indigenous term that could replace the Spanish mamposteria for rubblework construction is <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\"><strong>kuta</strong></a></strong>. Although kuta is presently understood as a fort, its hispanicized form, <strong>cota,</strong> appeared in Spanish chronicles and early dictionaries of Philippine languages in a more generic way: as a wall of rough stone bound together by mortar. One who built a cota was called a <strong>cotero</strong>. A kuta wall could be built of riprap stonework: piling and hammering chipped stones into place. It could also be raised by pouring layer after layer (<strong>lechada</strong>) of gravel mixed in mortar in a &ldquo;wall&rdquo; formed by sawali screens of split and woven bamboo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This second type of construction was referred to as <strong>de piedra bituca</strong>, literally &ldquo;of intestinal stone.&rdquo; Since <strong>bituca</strong> meant intestines in many Philippine languages, piedra bituca referred to the mixture of stone and gravel poured into walls as filling. This gravel mixture was known in Spanish as <strong>cascajo</strong>. Pouring the lechada into the empty spaces was done through the aid of <strong>bancas</strong>, much like the constructions at Morong, Rizal. The discerning eye can spot the mat-like impressions of woven bamboo wallings on such places as the underside of a bridge in Badoc, Ilocos Norte; the convent vault in Tumauini, Isabela; the interior of a bulwark in Bulusan, Sorsogon; or the fort in Santa Fe, Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of extant early churches of kuta or rubblework construction. Many of them are in ruins and in out-of-the-way locations, which is why they are little known to the public. Among the oldest is the church in Malaueg in what is now Rizal, Cagayan, from the 1650s. Others are in Pindangan in San Fernando, La Union; Fotol, now known as Pudtol, Apayao; Pata, in what is now Namuac, Sanchez Mira, Cagayan; Maragondon in Cavite, and Santa Cruz in Marinduque. A great number of churches, cemeteries, small constructions and forts in the Visayas and Mindanao were described as de cota or de piedra bituca right up to the end of the 19th century. Although this might imply that certain towns could not afford good stone-cutting masons, many were in fact intended as &ldquo;works in progress&rdquo; and were eventually sheathed with cut stone slabs as funds became available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ladrillo Construction.</strong> The art of brickmaking was introduced at the same time as building in stone. Whereas brick is said to have been imported from Mexico during the first two decades of Spanish rule, Bp de Salazar could boast to the King of Spain, in a letter of 1595, that the Chinese supplied locally fired bricks that made imports unnecessary. These brick products included: <strong>ladrillos</strong> (bricks; <strong>lariyos</strong> in Pangasinan) used for walls, <strong>baldosas</strong> (floor tiles), and <strong>tejas</strong> (roof tiles; also the root word for <strong>tisa</strong>, chalk). The tejas were V-shaped in the Chinese manner, contrasting with the curved roof tiles of Spain and the Americas. They were of two types: <strong>canales</strong> which were laid down with the open side of the &lsquo;V&rsquo; open towards the sky, and <strong>tapaderas</strong> which were placed inverted over the ridges formed by the canales. Rows of upturned tejas also doubled as drain spouts. Halves of roof tiles came in handy as <strong>calang</strong> (wedges) or space fillers in masonry walls, and were even used to line the bottom of salt-beds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different regions evolved their own brick recipes. For example, for the church of Janiuay in Iloilo, three types of soil were combined together: thick and clay-like <strong>balud</strong> from flood plains, fine and sandy <strong>hines</strong> from rice fields, and muddy <strong>anono-o</strong> from creeks. After being monotonously stomped by two carabaos, the mixture was formed into bricks by wooden moulds or <strong>alambre</strong> (wire) slicers, dried on mats, and fired-in kilns. Some of these kilns or <strong>hornos</strong> reached the size of watchtowers; the most impressive are those in Cagayan, especially the complex built by Fr Antonio Lobato, OP in Tuguegarao in the 1760s. Ladrillo architecture reached as far as Jolo, Sulu, exemplified by the church built there by the Jesuits in the late 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bricks with raised decorations of flowers, fruit, and angel heads characterize many late 18th century churches built by the Dominicans in the Cagayan Valley. The most outstanding examples, such as the Tumauini Church in Isabela, were inscribed with numbers and initials to guide their assembly. In other areas such as in Iloilo and Negros, pilasters and rows of bricks were juxtaposed with coralstone for aesthetic effects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Argamasa and Palitada.</strong> Stones and bricks were bound together by mortar, a mixture of lime, sand, and water, which was known as <strong>argamasa</strong>, <strong>hormigon</strong>, or <strong>mezcla</strong>. Pre-Hispanic Filipinos themselves were not strangers to lime (<strong>apog</strong> in many Philippine languages, but <strong>amed</strong> in Ivatan). They procured it from crushed oyster shells and chewed it as <strong>nganga</strong> among the Tagalogs or <strong>mama</strong> among the Visayans. Lime could be combined with coconut ashes to make a kind of soap, boiled with <strong>tuba</strong> wine to obtain honey, or mixed with <strong>tayumtayum</strong> leaves to produce a beautiful blue dye. During the Spanish era, lime for construction was obtained from limestone quarries or from coral rocks and seashells, which were ground and fired in an excavated pit or <strong>calero</strong> (<strong>chiman</strong> in the Batanes). The resulting quicklime was then slaked or kept moist in beds as a putty whose adhesive properties were best after three months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best sand (<strong>arena</strong>, <strong>balas</strong>, or <strong>buhangin</strong> ) was obtained from riverbeds, because it had to be as free from moisture-retaining salt as possible. If obtained from the seashore, sand and other materials had to be washed continuously for up to a year as in Atimonan, Quezon, or two rainy seasons. Two parts of sand were mixed with one part of lime if this was obtained from the seashore; three parts of sand were needed if the lime was quarried from the mountain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make the mixture more durable or binding, ingredients such as molasses, plant sap, and even eggs, were added. Such information, originally obtained from oral tradition, has also been sustained by historical and archival sources. To seal the dome of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> in 1780, a lime mixture with <strong>miel de ca&ntilde;a</strong> or molasses, duck eggs, and powdered brick, was used. Molasses was also used in the repair of the streets of Manila in the 1790s and in the church complex of Baclayon in Bohol in 1844. Mashed leaves of the <strong>puso-puso</strong> tree rendered the mortar water-resistant for the bathroom of the convento in Indang, Cavite in 1862. The same leaves were used in Majayjay, Laguna and in Sarrat, Ilocos Norte where it was called <strong>sablot</strong>. Sap from the <strong>law-at</strong> tree was used in the churches of the Parian district of Cebu and of Loay in Bohol, while <strong>hinaramay</strong> sap was used in Leon, Iloilo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fr Mariano Gomez ordered duck eggs for his church in Bacoor, Cavite in 1824; a little later, 200 duck eggs went into the mortar for the construction in Imus, Cavite. The &ldquo;egg white recipe&rdquo; in construction may explain the popularity of egg-yolk pastries such as <strong>pan de San Nicolas</strong>, <strong>yema</strong>, <strong>tocino</strong><strong>del cielo</strong>, and <strong>leche flan</strong>. Excess egg whites went to the baking of ladyfingers. The architectural value of eggs is ancient, as attested by its use in the 7th century CE monuments at Mamallapuram on the southeastern coast India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Masonry walls had to be protected from erosion brought about by humidity and strong rains, and from decomposition from the roots of plants whose seeds were carried by wind or bird droppings. This protection was effected by a covering of stucco or plaster, a mixture of lime, <strong>yeso</strong> (gesso or gypsum), and <strong>cola</strong> (glue, often obtained from hides of animals such as the carabao). Sometimes the coating was augmented with <strong>malagquit</strong>, a glutinous rice. The plaster was applied with a trowel or <strong>paleta</strong>, which is why the process is appropriately called <strong>palitada</strong>; finer layers were brushed on with <strong>brochas</strong>. Masons erected <strong>palapala</strong> or bamboo scaffolding that was anchored into holes cut into the walls. Such holes may still be seen on the <strong>convento</strong> of Sarrat (Ilocos Norte), an indication that its coating of palitada was left incomplete as a consequence of the Philippine Revolution. The thickness of the palitada ranged from a light whitewash (<strong>blanqueo</strong> or <strong>blanqueadura</strong>) to several layers of lime plaster, the finest and final one on the surface. This covering was also useful in hiding imperfections on the wall, such as unsightly rough stones or gaps filled in by brick shards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stucco also provided a medium for decorative carving or painting on facade entrances, and interiors. The palitada by itself brightened up interiors, as it also improved the acoustics. White was not the only finish, as many other colors were used for the walls. Tints were obtained from organic materials, such as a popular yellow ochre or rust red from material known in Spanish as <strong>almagre</strong> but locally as <strong>barha</strong>, or a shade of blue from the <strong>a&ntilde;il</strong> or indigo plant. It is also listed down as <strong>maon</strong>, the color of denim. Other colors were imported in powder form and mixed with <strong>aceite de linaza</strong> (linseed oil). These were firmed up with carabao glue or even, in the case of San Pedro Tunasan in 1862, cow&rsquo;s blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When paint was not available, the townspeople came up with ingenious devices to color up the surfaces of stone walls. In Malinao, round pebbles lined the cornices of the church. Giant clams or <strong>taclobo</strong> flanked openings in the church of Cagayancillo. Golden cowries, clams, snail shells, and corals were embedded like mosaics in the niche frames, pilasters, and cornices of the church in Guiuan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arquitectura Mestiza and Tabique Pampango.</strong> The twin dangers of fire and earthquake eventually led to the hybridization of local and hispanic architecture which was known as <strong>arquitectura mestiza</strong> in the 17th century. Although masonry walls presented a typical colonial construction, hidden from view was the native wooden framework with its timber posts that held up the roof and upper stories. An excellent example of this fusion is the church of Tubigon in Bohol. Although its facade and side walls are of cut stone, the apse at the back tells a different story. Here the kuta construction was left unfinished; the lack of stone slabs reveals the piedra bituca, which only partially encloses the stout timber pillars that rise above the incomplete wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A forgotten but nevertheless iconic development of arquitectura mestiza was the <strong>tabique pampango</strong>, a wall of light wooden materials covered with lime. The name for this local variant of wattle-and-daub construction was derived from the Spanish <strong>tabique</strong>, or a thin wall, and the still-unexplained descriptive <strong>pampango</strong>, perhaps because the earliest examples may have been noted in Pampanga. The wall was also called <strong>baras-baras</strong>, from the Cebuano word for mangrove, and referred to the use of mangrove wood, which was impervious to moisture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest known evidence of this construction method was a report on earthquake damage in the Ilocos. The churches of Bangar in La Union, and Candon, Bantay, and Cabugao in Ilocos Sur had walls of molave frames interwoven with bamboo and covered with lime, and set into low bases of stone. Although the document dates from 1709 or 1710, it was noted that most of these structures had been begun more than 10 years earlier. The first known author to mention tabique pampango was the Augustinian Joaquin Martinez de Zu&ntilde;iga who, in 1799, described the provisional church of Santa Rosa, Laguna with walls of split bamboo woven into vertical pieces of timber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The screen material held up by the vertical elements in a tabique depended on what was available in the area. The most common example was a kind of basket-weave of bamboo slats (Visayan <strong>salasa</strong> or <strong>sasa</strong>, or Tagalog <strong>patpat</strong> ), similar but stronger than amacan or sawali. In Zamboanga and Surigao, branches of the mangrove (baras-baras or <strong>talibugsuk</strong>) were used instead of bamboo. Another variation was the use of thin wooden planks instead of woven bamboo. These planks were first scored and serrated to ensure the adhesion of the mortar, and then laid horizontally, as in the convent at Loboc in Bohol and Urdaneta in Pangasinan. In Jabonga, Agusan del Norte and Balingasag, Misamis Oriental the planks were painstakingly swathed in <strong>cabo negro</strong>, a rope from the pith of&nbsp;<em>idioc&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>kaong</em>, more commonly known as palm tree.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tabique, being light, economic, and versatile, was used in many structures, particularly those of a provisional nature or in zones distant from the larger towns. It was popular for exterior walls, especially on higher stories, as on the second floor of the bahay na bato or the <strong>cimborio</strong> or dome of a church. In an 1883 survey, 17 of 33 churches in Bohol had walls of tabique pampango. However, with the passage of time, tabique tended to flake and finally break apart, especially if the framework was improperly aged or treated. The Earthquake Ordinances of 1880 expressly forbade the use of tabique pampango in further construction, and decreed that metal sheets or wooden planks would be utilized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Building Materials.</strong> In place of glass, palm-sized window panes were made from the shell of the <strong>capiz</strong> or <strong>tipay</strong>, the window oyster. These translucent clams allowed light to filter through yet were sturdy enough to withstand storms. They were mounted onto a wooden lattice of different colors: white from the molave, red from the <strong>barayong</strong> or <strong>naga</strong>, or black from ebony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pavements, sidewalks, stairways and streets were paved with heavy slabs of granite brought by junks from southern China, hence they were popularly called <strong>piedra china</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the mid-19th century, improved shipping and the opening of the Suez Canal allowed the importation of modern and prestigious building materials, such as clear or colored glass panes, <strong>azulejos</strong> or glazed tiles, black marble, stamped-metal sheets for ceilings, and cast-iron fixtures and hardware. Because tile roofs broke during earthquakes and posed a hazard to the passersby, clay tejas were replaced by metal sheets (<strong>planchas</strong>) made of <strong>sim</strong> (zinc) or <strong>hierro galvanizado</strong> (galvanized iron). These were imported from places like Australia, bearing such brands as Emu or Three Crowns. After the devastating earthquake of 18 Jul 1880, the Consultative Council for Public Works also issued ordinances that stipulated, among other things, the preference for hydraulic or Portland cement over other materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although influenced by Chinese blue and white, through the Arabs who imitated Chinese porcelain, not all azulejos were blue; a good number were polychromed. These tiles were used as finishing for walls and floors, as in the Nagcarlan Church in Laguna; the Basey Church in Samar, where the tiles used are predominantly yellow; and in the Archdiocesan Seminary of Naga, Camarines Sur, where the tiles are polychromed. Black marble, alternated with white to produce a checkerboard or harlequin pattern, was used to replace the wooden floors of many churches and other public buildings. The Machuca Company in Manila produced a cement version of these tiles, which used marble dust and were very popular during the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Master Builders, Engineers, Architects.</strong> In the absence of professional architects, public construction was initiated by both civil and religious authority from the 16th to the 18th centuries, and relied on the ingenuity and training of the priest or the local official. Although the Spanish crown sent military engineers to supervise construction throughout the colonial period, it was in 1805 that the corps of government engineers was organized and only in 1867 that the Obras Publicas was established. By the late 19th century, there was a sufficient number of professionally trained builders and architects to take charge of construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early builders may have relied on classic manuals, such as the 1st century BC&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ten Books on Architecture</em></strong> by the Roman architect Vitruvius. Sebastiano Serlio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Seven Books of Architecture</em></strong> published in 1537, found its way to the University of Santo Tomas&rsquo;s rare book collection, suggesting that the work was known, if not consulted by friar builders. The practical knowledge gained by friars and priests may have been codified. The Augustinian Juan de Albarran, builder of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o Shrine in Cebu in 1735, wrote down his experience of building as a guide for future friar-builders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Misrepresented in 19th- and 20th-century bibliographies as a full-blown architectural handbook is <strong><em>Modo de Construir Iglesias y Conventos en las Islas Filipinas</em></strong> (Ways of Constructing Churches and Conventos in the Philippine Islands), the manuscript written in 1739 which is part of a general report on the Santo Ni&ntilde;o Shrine. The first four pages of the manuscript report the friar&rsquo;s practical experience in procuring piedra de visayas and lime for construction. The remaining folios contain a general discussion on architecture based on European handbooks especially those written by Palladio, Juan de Arfe, and Juan de Nicolas. Another 19th century architectural handbook by Manuel Herbella y Perez, <strong><em>Manual de Construcciones y de Fortificacion de Campa&ntilde;a en Filipinas</em></strong> (Manual of Buildings and of Campaign Fortification in the Philippines), published 1882, was primarily a guide for military construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual business of building, both for public and private projects, was handled by the <strong>maestros de obras</strong> (master builders) who imbibed their skills from friars, military engineers, and other learned persons, and from practical experience. Pedro Jusepe, master builder of the walls of Intramuros in 1591, was probably a Filipino. Filipinos were most probably already at the helm of construction projects within two decades after the founding of Manila. Another master carpenter-contractor was Jeronimo Tongco, who also worked on the walls of Intramuros. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2689\">Bartolome Palatino</a> was another master builder from the 19th century who built the facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">Morong Church</a> from 1850 to 1853. Severo Sacramento was commissioned to renovate the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/388\">Tayabas Church</a> from 1855 to 1860. The government sought to professionalize the work of the maestros by opening schools of arts and trades in Pampanga, Iloilo, and Manila. In 1890, the Manila school graduated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a>, its most outstanding maestro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction workers were paid a daily wage, but an equally common practice was to contract the work or the procurement of material to the maestro or to some person. The contractual system, called<em>pakyaw</em>, which survives to the present, seems to have been favored by the Chinese. The government also employed a system of<em>polo y servicio</em>, which meant that able-bodied males were compelled to render labor for public construction for a period of 60 days per year. Exceptions were allowed for the sickly, the<em>principalia</em>(elite), and those in military service. This system of conscripted labor was used for infrastructure, like the building of roads, bridges, forts, and harbors. During the 17th century, most conscripted labor in Luzon went toward the construction of galleons&mdash;from felling timber, to hewing, to hauling it to the ports where the ships were made. Parish priests sometimes requested authorization from the government to use conscripted labor for the construction and repair of ecclesiastical buildings; such authorization, however, was at times grudgingly given. Not all labor was human, it must be noted. The construction of the Jesuit church in the early 1620s was aided by an elephant from Cambodia, a gift from the governor-general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>The American Colonial Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The United States gained control of the Philippines in 1898, and in 1901, the Philippine Commission, the ruling body of the Philippines, created the Bureau of Architecture and Control of Public Buildings. Edgar Bourne was appointed as the first consulting architect of the Bureau. He designed the Government Laboratory, between Padre Faura and Pedro Gil, in the Mission Revival style. Although the Bureau was subsequently abolished on 1 Nov 1905 and relegated to the level of a division, these acts of the colonial government placed the supervision and control of the construction and repair of public buildings squarely in government hands. In 1904, the American Commissioner William Cameron Forbes asked <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel Burnham</a> to come to the Philippines to make recommendations for the amelioration of Manila and Baguio. Burnham asked for William E. Parsons to serve as consulting architect for the Philippines, a post Parsons occupied from 1905 to 1914. In 1914, he was joined by George Fenhagen, and in 1916, by Ralph Harrington Doane who served until 1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the Jones Law, a Division of Architecture was created in which American and Filipino architects were employed. Carlos A. Barreto, Antonio Toledo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a> worked with Parsons, Fenhagen, and Doane. Parsons favored the use of reinforced concrete against natural stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Concrete is produced by mixing cement, sand, gravel or aggregate&mdash;pebbles or crushed stones&mdash;and water, and pouring this mixture into forms where it dries and hardens, becoming stone-like. The strength of concrete depends on the ratio of cement to sand and stone and the amount of water used. The ancient Romans used concrete made of broken bricks or stones and a cement of lime and volcanic ash. It was not exposed but faced with brick or finely cut stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the Romans, modern cement is produced by burning and pulverizing a mixture of clay and limestone. Reinforced concrete or ferroconcrete, is concrete with steel bars laid in accordance with calculations for stress. While concrete has a very heavy resistance to compression, its tensile strength is only one-tenth of its compressive strength. Thus, in a slab or beam supported at both ends, where a load produces compression in the upper section and tension in the lower, steel bars are laid in the lower section to take the tension. In a cantilevered slab or beam, which is supported at one end, the reverse occurs. The upper section is subjected to tensile stress, and the lower to compressive. Thus the position of the steel bars is reversed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reinforced concrete is remarkable for both its durability and its plasticity. It can be shaped into thin shells, which are strengthened by their curvature, such as domes, barrel roofs, saddle roofs, and hypar or hyperbolic paraboloid roofs and umbrella-like shapes. It is also used in folded plate construction. Long thin slabs are joined at their long edges to form what look like pleats or accordion folds, thereby reinforcing each other to produce rigidity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While concrete was invented by the Romans, reinforced concrete was invented by the French. After the decline of the Roman Empire, concrete fell into disuse. It was revived in France in the 18th century. The use of metal reinforcements came later. In the 1830s concrete floors were constructed with an iron network. In the late 1870s concrete columns and beams were reinforced with iron bars. Calculations for the design of concrete structures developed in the 1870s in Germany and the US. Towards the end of the century factories with concrete framework were constructed. The development of steel as a building material led to further advances, such as prestressing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reinforced concrete was introduced in the Philippines during the early American colonial period. The first beneficiaries of this type of construction were the public elementary buildings, for which the amount of one million pesos was allocated by the Gabaldon Act of 1907. Reinforced concrete also lends itself to prefabrication. Building components, such as wall sections, floor slabs, columns, and beams, can be produced in a factory, then transported and assembled at the building site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of <strong>hollow cement blocks</strong> was also introduced during the American era. Machine or hand-operated molds were popular. Initially, cement was imported from Japan and China until the first cement plant was opened in Binangonan, Rizal. This town was a traditional source of limestone since the Spanish era. As more quarries of limestone and cement factories were built, the dependence on imported cement diminished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following Burnham&rsquo;s dictum that the Spanish colonial architecture should be the basis of a new style of architecture for the Philippines, Parsons made use or arches, plain walls, and capiz windows in such buildings as the Philippine General Hospital and the Army-Navy Club. Cement, the construction material favored by the American colonial government, was used not only for walls and structural members but also for precast ornaments and fixtures, like classical capitals, friezes, and reliefs for pediments. Government builders favored the neoclassical style, while in the 1930s art deco, which favored ornamentation and precast-cement moldings and relief, became popular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glass blocks, stained glass, and Bakelite were materials frequently used in art deco and art nouveau designs. Glass blocks allowed light to enter and were used on both exterior and interior walls. Stained glass, used previously in churches, found its way into domestic architecture. Bakelite, a precursor of plastic, was used for doorknobs, pulls, and appliances. Wrought iron, already popular since the Spanish colonial era, found new expressions in art deco geometric and stylized floral motifs. Construction steel was imported from the US, and used to build the bridges built to span rivers and chasms</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gabaldon schoolhouse was perhaps the most disseminated building type because it was built in every city and municipality, and even in the city districts and the municipality&rsquo;s barrios. The design was used for many schools for both the primary and tertiary levels. As designed by Parsons, the schoolhouse adapted many features of vernacular architecture. It was raised from the ground to protect it from dampness and cold. It was anchored by concrete foundations on which wood or reinforced concrete posts supported a lintel and post construction. Its roof was pitched like the bahay kubo and the bahay na bato. It used hardwood for floors and partitions and had a transom for light and ventilation. Its windows were awning type like the bahay kubo and used capiz panes for the window shutters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Post-World War II Traditions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The postwar period ushered in massive rebuilding. While reinforced concrete, steel framing for bridges, and other materials of the American era continued to be used, new materials and building techniques were introduced. Steel frame construction and reinforced concrete allowed the construction of higher buildings. Other technological advances, such as prefabrication and prestressed concrete, allowed the rapid construction of buildings and the multiplication of housing units to meet the need of a growing population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prefabrication refers to the manufacture of buildings or their components before they are assembled or installed at the construction site. Prefabrication of building parts originated in England in the late 18th century, when cast iron began to be used in the construction of bridges and factories. It was further developed in the United States in the 19th century when metal items, such as structural members, window frames, and facade panels, were mass-produced. In the 20th century, aluminum curtain walls were manufactured for high-rise buildings. With the development of precast concrete, wall panels and floor slabs began to be prefabricated. The invention of prestressing has led to the prefabrication of concrete girders and beams for bridges, elevated highways, and buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prefabrication was more intensively developed in the mid-20th century with the increasing shortage of skilled labor, the rise in the volume of construction, and the more extensive use of modular design based on standard measurements. Prefabrication has been especially suitable for low-cost housing and school buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The oldest and most famous example of prefabricated construction in the Philippines is the all-steel San Sebastian Basilica, all parts of which were manufactured in Belgium, shipped to Manila, and assembled at the site. Mass housing in Vitas, Tondo, Manila consists of prefabricated units, which are shaped like boxes and stacked to a height of four stories in staggered arrangement, so that additional units are created in the intervening space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prestressed concrete marks a further development in concrete construction. Prestressing means subjecting a reinforced-concrete beam to stress before it takes on the load for which it was designed. Prestressing has made it possible to reduce the depth of concrete beams and to increase their span.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A reinforced-concrete beam can be designed to span any length. However, the longer the span, the deeper the beam should be. Prestressing reduces the size of a concrete beam by increasing its strength through induced stresses that result in greater resistance to the load.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In pre-tensioning, the tendons or cables that reinforce the beam are pulled and held in tension before the concrete is poured and until it has hardened. The tendons are then released and their tension compresses the concrete, increasing its strength. In post-tensioning, the tendons are enclosed in a sleeve or tube set in the concrete so that they do not directly touch it. When the concrete has hardened, the tendons are pulled against it, thereby compressing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In post-tensioning, the stress on the tendons can be adjusted to suit the load. The principle of prestressing can be illustrated by tightly pressing together a row of books at both ends and lifting them up. The books are held together by compression and can support the weight of an object placed on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of prestressed concrete beams has enabled architects to design large clear spaces, such as lobbies, halls, and supermarkets with the fewest possible supports, or without any intervening supports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Contemporary Materials.</strong> The building boom that began in urban centers during the late 1980s has introduced new construction materials. Many large hardware firms usually specialize in one product alone, i.e. tiles. The materials mostly come from China but there are also materials from Europe, other parts of Southeast Asia and the Philippines. Some are building materials like ficem, fiber and cement boards, gypsum boards for dry walling, dense styrofoam for insulation, powder-coated long-span roofing, shingles, and prefabricated aluminum windows. Glass glazing has increased in dimensions and is favored by high-rise buildings. Improvement in tempering glass has made it a durable external material. For finishes, polished granite from China in various colors, glass blocks, and ceramic tiles of various colors and textures, even imitating the texture of stone, wood, and metal, are used. Composite materials have also been introduced for internal wall and flooring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For outdoors, architects are now favoring prefabricated cladding in cement, painted aluminum and hard vinyl. As for appliances like sinks and bathrooms, prefabricated shower rooms, bathroom fixtures and plastic doors have been introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bamboo has also enjoyed a resurgence. It is a fine natural material that meets all the criteria as a sustainable building construction material. With the drastic loss of Philippine forests in the past 40 years, there is need to source alternative materials, besides precious hardwoods, to build homes. With population growth, there is also a call for alternative shelters. Bamboo has emerged as an ideal candidate because it is quick-growing and versatile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bamboo has a tensile strength equal to that of steel, and a compressive strength comparable to concrete: 10,000 lbs per square inch. When harvested at the right stage of its growth, it can be used creatively to maximize its potential, even structurally. When the poles are harvested when they are between three and six years old, cleaned of thorns and protective sheets and treated with a diluted borax solution, they can last for a long time. Stored above the ground, away from ultraviolet rays of the sun, bamboo will keep. he decorative features of bamboo have also been appreciated when used as veneers for walls, floors, furniture and other decorative items. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

		"text": "<p><strong>Design in architecture</strong> refers to the planning, whether by professional architects or folk builders, of any structure before it is built or as it is being built. It is the creative process that aims to produce a structure, private or public, that fulfills the needs of its future occupants or users. It considers the environment, culture, and traditions of these occupants; the climate, location, and other environmental factors; construction methods and equipment, available materials, funds, workers, basic services, and other circumstances or conditions&mdash;religious, social, political, economic&mdash;that have or will have an effect on the structure that is being planned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an art, architecture has elements of both painting and sculpture. In designing the facade and other elevations of a building, the architect approaches his task like a painter, working in two dimensions, as he composes an arrangement of lines and planes and considers light, shadow, and color. Taking the three-dimensional approach of a sculptor, the architect envisions the building as a volume or an assemblage of volumes&mdash;cubes, oblong blocks, pyramids, cylinders, or hemispheres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What makes architecture distinct from painting and sculpture is the design and ordering of space for the purpose of satisfying human needs, whether it is the bodily need for shelter or the psychological need for an aesthetic or spiritual experience. A building is primarily a space defined and organized by structure. As a work of art, a building is designed not only to possess beauty but also to express meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As a science, architecture is concerned with the usefulness and durability of a building. The planning of interior spaces, including their forms, dimensions, interrelations, and their relation with the environment, has to do with the function or purpose of a building. Since a building is primarily a shelter meant to provide protection from the elements, its design takes into account the climate features of the location: the heat of the sun, the volume of rain, and the direction of the wind. In a tropical setting, a building is expected to keep out heat and rain, and let in air for ventilation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designing a building for durability requires knowledge of materials and structural systems. The design of space is inseparable from the design of the structure, which in simpler forms would consist of foundations; vertical supports, such as columns and piers; and horizontal supports, such as beams and girders, walls, floors, and the roof. More sophisticated structures could employ arches, vaults, domes, buttresses, space frames, or cantilevers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architecture is not only the work of an individual designer but also the product of a culture, and as such it reflects the values and the spirit of its time. The major architectural works of a historical period signify its dominant mood: whether this be the longing for an experience of the divine, the glorification of secular power, the affirmation of human dignity, the desire for efficiency, or the exaltation of commerce and technology. Since works of architecture are commissioned by patrons or clients, they also represent the interests of the dominant class, whether these be political, economic, or cultural. Of all the arts, architecture is the most visible and the most ubiquitous, since it comprises the human-made part of the environment, and serves the universal need for shelter. It is the art that is most closely bound with one&rsquo;s daily life, for to live is to be in shelter.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Design Process.</strong> The process of architectural design begins with defining the purpose and requirements of a building as envisioned by the owner or client. The architect then studies the proposed site of the building, its size, shape, orientation, location, topography, and the immediate as well as larger environment. Research prior to actual design would include study of the intended use of the building, the various activities, and the movement of people and things within and outside. In the case of houses, the lifestyle of the residents would be the object of study. Aside from organizing space for maximum efficiency, the designer also considers cultural requirements, as well as the expressive or symbolic function of the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The preliminary phase of design includes diagrams and sketches in which concepts are translated into basic forms or schemes. The first products of design are the floor plan and the site plan&mdash;the design of the interior space and its relation to the site and the environment&mdash;seen in terms of the two dimensions of length and width.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the floor plan as basis, the architect proceeds to designing the space with its third dimension of height. The drawings of all sides of the exterior of a building are called elevations. To show the interior space of the building, the architect draws longitudinal and cross sections, imagining a line or invisible plain cutting through the building at certain points. More realistic views of the building are presented in the perspectives, both exterior and interior, which may be rendered in color. Plans and elevations form the preliminary drawings which are presented to the client for approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artistic conception of the building is followed or accompanied by the structural design, or the engineering aspect of architecture. Taking into account the load that the spaces will carry, the length, width, and height of the spaces, the bearing strength of the soil, wind pressure, the force of earthquakes, and the strength of construction materials, the structural engineer designs the foundations, columns, beams, walls, and floors of the building. The design of electrical, plumbing, air-conditioning, mechanical, and fire-control systems is assigned to specialists. Others specialists such as interior designers and landscape architects, may be engaged by the architect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the client approves the preliminary drawings, the architect prepares the working drawings in specifications. The working drawings show all the details of construction, and the specifications lay down instructions to supplement the plans and specify the quality or brands of materials or items to be used or installed. The drawings and specifications are given to building contractors who prepare estimates and submit bids. Upon the award of the contract, construction begins. The drawings and specifications are essential elements of the contract made between the owner and the builder or contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the advent of the computer, the term &ldquo;design&rdquo; has not been limited to architecture but now includes a variety of activities and products and many disciplines. Advanced computer-aided design (CAD) software has made it convenient for architects and designers to make a preliminary design and modify it, represent it in varying light and weather conditions, change the color, texture, and details of an architectural plan. CAD can represent material like wood, natural stone, cement, or ceramic in a way that gives the owner and the builder an idea what the finished work will be. With CAD, it is also possible to integrate interior design so that furnishings such as light fixtures, furniture, carpets, and curtains can be seen in a computer rendered design. CAD can also make perspective and 3D drawings so that a building can be visually experienced. More and more architects are creating walkthroughs and flyovers so that a client or a future user can have an idea what the building will be like. Digital technology has allowed for a virtual experience of a structure long before it is built. Architectural design is evolving toward not just seeing a plan before it is executed, but having a computer-aided experience of the plan. Design is increasingly about virtual experience, so that architectural design and related fields, like landscape, interior, furniture, and product design are coalescing to become experience-design. With the invention of 3D printing it is possible to have models that are partially or fully computerized, so that a level of precision not possible with handcrafted models can be achieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the design and the list of materials are agreed upon, contractors and subcontractors and the team of experts are chosen and the budget fixed. Contractors then assemble their teams of workers, take care of getting the building permits, and set up the working conditions on the site. The architect, as representative of the owner or client, supervises or inspects the construction, seeing to it that plans and specifications are faithfully followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Evolution of Design.</strong> In the Philippines, the design of indigenous houses resulted from a long evolution that began with rudimentary shelter, such as the lean-to or windscreen made from twigs and leaves. The house-form developed as the occupants devised better ways of protecting themselves from the elements&mdash;from rain, strong winds, the heat of the sun, the dampness of the ground, and from insects, animals, and enemies. Interaction with the environment led to the discovery of better forms of shelter, more durable building materials, and better methods of construction. As the primitive economy improved, so did the way of life develop through increasing needs and expectations and the growing capacity to satisfy them. Shelters became larger if there was need for more space, became more sturdily constructed, and better adapted to the climate and environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous house forms in their development became standardized, almost rigidly so, for a particular community. Thus, houses are identical, and serve as the identification of a community. The Ifugao house, for example, while following a basic form, has distinctive local variants in Lagaue, Banaue, and Mayoyao, and each variant is the norm for that community. Several communities in a region could employ the same particular feature but subject to local variations. For example, Ifugao, Bontok, Kankanaey, and Sagada houses use the four-post, two-girder, three-joist frame, yet each community has a distinctive house form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>bahay kubo</strong> (nipa hut) is built on a basic principle (i.e., a living space raised on stilts and covered by a hip or gable roof). Its form, like that of the indigenous house, has been dictated by needs and functions. But, unlike the indigenous house, the bahay kubo avails of some freedom of design. Floor plans, dimensions, materials, and features may vary. Sidings could be of split bamboo, flattened bamboo, woven bamboo strips, or thatch. Shutters may swing out or slide to the sides. There may be a covered porch or an open platform, or the roof may extend over an area on ground level. The design of the house is determined by the preferences of the owner. The bahay kubo is vernacular architecture characterized by some measure of individuality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architectural design during the Spanish colonial period may be classified into two types: the design produced by architects, engineers, or friars, closely following European models; and the design that resulted from the interaction of indigenous forms and Western architectural styles. The first includes churches, government buildings, and fortifications that were built in accordance with professionally prepared plans and under close supervision by the Spanish friars, architects, and engineers. The churches and civic buildings in Intramuros and the forts built in various parts of the country are the best examples of this type. The second type includes houses in Intramuros built during the Spanish colonial period, which combined local wooden construction with stone walls in the European style, the bahay kubo built in other sections of Manila and in the provincial towns, and the churches built in the missions and parishes outside Manila. The design of houses were probably the work of <strong>maestros de obras</strong> (master builders) and head masons, who were not only skilled workers but also artists to some extent. Their talents were employed not only in the design of architectural ornaments, such as wooden tracery and stone carvings, but also in the design of spaces and functional features, such as the <strong>caida</strong> (receiving hall), the <strong>sala</strong> (living room), the <strong>volada</strong> (gallery), and the <strong>escalera</strong> (staircase). Houses were designed with due regard for the preferences of the owner, who very likely decided how large the house and its rooms should be, what materials should be used, and how the structure should be decorated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architectural design during the Spanish colonial period reflects the major concerns of Spain in the Philippines, namely, the establishment and propagation of the Catholic religion; the strengthening of colonial rule; the defense of the regime from enemies, whether from within or from without; the extension of social services to the population; and the development of the economy. The most impressive landmarks left by the Spanish rule are the churches and fortresses and the few remaining government buildings. However, the Spaniards also built schools, hospitals, factories, commercial buildings, and a railway system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provincial churches and the <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (stone house) stand as memorials to the encounter and synthesis of native and Spanish culture. They signify the native response to the introduction of Western culture, a response characterized by hospitable acceptance. Philippine architectural design in this period developed through the interactions between native and immigrant designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The profession of architecture gained prominence in the 19th century as architects, mostly Spaniards, were engaged for the design of a wide variety of structures, including the sumptuous homes of the affluent. It must be noted, however, that architectural plans from the 19th century include designs for middle-class residences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since there were no architectural schools in the country during the Spanish regime, Filipinos like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>&nbsp;had to go abroad to study architecture. A gifted Filipino who was inclined to architecture but could not afford to study abroad could become at most a maestro de obras, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a>. Although lacking formal architectural training, Arellano succeeded in designing buildings in the Gothic revival, neo-Renaissance, neobaroque, and art nouveau styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American colonial period witnessed the emergence of the Filipino architect, who in the early decades was invariably trained abroad. The first major buildings of that era were, however, the work of an American architect, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William E. Parsons</a>, who had been chosen by Daniel H. Burnham to implement his development plans for Manila and Baguio. The buildings of the early years of America in the Philippines reflected the thrusts of her colonial policy: public education, public health, training in self-government, and economic development. The Philippine General Hospital, the Philippine Normal School, the University of the Philippines (UP), and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> were all products of this policy. Roads and bridges were built to link the various parts of the country, while schools and provincial capitols were constructed at an impressive pace beyond the pueblo complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his early buildings, Parsons aimed to create a new architectural style that evoked the Spanish colonial buildings in Manila yet at the same time employed modern methods of construction. Reinforced concrete was used extensively and its smooth, plain surfaces characterized the new style. The modernism of Parsons did not last very long, for he shifted to neoclassicism before he ended his employment in the Philippines. However, he bequeathed this style to the American and Filipino architects who succeeded him at the Bureau of Public Works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architectural design in the Philippines in the 20th century consisted of the reproduction of historical or revivalist styles, the adaptation of modern styles, such as art deco and the International style, and the effort to create a distinct Filipino style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in the Spanish colonial period, the development of architectural design was influenced by foreign styles. However, there has been a growing appreciation of indigenous architecture as a source for a contemporary Filipino style. This is exemplified by the Tahanang Pilipino, designed by Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa, which is a building notable for its evocation of folk architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although design by imitation is evident in some buildings, there is just as visible an attempt to be original and truly creative. A building like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Church of the Holy Sacrifice</a> at the UP represents a breakthrough in design. Departing from conventional forms, the airy circular church shows the way to the development of architecture that is modern and tropical. At the same time it serves as a symbol of what the church should be&mdash;accessible to all and always welcoming. The building is open all around; there are no doors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of architecture as sculpture has produced buildings of great visual impact. One such building is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> Main Building, designed by Locsin, which impresses the viewer as a giant piece of geometric sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important element of contemporary architectural design is technology, which includes structural design and the various convenience systems, like air-conditioning, fire control, security, elevators and escalators, and electrical and plumbing systems. A building is no longer simply space and structure, but a complex of machines and systems that have to be integrated into an object of aesthetic delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the indigenous tradition through the Spanish colonial period and the American colonial period to the present, Philippine architectural design has developed from the simple response to the environment and social needs, through the encounter and reconciliation with a foreign culture, to the task of synthesizing the country&rsquo;s cultural heritage, the architect&rsquo;s originality, and the blessings of modern technology. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p><strong>Heritage conservation</strong> is the maintenance and preventive care for buildings, other architectural structures, and open sites to prolong their existence and their usefulness. Architecturally, heritage refers to built structures and open spaces or sites of antiquity that are significant to a culture because of historical, social, cultural, artistic, or economic reasons, which warrant their conservation. The time measure for antiquity varies from place to place. Legislation on this matter is not uniform. Common time measures are 50, 75, or 100 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These structures and sites are called heritage or patrimony because they are considered as being valuable and worthy of being passed on to succeeding generations as gifts from the past (heritage) or inheritance from their ancestors (patrimony). Architecture is classified as tangible heritage, because there is a physical object or a place that remains over time. Tangible heritage is contrasted to intangible heritage which leaves no physical remains but disappears after a period of time. The term is usually applied to performances of music, dance, and theater or transitory things like events and festivities or even to cuisine, which is consumed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) focusing on heritage conservation have certain systems for identifying and recognizing heritage structures and sites, marking them, and protecting them for the future. Heritage conservation laws have been passed in many countries and an international effort at conservation is overseen by UNESCO, established in 1945, especially through the <strong><em>Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage</em></strong>, adopted by the UNESCO General Conference on 16 Nov 1972. This convention gave rise to the inscription of structures, sites, and cultural routes on the World Heritage List</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The field of heritage conservation uses a number of specific terms that are often confused. <strong>Consolidation</strong> refers to major maintenance work that addresses threats to a structure or site. For instance, a wall that may have cracked after an earthquake has to be made whole again or consolidated, by repairing, or even strengthening the structure. <strong>Restoration</strong> means returning a structure or site to its earliest or most historic stage. Later additions or accretions, as well as ornaments and layers of paint, may be removed. A decision may have to be made about a historical structure or site as to which era it will be restored to. <strong>Reconstruction</strong> means rebuilding a structure following the original plans and building techniques after massive destruction following damages caused by nature, such as floods and earthquake; by accidents, or by humans, as happens during a war. <strong>Renovation</strong> is changing a part or the entirety of a heritage structure or site. Some renovations may be done if the heritage being renovated is not unique or irreplaceable. For instance, if a row of townhouses is deemed historical, the best of the units may be conserved and the rest remodeled. Finally, architectural <strong>reuse</strong> means restoring a heritage structure or site but using it for another purpose that will not destroy the structure or radically alter its historical value. For instance, a school or <strong>municipio</strong> may be converted into a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Heritage Conservation as Global Movement.</strong> The history of heritage conservation shows that conservation is a contested concept and there is no unanimity about this matter. Prior to the 20th century, conservation was not an issue. Renaissance popes, for example, renovated Rome by tearing down the 4th century Basilica of St Peter and replacing it with a Renaissance-baroque structure. When Giancarlo Bernini was commissioned to do the colonnade at the Piazza San Pietro at the Vatican, he had buildings demolished. Napoleon Bonaparte renovated the street plans of Paris by making wide boulevards and avenues that involved demolition of older structures. Napoleon&rsquo;s urban renewal of Paris meant a loss of old buildings and a radical change of the city&rsquo;s layout. Even up to the 20th century, Benito Mussolini built Via della Conciliazione to mark the accord between the Vatican and the Italian state in 1936. In 1950, an Egyptian obelisk was placed at the center of the piazza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, a new consciousness about the past and its heritage emerged. The intellectual root of this movement goes back to the previous century, when a historical sense began pervading Western thought. With the development of critical history, advances in archaeology, paleography, conservation of artifacts, the birth of the social disciplines of ethnography and anthropology, and the theoretical reflections and theories on change and evolution by thinkers like Fredrick Hegel, Charles Darwin, and Russell Wallace, European thought was invaded by a sense of flux.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hegel presented an optimistic picture of progress, from thesis facing antithesis and evolving into a higher synthesis, while Darwin painted an evolutionary picture of the survival of the fittest, the world wars shook the foundations of this idealistic optimism. The Athens Charter of 1931 had already articulated the urgency of preserving and restoring ancient buildings and, after World War II, the 1931 Charter became the starting point for the heritage conservation movement. This was articulated further in national declarations and in the work of international agencies like the International Council of Museums and UNESCO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World War II saw the destruction not just of sites, structures, and artifacts, but the very possibility that an entire group of people could be obliterated. While the Nazi-sponsored Holocaust sent six million Jews to their death, thousands of noncombatants were killed in the battles that ensued around the world, and ended with the catastrophic dawning of the atomic age as the first atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, the response to the possibility that the past could and would be obliterated inspired a spirited response to restore, rebuild, and conserve. The European movement of heritage conservation began by focusing on specific sites and buildings. This was part of the postwar effort at reconstruction. The concern that the past would be completely cut off from the present inspired the rebuilding of historic architecture rather than replacing them with more modern and functional ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s, the heritage conservation movement became widespread in Europe as countries began to rebuild after the devastation of World War II. Although there were previous initiatives to preserve the past, the consciousness that the past was vital to society and to humanity was heightened during the postwar era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That Europe should gravitate toward architectural reconstruction is probably rooted in the European sense of space. The very word &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; is etymologically derived from the Latin<em>cives</em>,<em>civitas</em>, meaning city. &ldquo;City&rdquo; in the classical Roman sense consisted of built structures laid out in space according to plan. The Roman<em>cives</em>was a well-ordered space for a society organized according to Roman law. The first century Roman architect Vitruvius described buildings as having three qualities: utility, monumentality, and permanence. Permanence was structurally expressed in the use of enduring material like stone and brick or cement; monumentality in buildings that made a statement; utility in buildings that served a purpose. The classical tradition, modified by different cultural influences&mdash;Byzantine, Moorish, and the like&mdash;was reinterpreted and reinforced by the classicism of the Renaissance and revivalist architecture that laid the foundation for the European urbanscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first impulse of conservation focuses on buildings that marked, delineated, and defined European space, because these buildings were icons of European civilization. Heritage was equated, especially in the popular mind, with buildings and sites. Not surprising too is the fact that the early listings in the UNESCO World Heritage List are single detached buildings. We note for instance, how many single buildings are listed in Spain, including the popular shrine of Santiago de Compostela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as the heritage conservation movement became global, the movement was challenged by differing but culturally defined sense of heritage. The Venice charter of 1964 defined &ldquo;an historic monument&rdquo; as embracing &ldquo;not only the single architectural work but also the urban and rural setting or an historical event. This applies not only to the great works of art but also to more modest works of the past, which have acquired cultural significance with the passing of time.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the movement spread to Southeast Asia, heritage conservation came face to face with a completely different philosophy of space. Despite the age of many Asian civilizations, many Southeast Asian countries can show little by way of precolonial historic architecture and the corresponding urbanscape. The exceptions would be Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos with their Hindu and Buddhist temples and complexes; Java with Prambanan and Borobudur; and the Kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Sukothai in Thailand. Almost always, surviving historic architecture and urbanscapes are related to religion and royalty. But even the remains of royal palaces are incomplete. Many of the historic remains in Ayutthaya and Ratu Boko in the hills of Gunung Kidul are mere foundations. The wooden superstructure has all but disappeared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What has been classified as vernacular architecture in the West, and traditionally regarded as secondary after the monumental type of architecture, comprises most of Southeast Asian architectural heritage. Stone monuments, such as Prambanan or the chedis of Thailand, are not so much shelters as they are markers&mdash;singular points in the landscape that mark sacred spaces for religious rites. It is postulated that around these sites were villages and dwelling complexes for monks and other religious functionaries, but the evidence is scant or not immediately visible, as in Borobudur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of rural Southeast Asia remains agricultural. And agrarian cultures are closely bound to the cyclic rhythms of nature. Asian vernacular architecture tends to imitate this cycle: for instance, dwellings, mostly timber and thatch, renewed after being damaged by typhoons or earthquake or fire. Bali&rsquo;s Pura Besakih, built on the slopes of Mt Agung, represents a mental quandary for the conservationist. Called the mother temple of the Shaivite Hindu religion, Pura Besakih is not one structure but a cluster of structures dedicated to the Trimurti: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. Around the main temple are clan temples and other smaller temples. At present, a new temple is being built by the silver and goldsmiths&rsquo;s guild. The new temple promises to be more sumptuous than the older ones. Older temples are renewed; their roofs of palm fiber and woodwork changed regularly or when damaged by the elements. Although tour guides claim that Besakih was built in the 11th century, it is suspected to be older.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A study of the pre-1930s Balinese sculptures at the Bali Museum in Denpasar shows the difference between the historical periods. These statues are far removed from earlier pieces: they are simply delineated, and some even display only a few abstract strokes not the richly decorated, graceful carving we associate with Balinese stonework. Much of the decoration and statuary in Besakih belong to the ornate style we may want to call Balinese baroque, which we can trace to the art revival of the 1930s, inspired by the Europeans Walter Spies and Bonnet, working closely with the sultan of Ubud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A move to conserve the Besakih temple, meaning to keep as much of the old stones and statuary in place, was met with opposition by the Balinese themselves. The focus of contention centered on the Balinese sense of architecture. For the Hindu Balinese, the one reality of life is its flux. Balinese rituals are all about passages and changes. The final ritual of life, cremation, is intended to return the human body back to the basic elements: earth, water, and fire. Analogically, architecture also has a life cycle; thus the periodic feasts to honor the gods and the spirits. The gods and the spirits do not dwell permanently in sacred sites, but come down through the throne-like towers where offerings of flowers, pandan, rice, coconut, food, and incense are laid, displayed on dainty plaited palm leaf trays. The temples are not alive in the same way all of the time. They are more &ldquo;alive&rdquo; at great feasts when it is customary to drape sacred figures and structures with checkered sarongs and precious cloths. This living architectural structure, like all things on earth, decay. For the Balinese, the renewal of old things is an important element of religious belief. Thus, structures within temples are updated. The pavilions for preparing offerings are now decked with glazed tiles, when they may have been packed earth in earlier times. The shrines are embellished with statuary, churned in large quantities in Batubulan from soft sandstone, volcanic stone, even molded in cement. All depend on the devotion of the followers who believe that improving temples is a meritorious act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What then does conservation mean for a culture that values flux and change over permanency as European Classicist culture does? The Yogyakarta and Kotagede declaration of 1996, describes heritage as encompassing a wider social phenomenon: &ldquo;urban conservation involves enhancing the quality of life within the framework of the evolving built environment.&rdquo; The focus must no longer be on the built environment apart from people, but the evolving environment, which must serve to enhance a people&rsquo;s lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly as the heritage conservation movement diffuses worldwide, the term itself can no longer hold a univocal meaning. Heritage has become a contested concept. When heritage professionals and advocates throughout Asia describe heritage conservation, they cite a range of things: from monuments and sites, to artifacts, to cultural performances, to habits and customs, to values of tribes, to literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The consequence of this equivocal or sliding definition of heritage means that the practice of heritage conservation is a variety of tasks. These can mean anything from the conservation and preservation of ancient and historic structures to the documentation of cultural performance through electronic media. It can also involve the revitalization and modernization of traditions or their careful transmission through a system of apprenticeship. It can also involve petrifying the tradition in museums and museum-like surroundings, as in the creation of heritage villages and zones. An extreme version of this petrification process is the Disney-fication of heritage conservation with heritage theme parks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like all movements, the heritage conservation has no single center, nor is there always consensus. Although international conservation organizations exist, these bodies serve principally as clearing houses or as facilitators. Part of UNESCO&rsquo;s policy involves waiting for the national or local body to arrive at consensus before offering technical assistance. The inscription on the World Heritage List depends on the work on the local level, including adequate and reliable documentation, the setting up of conservation plans, and organization of local conservancy groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because heritage is a sliding concept, private initiatives are equally varied. Some NGOs operate as lobbying bodies for legislation on the local and national level; others educate conservators in history, cultural appreciation, and the more technical tasks of conservation. Still, others center on cultural values embodied by heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Heritage Conservation in the Philippines.</strong> A precursor to heritage conservation in the Philippines was Daniel H. Burnham&rsquo;s response to the suggestion that the American government in the Philippines tear down the walls of Intramuros to allow traffic to flow more smoothly through Manila. In his 1905 proposal for an urban plan of Manila, Burnham proposed to retain Intramuros and keep it as intact as possible because of its historical and cultural value and build the new city of Manila around it. However, because it was infested with malarial mosquitos, the Bureau of Public Works, entrusted with the implementation of Burnham&rsquo;s plan, decided to fill the Intramuros moat and convert it to a green space, which later became a golf course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The destruction of the Philippines, especially of Manila, at the end of World War II was devastating. The reconstruction of Manila and the rest of the Philippines began with the conscious objective of immediate reconstruction of damaged buildings and structures, especially public ones, to make them serviceable again and allow the continuity of institutions. Rebuilding was necessary in order to return to normalcy, the rebuilding of the social order and economic recovery. Funds for rebuilding were managed through the War Damage Claims office, which distributed money to the public and private sectors. Funds also came from Japan as part of their war restitution. Government buildings were rebuilt following original plans, but in some cases were simplified. For instance, the elaborate ceiling of the Central Post Office in Manila was not reconstructed and the detached colonnade at the ends of the Legislative building was replaced by pilasters. Within a decade and a half, much had been rebuilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But many more buildings remained in ruins and were never rebuilt. For instance, from the 1950s to the 1960s, Intramuros remained abandoned as the religious orders moved their principal churches or houses elsewhere: the Dominicans, Franciscans, Jesuits, and Capuchins to Quezon City; the Recollects to San Sebastian in Quiapo; the brothers of San Juan de Dios to Pasay City.The University of Santo Tomas moved to the Sampaloc district.The Ateneo de Manila campus, which had moved out of Intramuros because of the 1932 fire, moved even further away from Ermita&mdash;all the way to Loyola Heights in Quezon City.The Colegio de Santa Isabel moved to Taft Ave while the Real Monasterio de Santa Clara moved to Quezon City, on a bluff overlooking Marikina Valley.Of the damaged churches, only the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> was rebuilt.Although it retained the Romanesque lines of its historic design, the interior and the decorative details were all new, the result of creative interaction between Filipino and Italian artists.The rebuilt cathedral was consecrated in 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for the rest of Intramuros, high-rise buildings, apartments, and commercial strips were built in utter disregard of the Spanish colonial style, which was still visible in spite of all the damage.The green area around the walls became a garbage dump and a bus terminal.The stones of the wall were quarried for new constructions, and Intramuros became the haven for the urban poor and a parking lot for cargo trucks and container vans because of its close proximity to the port.Streets and plazas were reconfigured into parking lots or fenced in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Belatedly, the government issued guidelines in the 1950s that all rebuilding in Intramuros should be in the Spanish style of architecture, but did not specify what that meant. The seed of heritage conservation was planted and it started where building in stone began in the Philippines&mdash; Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Historical Institute started working on restoring the walls with the help of civic groups and ad hoc committees; the most active of which were the Intramuros Restoration Committee and the Armed Forces Ladies&rsquo; Committee. In 1966, they repaired the gates and restored <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>&rsquo;s moat and other structures, like the Fort&iacute;n de San Francisco and the Basti&oacute;n de Santa Lucia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1979, the Intramuros Administration (IA) was created by Presidential Decree 1616 and placed under the Ministry of Human Settlements.The IA worked out a comprehensive plan regarding development and zoning of Intramuros.It built Casa Manila and a row of replica houses beside it, restored several plazas, particularly Plaza Roma and Plaza Sampalucan, Puerta Santa Lucia, and the revellin of Puerta del Parian.The IA continues to supervise Intramuros restoration.It is currently reconstructing the Church of San Ignacio, the original church of the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, which will be reused as a museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The restoration of the walls of Intramuros were an early laboratory of heritage conservation. The walls were repaired with a mixture of adobe, lime, and cement. During the Marcos presidency, which was from 1965 to 1986, the restoration of Intramuros and other heritage sites was supported by the government. Work was done on the San Agustin Church in Intramuros and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/376\">Santa Ana Church</a>. In fact, a precolonial gravesite was discovered at Santa Ana, and excavated by the National Museum. In Batac, Ilocos Norte, the house where nationalist painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> was born was rebuilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Synthetic adobe was developed in the 1970s, and initially used in the construction of domestic architecture that strove to look colonial. This consisted of crushed adobe mixed with cement and applied as a finish to walls. When the finish had dried, the smoothed surface of the wall was chipped to create the illusion of adobe. Often, while the wall was drying, grooves were cut into the surface to simulate the look of cut stone. This technology, which had been used for the walls of Intramuros, was also used to resurface the San Agustin and Santa Ana Churches. The popularity of synthetic adobe spread and became the common technique used in restoration. The long-term result was disastrous. The new layer formed a barrier that did not allow moisture to escape and caused more damage on the stone walls, which originally were finished with a soft lime plaster called <strong>palitada</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a number of instances, where the palitada had degraded and exposed the stones or bricks, which was the structural core of a wall, many thought that these stones or bricks were the original surface of the wall. Because they looked antique and romantic, many architects and engineers removed the palitada. The effect was the rapid degradation of the structural material, because its barrier against the elements, especially waterproofing, had been removed. The result was a disaster. Walls started to leak and erode. Vegetation grew on the moist material and threatened to crack the stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a lack of research and information on historic architecture and technique of construction. There were a handful of professional restoration architects, who often worked on more modern projects as their main job and worked on restoration when need arose. There were almost no technicians and workers competent in working with historic buildings. On top of that, there was the gap in the knowledge of the general public about heritage sites and structures and their importance and significance. Hence, until the present, heritage conservation is plagued with controversies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Continuing Controversies.</strong> The demolition of the iconic Jai Alai building in Manila on 15 Jul 2000 put the issue of heritage conservation in the Philippines into the spotlight. This case highlighted the desecration of the country&rsquo;s heritage sites in the consciousness of the public. The heritage law prohibits anything that would impede the direct view of a heritage site or would introduce new materials incompatible to that of the old structure, affecting its integrity and authenticity, thus diminishing its value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jai Alai fiasco was just the start of a string of issues concerning the plight of the nation&rsquo;s built heritage. Other cases followed. The replacement of the wooden trusses of Laoag church by steel in 2003 to 2004 was met with stern opposition from heritage advocates, saying the added weight of the new steel structure will affect the stability of the church walls. In 2004, an adoration chapel was illegally constructed at the courtyard of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">Taal Basilica</a>. Nine years later, another illegal structure, this time a multipurpose hall, was constructed at the courtyard located at the left side of the church. The project was stopped by a court order issued in 2013 because it violated the heritage law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important edifice which suffered the same fate as the Jai Alai building is the old Meralco building in San Marcelino St, Manila. The streamlined modern art deco structure designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, with the relief of Italian sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\">Francesco Monti</a> titled <strong><em>The Furies</em></strong>, was completely demolished in 2013 to give way to a condominium project and a fast-food store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Incorrect intervention approaches, poor maintenance, wanton disregard of the significance of the country&rsquo;s important heritage structures coupled with ignorance or simply the defiance of the heritage law are just some of the reasons why heritage conservation remains a concern. The overlapping of tasks by government cultural agencies is also partly to be blamed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Paoay church restoration in Ilocos Norte in 2012 became controversial since the result, according to heritage advocates, was far from what was expected. What used to be a relief of a moon on one side of the facade is now a sun, copied from the sun relief on the other side. Some of its cornices, which used to be thin, are now thicker after the conservation works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ancestral houses on Vigan&rsquo;s Mestizo district have earned praises for their conservation management programs, but the commercialization of the area made it more of a business district in recent years. Another example is the Las Casas Filipinas de Acuzar in Bagac, Bataan where ancestral houses from all over the Philippines are transplanted, piece by piece, to serve as restaurants, shops, events places, and suites. This case has caught the ire of heritage advocates who question the transfer of structures from their original sites, which lessen or erase their heritage value. This particular issue of transferring structures remains unanswered and needs more study and debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Sep 2014, a series of heritage conservation issues hounded the City of Manila, starting with the controversial redevelopment project of the Army Navy Club building which reduced the historic edifice into a mere shell. The stripping of the building was done without a detailed engineering study as required by law. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2683\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</a> was forced to issue a cease-and-desist order against the developer, which was later lifted after the development plan submitted by the architectural firm hired by the developer was accepted by the NHCP. The developer also paid a penalty for violating the heritage law. This case was followed by the demolition of the Admiral Hotel on Roxas Blvd in Malate as well as the nearby Michel Apartments&mdash;both prewar buildings designed by well-known architects. Preceding these events was the controversy on the construction of the 49-story Torre de Manila condominium project near Taft Ave, which mars the vista of the iconic Rizal Monument in Luneta, a declared National Monument and a National Cultural Treasure. On 5 Jan 2015, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> issued a cease-and-desist order against its developer, saying the project affects the physical integrity of the park and the monument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another heritage conservation issue was the National Museum project on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\">Fort Pilar</a> in Zamboanga City in 2014, when palitada was applied on the inner brick walls. The project attracted the ire of the locals who reacted to the modern appearance of the walls, which were in fact originally covered with palitada. The palitada&rsquo;s removal was the result of neglect. Photographic evidence from the 1950s showed that all the buildings inside Fort Pilar had a layer of palitada and whitewash. Obviously, the degradation of the buildings&rsquo;s walls was because of a lack of maintenance, which is much needed because the fort stands near the seashore, exposing it to seawater spray and wind. An earlier intervention outside the fort was able to renovate and embellish the Shrine of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar. A permanent altar, a small chapel, and images of saints were mounted on a new perimeter wall. The shrine once attracted the Muslims who honored Mary as the mother of Jesus, but they have since shied away from it, possibly offended by the many statues on the perimeter fence. In 2014, also in Zamboanga, a faction of the Moro National Liberation Front invaded the city and a three-week siege ensued causing damage to the 19th-century Taluksangay Mosque as the Philippine military bombarded the occupied area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the given examples, other man-made threats to heritage include fire, war, and natural calamities. The Oct 2013 earthquake and the subsequent supertyphoon Yolanda, international codename Haiyan, damaged or destroyed many churches in the Visayas, particularly in the island-province of Bohol, Cebu, Samar, and Leyte. National cultural as well as private agencies and individuals faced the difficult task of assessing the damage wrought on these religious edifices. The churches of Dimiao, Panglao, Baclayon, Cortes, Dauis, Loay, and Loboc were considered restorable. Most likely nonrestorable on their original sites are the churches of Maribojoc and Loon. Both in ruins, Maribojoc sits on a geological fault and Loon&rsquo;s plateau or Ibabao is riddled with sinkholes. Old bridges and watchtowers in Bohol were also affected by the powerful quake, including the restored tower of Balilihan and the Fuerza de San Vicente Ferrer at Punta Cruz in Maribojoc. In the neighboring island of Cebu, the upper portion of the belfry of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Santo Ni&ntilde;o Basilica</a> collapsed. The church was closed to the public in the aftermath of the earthquake and was reopened only on 24 Dec 2014. Meanwhile, the church of Guiuan in Eastern Samar, which was destroyed by Yolanda in 2013, is undergoing reconstruction. The restoration and reconstruction of all damaged churches and important structures mentioned may take years to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions, floods, tsunamis, typhoons, and the resulting storm surges also pose a threat to heritage structures. In 1814, the violent eruption of the Mayon Volcano in Albay buried the then town of Cagsawa and destroyed the church. Today, only the belfry of the church remains standing above ground. The violent earthquake of 1863 sent the Manila Cathedral crashing to the ground, entombing the cathedral chapter and the many people who had gathered for evening prayers during the eve of Corpus Christi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, strong earthquakes in 1863 and 1880 damaged churches and other structures in Manila and neighboring provinces. Another powerful earthquake in 1948 damaged and destroyed a number of churches in the province of Iloilo; the most notable of these is the neo-Gothic church of Oton, known for its Greek cross plan and central <strong>retablo</strong> that had a tall spire as center and four altars corresponding to the four arms of the cruciform plan. In 1983, churches and other structures in the Ilocos region were also affected by an earthquake. The church of Vintar was reconstructed as a result of that tremor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mid-1990s, the church of Bacolor in Pampanga was half buried as a result of the lahar flow from the 1991 eruption of Pinatubo. Between two to three meters of lahar buried the Bacolor Church and other towns and villages along the Porac-Potrero River. The highway linking San Fernando and Olongapo, Zambales was covered with lahar and had to be raised and rebuilt. Over many years, floods threatened San Fernando and reached south to Minalin, because lahar had raised the ground level surrounding San Fernando.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, Typhoon Glenda, international codename Rammasun, damaged more than 30 heritage houses in Unisan, Quezon. These houses suffered varying damages on walls and roofs. The storm also damaged the town&rsquo;s Spanish-era municipal hall. Tropical Storm Seniang, international codename Jangmi, the last weather disturbance to hit the Philippines in 2014, affected several provinces in Mindanao and Visayas, including the already earthquake-hit Bohol. The town of Loboc, including its church, was submerged by flood due to heavy rains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Promising Developments.</strong> Three developments promise to boost the cause of heritage conservation in the Philippines. First is the growing awareness of the importance of heritage conservation seen in the establishment of the Heritage Conservation Society (HCS) in the Philippines, which was an initiative of the private sector. Established in Manila to serve as an advocacy group, HCS has given rise to similar heritage conservation groups outside Manila, like Iloilo and Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporting the work of HCS is the increasing number of publications regarding architecture in the Philippines. As scholars and writers go through archives and libraries, updated information has become available. Foreign scholars have also taken an interest in the Philippines. The internet has also facilitated the spread of information. Photographic archives of historical Philippine subjects from public repositories and individuals in the Philippines and abroad are now available online, enriching the data bank of anyone interested in heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A second development is the training of the craftsmen and artisans who work in restoration. Escuela Taller, initially supported by the Spanish government, has brought in Mexican and Filipino masters to teach restoration technologies to students from the poor sectors of Metro Manila. Subjects on stonework, masonry, historic formulas of cement, decorative painting, and more mundane subjects like plumbing and electricity are taught. Its students are now beginning to make a difference in the proper restoration of heritage structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third development is the more active participation of government agencies in the work of conservation. The NHCP has increased its output in placing historical and cultural markers on important structures and sites. It has also declared sites as historical, or as heritage corridors, like Dapitan. The NCCA, in cooperation with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>, has declared some structures and artifacts as National Cultural Treasures or Important Cultural Properties. Such a declaration means that the government is bound to protect the property and can offer assistance should repair be called for. As culmination to the long effort to raise consciousness regarding the value of heritage, Republic Act No. 10066 National Cultural Heritage Act was signed into law in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A notable success in heritage conservation is the restoration of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/305\">Gota de Leche</a> building, a neo-Renaissance structure that was completed in 1917 for an organization that fostered the health of women and children. It received honorable mention from the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Heritage Award for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The art deco buildings of Far Eastern University were competently restored. In preparation for nomination as World Heritage Site, the palitada of San Agustin was restored. The destructive synthetic adobe was removed, replaced by soft lime plaster, following the formulas of the Spanish colonial era. Escuela Taller restored the Almacenes Reales in Intramuros and the building at the Bastion de Santa Barbara in Fort Santiago, Intramuros. The prewar houses in Pasay City have been reused as hotels, as exemplified by the Henry Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The provinces are not without their success stories. The Lopez Mansion, straddling the boundary of La Paz and Jaro in Iloilo, was restored to its former Streamline Moderne style. The declaration of Iloilo&rsquo;s central business district as a heritage zone by the NHCP has spurred urban renewal and the cleaning and restoration of pre-World War II buildings, mostly in the neoclassical or art deco style. The arcaded side walk, a feature of Iloilo urban architecture, is being rediscovered as a practical solution to an island battered by heavy rain and intense summer heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Education, since the time of Corazon Aquino&rsquo;s presidency from 1986 to 1992, has been restoring the Gabaldon school houses and the high school buildings constructed during the American era. The high school at Baguio City is exemplary because it follows all the recommendations of Burnham to build with sensitivity to the surroundings. The use of Baguio limestone as an accent, the green roof and white walls, blend in with the rocks, fog, and trees of Baguio City. With more awareness and enthusiasm for heritage conservation, the Philippines seems ready to preserve its own built heritage.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

In the indigenous tradition, knowledge was handed down orally, or through practice. Anthropologists have surmised that in the indigenous tradition that survives to this day, vestiges of precolonial practice are still evident. However, whatever has remained unmodified in the course of time is uncertain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apprenticeship is the standard path where knowledge of construction, design, and planning is passed on. Often, the master is the head of a family and the apprentices are children and relatives. Some secrets may be guarded by families so that outsiders will not be able to copy what is being taught. Tools, patterns, or models are often passed on from generation to generation. In general, it is men who engage in the task of building dwellings and furniture for the house. For the Ifugao, the <strong>hagabi</strong>, or prestige bench of the<em>kadangyan</em>or the aristocratic class, involves rituals and feasting from the moment wood is procured from the forest to its carving and delivery to the kadangyan&rsquo;s house. Thus, many shamans are also artisans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paete, Laguna is known for its carvers, many specializing in the sculpting of <strong>santos</strong> or saints&rsquo;s images for churches and for home altar. Although its carving tradition is associated with the Spanish era, the techniques used may be older. The Paete tools are similar to other carving types across Southeast Asia. For instance, the mallet for carving is not the truncated Western cone, but a paddle, which is used also by indigenous groups in the Philippines. The Paete carver rarely uses a vise to steady a piece of wood, especially if the image being carved is below one meter. Instead, the wood block is fixed on a carving table and wedged to steady it. If Paete has preserved precolonial traditions, then its method of transmitting knowledge may point to a deeply rooted cultural practice. Here, woodcarvers are organized by families, where knowledge and skills, even a particular style of carving, are passed on from generation to generation. Even as a child, the Paete&ntilde;o may work in his father&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>talyer&nbsp;</em>or shop. Starting with the simple task of sandpapering and carving, the child is told to copy simple models under the supervision of an adult. Eventually, as the child grows, more complex tasks are given, including doing the rough work for an image the master carver will finish. Analogously, the same may be said of the Ifugao carvers of the Cordillera. Among them, carving is traditionally not done for the sake of ornamentation only; it has religious significance and is accompanied by specific rituals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Builders of the <strong>bahay kubo</strong> (nipa hut) have traditionally prescribed guidelines when to cut bamboo to prevent rot and insect infestation. This is usually done during the cold months of late November to February, when the bamboo has stopped growing and has hardened. &ldquo;Taga sa panahon,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cut at the proper time,&rdquo; is the Tagalog adage for bamboo that is suitable for construction. Bamboo is cured by submerging it in water. Where the sea is close by, bamboo is immersed in salt water to cure it. The laying of the nipa or grass thatch is passed on orally or through the process of imitation. In Panay Island, nipa thatch is laid either tightly or loosely. The tighter and thicker thatch is more expensive because it uses more material and takes more time to build. The distance between thatches is determined using a matchbox. If the distance between the thatch is equivalent to the shorter side of the match box (<strong>nagahigda</strong>, literally &ldquo;lying on its side&rdquo;) or roughly 4 cm, this produces a tighter roof; if the distance is equivalent to the longer side of the match box (<strong>nagatindog</strong>, or &ldquo;standing with the longer side up&rdquo;) roughly 6 cm, this produces a looser thatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"spanish\" name=\"spanish\"></a>Spanish Colonial Era</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written manuals came during the Spanish colonial era. They assumed a culture where writing had replaced oral instruction. Manuals were also a convenient way to transfer knowledge beyond the talyer to a wider audience. The appearance and proliferation of the architectural manual in Renaissance Europe was facilitated by the advent of the movable type printing press. Manuals were written and copied by friars and engineers, who drew from field experience and from the locals themselves, but only a few of these have survived. Published books and journal articles brought into the country enriched the archives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation of towns in Spanish overseas colonies was prescribed among other things in the <strong><em>Leyes de Indias</em></strong> (Laws of the Indies) decreed by Philip II on 3 Jul 1575 (Lico 2008, 110-13). The site chosen for a settlement should be vacant or otherwise should not be occupied without the free consent of the natives. It should be elevated, rich in resources, and have enough area for future development. Detailed instructions were given on the laying out of streets according to a <strong>cuadricula</strong> or grid plan. The starting point for the building of the town was the plaza. In inland towns, it was to be in the middle, its length at least one and a half times its width because this proportion was the best for festivals when horses were used. First place was to be given to the local church, which should occupy a whole block. In inland towns, the church was to be some distance from the plaza and separate from other buildings so it could be visible from all sides. Next would be the Royal and Town Council House, the Customs House, arsenal, and hospital for the poor and sick of noncontagious diseases. None of these was to obstruct the view of the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drawing from the Mediterranean experience, the streets needed to be narrow. The four corners of the plaza were to face the four compass points, so that the streets would not be directly exposed to the four principal winds. This was the case in Intramuros, where one side of the street enjoyed some shade at most times of the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A town near a seaport was to have its plaza and main church near the landing place, with the church clearly visible and strong enough to serve as a defense. Though not quite observable today, this plan was followed by Vigan City. When the river was still navigable, boats landed at the foot of the Vigan plateau, and people ascended a series of steps leading to the cathedral plaza. These steps still exist today.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Leyes</em></strong> codified much of what had already been practiced in classic Mediterranean planning, as enunciated by the Roman architect Vitruvius and the Italian Renaissance architect Leon Battista Alberti. Manila was laid out along a grid before the <strong><em>Leyes</em></strong> had been promulgated. Additionally, this revival of the grid-plaza complex became popular in key Spanish cities like Madrid and Salamanca only in the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Prevenciones y Disposiciones para Fabrica de Casa Nueba</em></strong> (Preventions and Provisions for the Construction of a New House) is a 50-page, incomplete, anonymous, and undated architectural manual found in the Dominican archives in the University of Santo Tomas (UST). From details in the text, it seems to have been written by an Augustinian based in San Agustin, Intramuros. For scale and measurements, constant reference was made to a large house on No 136 behind the Misericordia and the two others next to it. If the Misericordia referred to the hospital run the Hospitallers of San Juan de Dios in 1656, the manuscript is early indeed. However, the copy at UST seems to have been prepared in the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong><em>Prevenciones</em></strong> provide exquisitely detailed advice on the sources, transport, selection, preparation, installation, and maintenance of the various types of lumber and masonry to be used in a building. The pillars, trusses, and other wooden components of a house are individually described and prescribed, including <strong>baraquilos</strong> and <strong>baratexas</strong>, <strong>boncalos</strong>, <strong>canales maestras</strong>, <strong>llaves</strong>, <strong>pilares</strong> and <strong>pilaretes</strong>, <strong>quilos</strong> and <strong>sobrequilos</strong>, <strong>soleras</strong>, <strong>tablas</strong>, <strong>tablasuelos</strong>, <strong>tajilanes</strong>, <strong>tirantes</strong>, and <strong>trozos</strong>. The best molave pillars were sourced from San Miguel, Bulacan; the horizontal beams had to be of <strong>betis</strong> or <strong>pasac</strong>, sourced from Lubao, Gapan, or Arayat. Rafts of these logs were floated down Laguna de Bay or Mariveles during the dry months following February. The logs had to be stripped of the termite-attracting bark called <strong>banacal</strong> before being thoroughly dried. These were worked and processed into lumber which resembled bars of soap and were called <strong>jabonados</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Large stone blocks called <strong>sillares</strong> were used for facades and arches, while smaller blocks, or <strong>sillaretes</strong>, were used to frame windows. Slightly thinner blocks called <strong>tablillas de ciudad</strong> were meant for walls, while <strong>tablillas</strong><strong>ordinarias</strong> were laid on pavements. The best stone came from Meycauayan, Bulacan, which was superior to that from Guadalupe or San Juan del Monte nearer Manila. The mortar was to flow into all the spaces between the gravel in the foundations, or in between walls, and was to be poured in after every layer of gravel. Gravel and sand had to be washed thoroughly so that no salt was left; beach sand was to be avoided. To strengthen the mortar (which was called <strong>lechada</strong> or <strong>mezcla</strong> ), a little molasses (<strong>miel de ca&ntilde;a</strong>) was added. The <strong>palitada</strong> had to be applied when the walls were wet, and inner walls had to be applied thinly, and then polished. To strengthen the foundation and walls against earthquakes, a <strong>sillar</strong> or <strong>tablilla</strong> was half embedded in the rubble layer, to act as an anchor for the next layer (Jose 2003).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another manual that became popular during the Spanish colonial period was written by a priest. After building the church of Santo Ni&ntilde;o in Cebu from 1735 to 1740, Fr Juan Albarran, OSA, wrote down his experiences and advice in an 18-page manuscript now preserved in the Augustinian Archives in Valladolid, Spain. Entitled <strong><em>Advertencias para Obras que se Puedan Ofrecer en Este Convento</em></strong>, (Annoucements of Works that May Be Offered in This Convent) the work provides detailed instructions on the components and construction of walls, openings, supports, and roofs. Albarran manifests knowledge of Andrea Palladio&rsquo;s <strong><em>First Book of Architecture</em></strong> (translated into Spanish in 1570), Fray Lorenzo de San Nicolas&rsquo;s <strong><em>Arte y Uso de Arquitectura</em></strong> (Art and Use of Architecture), 1639-64, Juan de Arfe&rsquo;s <strong><em>De Varia Conmensuracion</em></strong> (Of Various Commensuration), 1587, and Juan Bautista de Villapando&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tratado de la Arquitectura Perfecta</em></strong> (Treaty of Perfect Architecture), 1604. Some of his procedures echo those from classic works: the preparation of lime for the mortar is similar to that recommended by the Renaissance theoretician Leon Battista Alberti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lime could be obtained not just from the rocks called <strong>manongol,</strong> but from other white outcrops in the area, even from the gravel used as filling (<strong>piedra vitoca</strong> or <strong>cascaxo</strong>) in the walls. The limestone was to be chopped into bits to be cooked in a lime kiln or <strong>calero</strong>; the firewood was to equal the stone to be cooked. The island of Mactan was an ideal source for cut stone or tablillas, filling, and lime. Black sand was preferred to white, and had to be washed thoroughly so that salt, which absorbed water, or earth, which contained the seeds of plants, could be eliminated. Lime quarried from the mountain needed one more part sand, compared to the two parts required for one part lime from the beach. However, it was still best to experiment with different proportions to obtain the proper mixture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally, walls of cut stone were to have two rows of stone blocks alternate with one laid perpendicularly. Because this was difficult to achieve in Cebu, an alternative was to have large stones laid within the walls to anchor the layers above.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Father Albarran provided careful diagrams for the computations of arches and roof trusses. A round or <strong>medio-punto</strong> arch was derived from a circle; an oblong arch or <strong>carpanelo maior</strong> was obtained from two overlapping circles; while a low oblong arch, <strong>carpanelo menor</strong> or <strong>rebajado</strong> was drawn from the arcs of three circles. The <strong>cuadrado</strong>, or square, of one <strong>braza</strong> by one braza (approximately one yard by one yard) was recommended as the simple basis of proportion for the expanse and height of walls and facades .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Dominicans in Pangasinan were known to have written &ldquo;Modo de te&ntilde;ir madera&rdquo; (method of staining wood), &ldquo;Modo de hacer ladrillos&rdquo; (methods of brick-making), and &ldquo;Modo de soldar hierro&rdquo; (method of soldering iron), but none of these works have been located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from these manuals, little more than a handful of published treatises on architecture has been found in colonial-era libraries. In UST, there are preserved works by Serlio, 1566; Arfe, 1675; Pozzo, 1693; Derand, 1755; an anonymous treatise on the work of Sulzer and Mengs, 1786; and Vitruvius, 1787. An especially rare find is Dominguez Zamudio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Theses Mathematicas</em></strong> printed in Manila in 1766.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sebastiano Serlio&rsquo;s <strong><em>D&rsquo;Architettura</em></strong>, 1566, presents in five well-illustrated chapters geometry, perspective, the great buildings of Rome, the five orders of architecture, and plans of palaces and churches. A 1675 Madrid edition of Juan de Arfe y Villafa&ntilde;e&rsquo;s <strong><em>Varia Conmensuracion para la Escultura y Arquitectura</em></strong> (Various Conmensuration for Sculpture and Architecture) was owned by the Filipino sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a>. It passed on to the art collector Alfonso T. Ongpin, whose granddaughter Cynthia O. Valdes then donated the book to the UST Library. Arfe divides his <strong><em>Varia</em></strong> into four books that deal with geometry, the drawing of the human figure, the drawing of animals, and the proportions of architecture and ecclesiastical objects. How the <strong><em>Varia</em></strong> came into the possession of Tampinco is unknown, though the book&rsquo;s 300 diagrams could very well have influenced its readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Perspectiva Pictorum et Architectorum</em></strong>, published in 1693 by Andrea Pozzo, SJ, is a large-format book (about the size of a tabloid newspaper) composed of 100 annotated plates featuring architectural details and plans. This book, by the 17th-century baroque painter of the frescoes in San Ignazio, Rome, belonged to the Colegio de San Ignacio in Manila. <strong><em>L&rsquo;Architecture des Voutes ou L&rsquo;Art des Traits et Coupes des Voutes</em></strong> published in 1755 by Francois Derand, the Jesuit librarian of the Sorbonne, demonstrates the calculation for arches and vaults in several illustrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anonymous, <strong><em>Dell&rsquo;Arte di Vedere nelle Belle arti del Disegno Secondo i Principi de Sulzer, e di Mengs</em></strong>, 1786, does not have illustrations but has a chapter on the visual appreciation of buildings according to the principles of Sulzer and Mengs. The buildings selected were all from Rome, such as the Colosseum, Saint Peter&rsquo;s, Sant&rsquo;Andrea della Valle, and the Farnese Palace. A sumptuous Spanish edition of Marcus Vitruvius&rsquo;s <strong><em>Los Diez Libros de Architectura</em></strong> (Ten Books of Architecture), from 1787, is another tabloid-sized treasure. The 277 pages are complemented by 56 plates engraved from drawings by Joseph Ortiz y Sanz, a priest who translated the work from Latin. <strong><em>Los Diez Libros</em></strong> is composed of 10 chapters that deal with a wide range of topics: the selection of sites; building materials; types of temples; the three types of columns; public buildings; domestic buildings; wall finishings; water and fountains; astronomy and clocks; and machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of great interest is the <strong><em>Theses Mathematicas</em></strong>, defended by Juan Dominguez Zamudio in the Colegio de San Ignacio in Manila and printed by Nicolas de la Cruz Bagay in the Jesuit press in Intramuros in 1766. This is a treatise on fortification which, coming just two years after the British occupation of Manila, was particularly timely, if not a bit too late. Its 38 pages contain 19 theses, each divided into a number of resolutions. Theses One to Ten deal with <strong>munitoria</strong>, or military architecture. The parts of a fort are described, with recommended measurements and geometrical proportions for each. Theses Eleven to Seventeen deal with <strong>pyrotechnia</strong>, or the art of casting and using cannon. In the last two Theses, the defense or siege of a fortified settlement is discussed. The work is illustrated with foldout copperplate engravings by Cipriano de la Cruz Bagay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1766 <strong><em>Theses Mathematicas</em></strong> forms one of a largely unknown type of scientific literature that involved aspects of architecture. As shown in a recent study, the teaching of mathematics in Manila contributed to a more rational basis for building technology. Similarly titled <strong><em>Theses</em></strong>, this appeared in 1758, 1761, and 1762; all were connected with the Jesuit Colegio de San Ignacio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An inventory of the sequestered library of the Jesuit Colegio de San Ignacio indicates that it had a copy of Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola&rsquo;s <strong><em>Regoli delli Cinque Ordini A&rsquo;architettura</em></strong>, first published in 1562, probably in Rome. Da Vignola was the architect of Il Gesu, the Jesuit mother church in Rome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architecture discipline had another hurdle to overcome in the Philippines&mdash;natural disasters. The earthquake that shook Luzon on 3 Jun 1863 forced the review and reform of building techniques, especially by engineers. After the earthquakes on 18 and 20 Jul 1880 it was noticed that post-1863 buildings repaired or built under government direction suffered relatively less damage than private buildings. Such constructions included the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a, the Cathedral, San Juan de Dios Hospital, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\">Aduana</a>, all in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An official telegram from Madrid on 21 Jul 1880 mandated the Manila government to formulate a plan and technical conditions for the construction of public and private buildings. A set of recommendations by the General Inspection of Public Works was discussed by an ad hoc Consultative Board of Public Works which met in extraordinary session on 27-29 Jul. The recommendations were drawn from assessments of earthquake damage and from data published by the<strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/336\">Manila Observatory</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 30 Jul 1880 the Board released 27 prescriptions: nine of a general nature; five on the liabilities of carpentry; six for woodwork; and seven for masonry. The Board was headed by Manuel Ramirez Bazan, who was the Inspector General of Public Works. It included Eduardo Lopez Navarro, principal discussant and builder of the neo-Romanesque <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> and of Manila&rsquo;s new port system; Genaro Palacios, builder of Manila&rsquo;s water system and of San Sebastian church; Manuel Lopez Bayo, who developed the wharf along the Pasig; Antonio de la C&aacute;mara, who drew plans for the Tabacalera of Binondo; Jose Centeno y Garcia, an expert on mines; and Luis Cespedes, who reformed the Aduana. Except for Cespedes, an architect, the rest were engineers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 16 Aug 1880 the General Inspection of Public Works approved 43 principal rules in the construction or repair of public and private buildings in the Philippines. These concerned location, foundations, cementing of parts, proportions of walls of <strong>mamposteria</strong> or rubblework masonry, buttresses, new additions to old buildings, ceilings, frameworks and their reinforcement, brick walls with frameworks, roofing, and balconies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foundations were to be presupposed to carry twice the weight of the building they would receive. The more homogenous the masonry was, the more resistant it was to earthquakes. The following were also the systems of construction in order of preference: concrete (<strong>hormigon</strong>) whether hydraulic or ordinary; brickwork; cut stone with ribs of brick; and cut stone (<strong>sillarejo</strong> and <strong>silleria</strong>). Materials with different elasticities were to be avoided. Frameworks of iron or wood could be faced with the artificial stone known as Victoria Stone that allows cooling air to flow through the interstices. Means of access had to be provided so that the frameworks could be regularly examined. Recommended materials for roofing were flat tiles, galvanized iron, zinc, tin, or similar incombustible material, taking care that there would be sufficient passage for ventilation but not of rainwater. Single-story constructions could be covered with <strong>azoteas</strong> in the style of Cadiz. Ordinary V-shaped tiles were restricted to isolated single-story buildings not meant for habitation, such as storehouses or warehouses. Existing tiles on buildings could be retained only if they were proven stable and if there was a sufficiently protective wooden ceiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The qualities of wood were noted. Only molave and ipil were resistant enough to be brought into direct contact with masonry. Molave was the only wood that could be exposed to the elements, covered with pitch or painted with oil. Floor beams were not to be embedded in the walls but had to rest on interlinked molave. Beams of<em>yakal</em>from Angat were unsurpassable in their resistance to flexing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain bad practices were castigated, such as supporting badly cut stone on slivers or <strong>calzos</strong>; disorderly insertion of rocks in between rows of cut stones; not keeping the materials moist enough before setting them; using salt water in the mortar; using poorly cooked or carbonated lime (if a few drops of acid elicited bubbles from the lime, it had to be rejected); poorly strained mortar; and improper priming of cut stones. The dividing walls called <strong>tabique pampango</strong> were absolutely forbidden, and had to be replaced with walls of metal plates or thin wooden planks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 18 Aug 1880 Gov-Gen Primo de Rivera forwarded these 43 rules to the Spanish Overseas Ministry, accompanied by a set of 18 managerial instructions. All public buildings to be constructed or repaired were first to have their plans, systems of construction, and the budget approved by the General Inspection of Public Works. Before being occupied, a house had to be inspected by the municipal architect who would check its soundness. As soon as possible, all edifices damaged by the recent earthquakes were to be assessed by competent authorities and classified accordingly as: 1) in good condition; 2) in good condition but with specified repairs; 3) dangerous; and 4) ruined. The last two categories carried corresponding plans of action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 43 rules and 18 instructions, collectively called the &ldquo;Earth quake Ordinances&rdquo; were promulgated by Primo de Rivera on the 20 Aug 1880 edition of the <strong><em>Gaceta de Manila</em></strong>. All materials necessary for building in iron, and such parts for roofing as sand, galvanized iron and zinc sheets, and screws were exempted from customs duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the last few years of the Spanish colonial era, Manuel Cortes y Argullo, a military engineer, published a two-volume work, <strong><em>Los Terremotos: sus Efectos en las Edificaciones y Medios Practicos para Evitarlos en lo Posible</em></strong> (Earthquakes: Their Effects on Buildings and Practical Guidelines to Minimize These as far as Possible), in Manila in 1881. The manuscript was originally prepared in 1873 but revised after the 1880 earthquake. Another military engineer, Manuel Herbella y Perez, wrote <strong><em>Manual de Construcciones y Fortificacion de Campa&ntilde;as en Filipinas</em></strong> in Madrid in 1882. Intended for constructions that would accompany military campaigns, especially in Mindanao, it is an important source for building technology in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another engineer, Rafael Cerero y Saenz, was a high official of the Corps of Military Engineers who built military barracks in Mindanao in the 1880s. His plan to fortify Manila, if it had been carried out, could have changed the outcome of the Battle of Manila with the Americans. His <strong><em>Estudio Sobre la Resistencia y Estabilidad de los Edificios Sometidos a Huracanes y Terremotos</em></strong> or &ldquo;A Study on the Resistance and Stability of Buildings Subjected to Hurricanes and Earthquakes&rdquo; was written in Manila in 1889 and published in Madrid in 1890. He drew on his own experiences in the field, as well as from copious data shared by Fr Federico Faura, SJ, who was the Director of the Manila Observatory. He also makes references to materials from the Smithsonian Institute and from scholarly institutions in London, Paris, Rome, Berlin, and Tokyo, which gives us a glimpse of the breadth and depth of the library of the Corps of Engineers in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cerero provides detailed recommendations on the construction of buildings given the propensity of the Philippines to experience natural disasters. Complicated equations provide the proper specifications for height, width, and depth of various parts of the house. The best model was still an edifice with a ground story of masonry and an upper one of wood, provided it was well-anchored. It had a multiplicity of joints that were perfectly joined, and it swayed &ldquo;like an inverted pendulum&rdquo; during earthquakes. Tall structures should not be attached to lower buildings because they had different resonation arcs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The works of the last two decades of the 19th century give a picture of the introduction of modern materials for construction. There was Portland cement, used in the reconstruction of Manila Cathedral from 1872 to 1879. Also available in Manila markets were pozzolana cement, flat-glazed roof tiles, iron fittings from the United States (US), and Victoria Stone from Australia. Iron was specially recommended by builders. It had already been recommended for the Manila Cathedral in 1872 but was modified to molave sheathed in iron. An offshore lighthouse in San Nicolas, Tondo, was planned to be made of iron in 1876 by Jose Echevarria. The Earthquake Ordinances preferred rigid frameworks of iron for public edifices, especially if they were meant to contain large numbers of people, such as churches. They were only to be substituted with wood if the cost is impractical. Lintels were to be supported on iron or wood. Ceilings were to be of hollow voussoirs or <strong>dovelas</strong> of baked clay embedded in iron bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architectural manuals were very useful in the Spanish colonial era when professional architects and engineers were scarce. But by the turn of the 19th century, more professional architects and engineers were arriving from Spain. One such Spanish architect was Juan Jose Hervas, who had flourishing career from 1855 to 1893 in Manila. With the opening of the Suez Canal in Nov 1869, travel between the Philippines and Europe was considerably cut short and some Filipinos were able to study in European schools. After completing their studies, they returned to the Philippines to practice their profession. Such was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas</a>, who left the Philippines in 1840 and spent more than a decade in Europe. He studied at Real Academia de Notables Artes de San Fernando, Madrid. He returned to Manila in 1854 to practice architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>American Colonial Era</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the aims of American colonial rule was to construct a colony reflective of the philosophy and aims of American colonization. The Americans introduced modern methods of construction and systematized construction through the Bureau of Public Works and a system of licensing and evaluation by the municipal bureaucracy. They promoted the use of material and building techniques like new reinforced concrete using hydraulic cement, popularly known as Portland cement, and reinforcing steel bars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architectural manuals were effective in disseminating knowledge and kept up with the aggressive building program pursued by the American colonial government. This program followed a four-fold path. First, the Bureau of Public Works was organized to oversee the construction of public buildings like city and town halls, schools, markets, and hospitals. Second, with the establishment of the Bureau standard, plans for schools, military barracks, and other public buildings were drawn up. These plans guided the development of public structures but because government architects were allowed to develop a private practice, these structures would have a strong influence on the rest of architecture. Third, Filipinos were sent as<em>pensionados</em>or scholars to study in the universities in the United States. After completing their studies, the pensionados usually worked with the Bureau but were also allowed to keep a private professional practice. Fourth, trade schools were organized in many provincial centers under the Bureau of Education. The linchpin of this system was the Philippine School of Arts and Trade, now the Technological University of the Philippines (TUCP) on Ayala Blvd and San Marcelino St in Manila. Industrial education was emphasized in the primary and secondary schools curriculum, and talented students were encouraged to enroll in the provincial trade schools or in the main school in Manila. Private schools that specialized in architecture were also permitted to operate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, upon the arrival of the Americans, public works was assumed by the Department of War. In 1902, with the establishment of civil rule, the Bureau of Engineering and Construction of Public Works and the Bureau of Architecture and Construction of Public Buildings were created by Philippine Commission Act Nos 22 and 268. The Bureau was placed under the Department of Commerce and Police and continued to remain under the department until 1916, when it was reorganized as the Department of Commerce and Communications, following Reorganization Act No 2666. When the Philippine Legislature met in 1931, the Department was renamed Department of Public Works and Communications (DPWC).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bureau of Public Works set the stage for the development of architecture and the transmission of knowledge through master plans for sanitation and health, city planning and infrastructure development, and the construction of public buildings: government centers, hospitals and clinics, and schools. On 15 Aug 1898, public works was placed under the US Army Corps of Engineers during the military government under Gen Arthur MacArthur. The first priority was to build military forts in Luzon and Cebu. Harry Allyn, the supervising architect, designed wooden barracks in Fort McKinley in the style of Swiss chalets. Plans were drawn to guide future construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bureau of Health, another participant in the development of architecture, with the assistance of the Bureau of Public Works, drew up plans for small detached houses, with a bath and veranda. They also designed the Antipolo latrine and a plan for a sanitary barrio to foster health and sanitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1912, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William<strong> </strong>Parsons</a> designed the prototypes for the public school buildings all over the Philippines, funded by the Philippine Assembly for one million pesos. Isauro Gabaldon, a member of the Philippine Assembly, authored the bill, so the school buildings were identified with him. The plans were published by the Bureau of Education in 1912 as <strong><em>Bulletin No 37, School Buildings and School Grounds</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More architects were trained through study. The initative of sending<em>pensionados</em>or scholars to study in the United States was part of the colonial plan. Among these pensionados were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2702\">Antonio Ma&ntilde;alac Toledo</a>. After graduating, these pensionados joined the Bureau of Public Works. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a> were among the leading architects who worked for the Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines, the establishment of trade schools was supported by the monthly periodical, <strong><em>The Philippine Craftsman</em></strong>, published by the Bureau of Education. It was addressed to teachers, as indicated by its subtitle: &ldquo;A magazine published in Manila by the Bureau of Education devoted to the advancement of industrial instruction in the Public Schools of the Philippines.&rdquo; The magazine carried a variety of articles, including documentation of traditional basketry; reports on crafts from other countries, like lace making in Europe; experiments on introducing new craft and skills; woodworking and other building skills. American scholar Alfred McCoy writes: &ldquo;From 1912 to 1917, the bureau [of education] published a glossy, illustration-filled monthly magazine called the <strong><em>Philippine Craftsman</em></strong>, which was intended to keep teachers abreast of the progress of industrial education. Each issue included at least half a dozen substantive articles relevant to the work being done in the classrooms&mdash;studies of individual handicrafts in the Philippines, discussing gardening techniques and furniture making, and countless pieces&rdquo; (McCoy 1995, 155).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Privately run architectural schools were also established and given a government license to operate. One of the most notable predecessors to modern architectural schools was Liceo de Manila, founded 1900, which opened an architecture program in 1902. Liceo ceased to exist in 1912. Tomas Mapua, after working for the Bureau of Public Works, established Mapua Institute of Technology in 1925. It was known for producing civil engineers who were important team members in any construction. The University of Santo Tomas followed in 1930 and Adamson University in 1941. The University of the Philippines (UP) also proposed a course in architecture but was turned down in 1928. Architecture in UP was not established until 1956.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American era worked on the model of a highly organized architecture profession, supported by civil engineers, and competent craftsmen, supervised and controlled by a bureau which provided the dissemination and promotion of architecture as suited to the environment, and taking advantage of developments in material and building technology. University-trained architects and engineers who planned and supervised construction had a well-trained technical staff to realize their plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The level of training depended on where the technicians had trained. Those who went to the schools of arts and trades usually landed a higher position, like that of a supervisor, than those who had finished only basic education. Thus, during the American era, a plan was created to teach construction and crafts skills, not through manuals alone, but through engagement in the work under the supervision of teachers and trained technicians. Within four decades, the American colonial government had accomplished so much that it steered the development of architecture toward modern styles and methods but remained sensitive to the tropical surroundings of the Philippines and its cultural and architectural legacy. The grand plan was not fully realized and came to a halt when World War II erupted in 1941.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"period\" name=\"period\"></a>Period of the Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American colonial era set the trajectory for the postwar transmission of architectural knowledge. While the DPWC ceased to function during the Japanese occupation, it reopened in 1946, despite constraints due to limited human resources, funds, materials, and equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The immediate postwar period faced the task of reconstruction and modernization. In 1951, DPWC was reconstituted as the Department of Public Works, Transportation, and Communications (DPWTC). As an expanded department, it took charge of telecommunications, motor vehicles, irrigation, flood control, the Radio Control Board, the National Transportation Board, and the Government Quarters Committee. In 1972, the department was reorganized following the program set during the Martial Law era. With the adoption of a revised constitution in 1979, the department came to be known as a ministry. In the post-Marcos era, Executive Order No 123, of 30 Jan 1987 reorganized the ministry and it was now known as Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH). The functions of this department are analogous to those prevailing during the American era, particularly overseeing public construction. Increasingly, DPWH has contracted construction out to private companies, maintaining a supervisory role for itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as the DPWH descends directly from the Bureau, the system of architectural education on tertiary level builds directly on the educational system of the American era after World War II. The schools of arts and trades were reopened, but gradually the lure of technical jobs diminished. These schools devoted to arts and crafts evolved into universities offering a variety of academic fields like liberal arts, fine arts, and science, alongside the technical and technological courses like engineering, industrial technology, and industrial education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building codes in the Philippines can be traced back to the 19th century such as the Earthquake Ordinances promulgated by Gov-Gen Primo de Rivera in the 20 Aug 1880 edition of the <strong><em>Gaceta de Manila</em></strong> <em>.</em>These ordinances are the forerunner of the 1972 Republic Act No 6541, known as the National Building Code. While the Building Code does not give any specifications about the aesthetics of design, the Code&rsquo;s intent being to safeguard public safety, the prescriptions and restrictions of the code are guidelines that sound design should base itself on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 21st century, because of advances in architectural theory, concept, and design, supported by advances in engineering and the development of new material, a single architectural manual is no longer viable as a response to the demands of contemporary architecture and construction. However, the straightforward architectural manual of the Spanish era serves as a useful guide for those engaged in heritage conservation.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\">Regalado Trota Jose</a></strong></strong>, with additional notes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p><strong>Organizations </strong> are established by architects in order to promote unity and cooperation among themselves and to work for the development and upgrading of the profession and the welfare of its practitioners. The Academia de Arquitectura y Agrimensura de Filipinas, founded in 1902, was the first professional organization for those engaged in the practice of architecture, civil engineering, and surveying. In 1903, it was renamed Academia de Ingenieria, Arquitectura y Agrimensura de Filipinas. It founded the first school of architecture in the Philippines. In 1911, the engineers withdrew to form their own organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the growing number of architects, the Philippine Architects Society was organized in 1933 under the initiative of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\">Juan F. Nakpil</a>. The first officers of the Society were Juan F. Nakpil as president, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a> as vice president, Harold H. Keys as secretary-treasurer, and Sidney D. Rowlands and Fernando Ocampo as directors. Among its early accomplishments were the drafting of its Constitutions and By-Laws, the Rules of Charges and Professional Fees, and the Canon of Ethics of the Society. One of the aims of the Society was to seek the passage of a law that would protect the architectural profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1938, the Society was renamed Philippine Institute of Architects and Planners, and subsequently Philippine Institute of Architects or PIA. In 1946, the PIA held its first annual convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1950, about 15 members left the Institute and formed the League of Philippine Architects or LPA. On 17 Jun 1950, the architectural profession received its first separate statute with the enactment of Republic Act No 545, &ldquo;An Act to Regulate the Practice of Architecture in the Philippines.&rdquo; In 1955, the Boards of the Institute and the League met to discuss the merger of the organizations, but with no result. In 1957, the PIA was admitted as an affiliate organization of the Union Internationale des Architects (UIA). The PIA College of Fellows was created in 1972. In 1958, architects working in the government formed the Association of Philippine Government Architects or APGA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1965, the PIA, LPA, and APGA passed resolutions approving the Architect&rsquo;s National Code and the Architects&rsquo;s Services and Schedule of Fees, which had been prepared by the PIA. Negotiations for the merger of the three organizations continued, but was ultimately fruitless.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Presidential Decree No 233, issued by Ferdinand Marcos in 1973, compelled the three organizations to be integrated as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2705\">United Architects of the Philippines (UAP)</a>. A negotiation panel was formed in May 1973. A 15-member ad hoc Commission was created to prepare the Constitution and By-Laws of UAP as a newly integrated association. On 12 Dec 1974 the Boards of PIA, LPA, and APGA approved the Constitutions and By-Laws of the UAP. In 1975, the Professional Regulation Commission certified the accreditation of the UAP as the only accredited professional organization for architects in the Philippines. An interim board was appointed to administer, implement, and monitor the activities of UAP until such time as a regular Board of Directors and Officers would be elected. There was a total of 1,300 members at the start of the UAP, and 700 more were registered as active members after its first year. On 26 Mar 1976, the UAP was registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The National Regulatory Board listed the UAP as the duly accredited architectural organization for architects in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAP aims to promote the highest standards of ethical conduct and excellence in the practice and service of the architectural profession as well as lifting of the standards of architectural education. The UAP is also committed to unify all registered architects of the Philippines through cooperation and coordination with allied professions, local and international trade and industry, participation in national development programs, and cooperation with the board of architecture and other government agencies. It is willing to render any lawful and appropriate assistance to any of its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 12 Jun 1976, the UAP, which by law had become the only accredited architectural association in the Philippines, informed UIA of the status of all architectural organizations in the country. During the meeting of the UIA Council at Santiago de Chile from 24-26 Jan 1983, UIA passed Resolution No 9, in which UAP legally became the National Section of UIA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UAP is one of the founding members of the Architects Regional Council of Asia (ARCASIA), organized in 1979, which is composed of organizations of architects from Singapore, Malaysia, Hongkong, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines. The first Asian Congress of Architects was sponsored by ARCASIA and held in Manila in Oct 1984. The sixth conference was also held in Manila in Dec 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Currently, UAP is organized into three areas: Area A, comprising northern and central Luzon and Metro Manila with five regional districts; Area B, comprising southern Luzon, the islands of Mindoro, Masbate, and Palawan, with five regional districts; and Area C, comprising the Visayas and Mindanao, with four regional districts. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

It begins with a survey of general works on Philippine architecture, and then deals with the indigenous tradition, Hispanic tradition, American tradition, and their influences and transformations in the contemporary period. Within this broad historical framework, this essay deals with forms and major works associated with the historical period and the architects and builders who were active during the era. Because research is uneven and has many gaps, some sections are shorter than others and not subdivided, but others are.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest in the Philippines is not limited to Filipino scholars but extends to a substantial number of Spanish and Mexican scholars focusing in particular on Philippine colonial architecture of the Hispanic tradition. Specialized publications connected with exhibitions are placed at the end of the relevant section. Grouping the catalogue with a discussion on the exhibit gives it context.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"general\" name=\"general\"></a>General Surveys</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research on Philippine architecture during the first half of the 20th century was understandably limited to architecture strongly influenced by Western tradition. Perhaps, the very first overview of Philippine architecture is found in <strong><em>El Archipielago Filipino</em></strong> (The Philippine Archipelago), a two-volume compendium of facts about the Philippines compiled by the professors and teachers of the Ateneo Municipal de Manila and published in the United States (US) in 1900. These books are extensively quoted, almost verbatim, by the Report to the Philippine Commission of 1901. The section on architecture merely translates passages from <strong><em>El Archipielago</em></strong>. In brief, the section argued that great works of architecture were generally lacking in the Philippines and came only lately to the islands because the era of Spanish colonization corresponded to the era of bad artistic taste in Spain. The architectural section, probably written by Fr. Clotet, SJ, praised the neoclassical and revivalist architecture that had recently appeared in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bias for neoclassicism is reflected in Morilla Maria Norton&rsquo;s <strong><em>Studies in Philippine Architecture</em></strong>, published around 1911, which could only look forward to better times when the US would ameliorate architecture in its new colony. She cites only two distinguished architects of the Spanish era: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>, who created neoclassical and neo-Gothic works; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2661\">Juan Hervas</a>, who, according to Norton, introduced Catalan architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Our Islands and its Peoples</em></strong>, a hefty tome in folio size, was a picture book on the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Hawaii. Written for popular consumption, the book is a survey premised on the attitude that nothing is good unless it comes from the US. A clearly biased account, the book disparages Hispanic architecture in the Philippines and calls all of it medieval and backward. The book had no intention of presenting architectural history; it was a polemical statement intended to bolster America&rsquo;s hold on her colonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very little was written about Philippine architecture during the first half of the 20th century, although articles on churches were published in magazines like <strong><em>Cultura Social</em></strong>. Around 1914, the anti-pornography league of San Francisco published the periodical magazine <strong><em>,</em></strong> and among the articles were surveys of colonial churches, notably those of the Augustinians, and notices of newly built churches. Aside from these, articles about artists and photographic features showing church art were published. The magazine was in Spanish and obviously meant for an older generation, and not for the younger generation, who were educated in the English language. The articles may have been motivated by nostalgia or polemical intent to rebut the insinuations of other writers that nothing of note came out of the Hispanic tradition. While these essays were more historical and religious, rather than architectural, in intent, they still provided information about the architecture of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next survey was published in 1964. Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda, former dean of the College of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines (UP), published <strong><em>Art in the Philippines</em></strong>, a history of Philippine architecture, sculpture, and painting, which traces the development of these arts over the two colonial periods, and the modern period, until the 1960s. Casta&ntilde;eda interviewed a number of the architects mentioned in the book and conducted his research in the Philippine National Archives. Written in a narrative and descriptive fashion, the book aims to present a broad picture of Philippine architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another general survey of Philippine architecture is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2665\">Winand Klassen</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/9/399\"><strong><em>Architecture in the Philippines: Filipino Building in a Cross-Cultural Context</em></strong></a>, 1968. The book posits that architecture mirrors a particular group&rsquo;s quality of life. Klassen adopts the term <strong>vernacular architecture</strong>, rather than folk and indigenous architecture, for structures built by groups based on traditional wisdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video documentaries and monographs on the Philippine arts were prepared by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) under the general title of <strong><em>Tuklas Sining</em></strong> (Discover Art). Introductory in intent, some of the titles in the 28-title series include &ldquo;Arkitektura, An Essay on Philippine Architecture,&rdquo; 1989, by Rodrigo D. Perez III; &ldquo;Philippine Ethnic Architecture,&rdquo; 1992, by Corazon A. Hila; &ldquo;The Spanish Influence on Philippine Architecture,&rdquo; 1992, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\">Regalado Trota Jose</a>; and &ldquo;The American Colonial and Contemporary Traditions in Philippine Architecture,&rdquo; 1994, also by Perez III.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CCP then published the 10-volume <strong><em>CCP Encyclopedia of Philippine Art</em></strong> in 1994, revised and published as a CD-ROM in 1997. Volume 3 was dedicated to architecture. Arranged thematically, the encyclopedia begins with historical and contextual overview essays, including the four previously published separate monographs. Essays on architectural forms, outstanding examples of these forms, and the architects who built many of the important structures complete the encyclopedia. The <strong><em>CCP Encyclopedia</em></strong> set a benchmark on collective knowledge about architecture in the late 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Casta&ntilde;eda, Klassen, and the <strong><em>CCP Encyclopedia</em></strong>, the next comprehensive survey of architecture is by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2668\">Gerard Lico</a> in 2008, titled <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/9/400\"><strong><em>Arkitekturang Filipino: A History of Architecture and Urbanism in the Philippines</em></strong></a>. It is written as a comprehensive textbook for architecture students and is currently used as a general introduction to architecture in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>Indigenous Tradition and Transformation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Study of the indigenous traditions of architecture has been relatively recent, spurred by the nationalist ethos of the 1970s and the move toward Filipinization in the universities. Before the 1970s, studies about indigenous architecture were written in the context of ethnography and anthropology. The return to the Philippine folk and ethnic tradition in architecture was stimulated by the abundance of data on dwellings contained in numerous ethnographic studies in which architecture was studied in the context of a people&rsquo;s life ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest ethnographers, although they did not call themselves so, were the conquistadors and missionaries of the Spanish colonial period, whose duties included sending periodic reports to their superiors. The earliest reports of indigenous dwellings come from Ferdinand Magellan&rsquo;s chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, who in 1521, described at great length the houses he saw in Butuan. Later chroniclers, such as Pedro Chirino, Ignacio Alzina, Pedro Aduarte, and Juan de la Concepci&oacute;n, gave helpful descriptions of indigenous houses, although from a Western viewpoint. The 19th-century <strong><em>Cartas Edificantes</em></strong> of the Jesuit missionaries in Mindanao contain information on the dwellings of the Tiruray, Mandaya, and other indigenous peoples. American interest in ethnographic data arose from curiosity about their new possessions in the tropics. Among the important studies in the early 20th century were written by: Albert E. Jenks, <strong><em>The Bontoc <strong>Igorot</strong></em></strong>, 1904; Fay-Cooper Cole, <strong><em>The Wild Tribes of Davao District, Mindanao</em></strong>, 1913; and John M. Garvan, <strong><em>The Manobos of Mindanao</em></strong>, 1931.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1929, Fr Francis M. Lambrecht, a Belgian missionary in the Cordilleras, published <strong><em><strong>Ifugao</strong> Villages and Houses</em></strong>, a work which is significant for its thoroughness. William Henry Scott&rsquo;s <strong><em>Cordillera Architecture in Northern Luzon</em></strong> was published in 1962, and proposed classifications of Cordillera houses into what he called the northern and southern strains. Studies on the different groups in the Cordillera include: Morice Vanoverbergh, &ldquo;Isneg Buildings,&rdquo; 1953; Moises C. Bello, &ldquo;Some Notes on House Styles in a Kankanai Village,&rdquo; 1963; Edward P. Dozier, <strong><em>The Kalinga of Northern Luzon</em></strong>, 1967; Carmencita Cawed, <strong><em>The Culture of the Bontoc Igorots</em></strong>, 1972; and Kate Botengan, <strong><em>Bontoc Lifeways</em></strong>, 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish scholarship on the indigenous tradition is found in the section on architecture in <strong><em>Arte Indigena del Norte de Filipinas, Los Grupos Etnicos de la Cordillera de Luzon</em></strong> (Indigenous Art of the Northern Philippines, the Ethnic Groups of the Cordillera of Luzon), published in 2012, which updates William Henry Scott&rsquo;s 1962 article. The appendix contains transcriptions of some of the earliest Spanish accounts on the peoples of the Cordillera from 1576 to 1624, drawn from the Archivo General de Indias in Seville.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other ethnographic studies on Luzon groups, which usually contained descriptions of dwelling and settlement patterns are: Lawrence L. Wilson, <strong><em>Ilongot Life and Legends</em></strong>, 1967; Ponciano L. Bennagen, &ldquo;The Agta,&rdquo; 1969; Marcelino N. Maceda, &ldquo;A Brief Report on Some Mangyans in Northern Oriental Mindoro,&rdquo; 1964; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5384\">Florentino H. Hornedo</a>, &ldquo;The Traditional Ivatan House,&rdquo; 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies on the Mindanao groups include: Jesus T. Peralta, &ldquo;The Maranao,&rdquo; 1969; Turan Ikiali Jainal, G. Rixhon, and D. Rupert, &ldquo;Housebuilding among the Tausug&rdquo;, 1972; Harry Arlo Nimmo, <strong><em>The Sea People of Sulu: A Study of Social Change in the Philippines</em></strong>, 1972; Nagasura Madale, &ldquo;A Look at Philippine Mosques,&rdquo; Salam, 1976; Cesar Adib Majul, &ldquo; Mosques in the Philippines,&rdquo; 1977; and Gabriel S. Casal, <strong><em>Tboli Art in Its Socio-Cultural Context</em></strong>, 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies on prehispanic settlements and dwellings based on archaeology include Robert B. Fox&rsquo;s &ldquo;Looking at the Prehispanic Community,&rdquo; 1977, and Karl Hutterer&rsquo;s <strong><em>An Archaeological Picture of a Pre-Spanish Cebuano Community</em></strong>, 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surveys of folk and indigeous architecture include: Julian Dacanay Jr, <strong><em>Ethnic Houses and Philippine Artistic Expression</em></strong>,1988; Felipe M. de Leon Jr, &ldquo;The Architecture of the Philippines: A Survey&rdquo; from <strong><em>Philippine Art and Literature</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Filipino Nation</em></strong>, Vol III, 1982; and <strong><em>Folk Architecture</em></strong> by Rodrigo D. Perez III, Rosario S. Encarnacion, and Julian E. Dacanay Jr, published in 1989, then probably the most comprehensive and best illustrated scholarly survey of Philippine indigenous houses from the Cordilleras to the Visayas to Sulu and Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest in folk and indigenous architecture was promoted by the CCP&rsquo;s traveling exhibit titled &ldquo;Balai Vernacular.&rdquo; Based on documentations made by architecture students from all over the islands, the exhibit documented three types of shelters: the indigenous house, the bahay kubo, and the shanty. Corazon Hila, Julian Dacanay Jr, and Rodrigo Perez III synthesized the findings of the exhibit in the book <strong><em>Balai Vernacular: Images of the Filipino&rsquo;s Private Space</em></strong>, 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999, Abraham Sakili wrote a thesis submitted to UP titled &ldquo;The Concept of Space and the Islamic Spatial Expression in the Traditional Architecture and Visual Arts of The Philippines,&rdquo; which was the basis for his book, <strong><em>Space and Identity: Expressions in the Culture, Arts and Society of the Muslims in the Philippines</em></strong> published by the UP Asian Center in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>Hispanic Tradition and Transformation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish colonial era has by far received the most scholarly attention, judging from the number of books and articles about this period when the traditions of East and West met in the Philippines. Studies have been made, not just by Philippine scholars, but also by those based in Spain and Mexico. These works may be divided into general surveys and those that focus on a topic with some depth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>General Works.</strong> A remarkable project was that of the Spanish scholar Mar&iacute;a Lourdes D&iacute;az-Trechuelo Sp&iacute;nola, who combed the Spanish archives for material for her doctoral dissertation on Hispanic architecture in the Philippines. Published in 1959, <strong><em>Arquitectura Espa&ntilde;ola en Filipinas</em></strong><strong><em>(1565&ndash;1800)</em></strong> surpassed in scope all the research done in the Philippines up to that time. Diaz-Trechuelo&rsquo;s work encompassed church, civil, and military architecture, and is notable for its study of fortifications. While enjoying access to a vast amount of important documents, the author did not have the benefit of fieldwork in the Philippines. Her careful historiography, made possible by the Spanish colonial bureaucracy&rsquo;s obsessive thoroughness in documenting its work, succeeded in creating a picture of the many buildings demolished by war and calamities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another scholar, Pedro Ortiz Armengol, was an ambassador to the Philippines who took great interest in Intramuros, combining archival research and fieldwork. <strong><em>Intramuros de Manila</em></strong>, published in 1958, was generously illustrated with photographs and line drawings of buildings, and was based on an 18th century map of Intramuros. However, after these scholarly works, more than a decade was to pass before Spanish scholars would &ldquo;rediscover&rdquo; Philippine architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following these pioneers are early exploratory surveys. In 1968, Emilio Gomez Pi&ntilde;ol embarked on a photographic journey all over the islands. The number of pictures of colonial buildings taken was comparable to that of the American Richard Ahlborn, who roamed the countryside some 10 years earlier. Gomez Pi&ntilde;ol&rsquo;s boxes of photographs were kept in the Universidad de Sevilla, but since his retirement their location is unknown. Gomez Pi&ntilde;ol also produced a pioneering study, comparing Indo-Portuguese art with Hispano-Filipino art entitled <strong><em>Aspectos Generales de la Relacion Entre el Arte Indo-portugues y el Hispano-Filipino</em></strong> (General Aspects of the Relationship Between Indo-Portuguese and Hispano-Filipino Art), published in 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Gomez Pi&ntilde;ol, Indo-Portuguese architecture was characterized by strong Renaissance and Mannerist lines brought by Portuguese architects, but bearing Hindu, African, and even Mongol influences. The Golden Age of this art extends from 1510&mdash;the conquest of Goa, India by the Portuguese&mdash;to 1759, with the abandonment of Goa for better conditions in Panjim. Hispano-Filipino architecture, by comparison, may be said to have developed its own identity by mid-18th century when Hispanization had begun to take root. Gomez Pi&ntilde;ol argues for the originality of Hispano-Filipino art, which incorporated influences from the indigenous, Spanish, Chinese, and Mexican cultures. He points out the tendency of facades to be composed of proportions of squares, an aspect explored more fully by Santiago Porras in 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arte en America y Filipinas</em></strong> (Art in America and the Philippines) published in 1973 by the eminent art historian Enrique Marco Dorta formed a volume of the encyclopedia <strong><em>Ars Hispaniae</em></strong> (Art of Spain). The short chapter on Philippine art included general comments on Intramuros, the Augustinian churches of Iloilo and Ilocos, the houses of Bustos, Bulacan, and the 19th century revival styles. Marco Dorta&rsquo;s opinions were informed by notes from his student Emilio Gomez Pi&ntilde;ol, who in 1974 in turn inherited his mentor&rsquo;s post as Catedratico de Historia del Arte Hispanoamericano of the Universidad de Sevilla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another book, which describes Manila&rsquo;s important public buildings, specifically the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\">Aduana</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/364\">Puente de Espa&ntilde;a</a>, is <strong><em>Arquitectura y Urbanismo en el Siglo XIX</em></strong> (Architecture and Urbanism in the 19th Century) by Fr Luis Merino, OSA, published in 1967. The book reproduced important documents relating to the planning, building, renovation, and maintenance of these structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Pal Kelemen, a Hungarian historian of baroque and rococo art, wrote on the Philippines without ever leaving his adopted country, Mexico. In <strong><em>Art of the Americas: Ancient and Hispanic, with a Comparative Chapter on the Philippines</em></strong>, published in 1969, Kelemen observed that a thorough and careful study of Hispanic architecture in the Philippines was needed and would yield unexpected results. It was Kelemen who coined the phrase &ldquo;earthquake baroque&rdquo; to describe squat churches, particularly those in Peru. The term was adopted with great care by scholars, but was used with great abandon by the populace. Scholarly appreciation of the particular adaptation of baroque was evident in the works of this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fr Luis Merino, an Augustinian based in San Agustin, Intramuros, produced two volumes of pioneering studies that touched on aspects of architecture during Spanish-period Manila: <strong><em>Estudios sobre el Municipio de Manila</em></strong> (Studies on the Municipality of Manila), published in 1983 and 1987. He posited that the chief of the building of Intramuros&rsquo;s stone walls, Pedro Jusepe, was a Filipino. Other detailed essays dealt with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\">Ayuntamiento</a>, the Aduana, the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a, construction expenses, the Corps of Military Engineers, and the Earthquake Ordinances of 1880. A further two volumes, with articles on the Botanical Gardens, the electrification of Manila, the Carriedo fountain, firefighting, the urbanization of barrio San Nicolas, and the penitentiary system, unfortunately did not see the light. The Intramuros Administration posthumously named its library after Fr Merino.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Three decades after Maria Lourdes Diaz-Trechuelo Spinola&rsquo;s 1959 dissertation <strong><em>Arquitectura Espa&ntilde;ola en Filipinas</em></strong>, Santiago Porras Alvarez finished his doctoral dissertation, <strong><em>Asian Baroque: A Study on the Interaction Between the Iberian Baroque and the Native Cultures in South East Asia</em></strong>, in 1991. In two ways it characterized the broadening character of Spanish academia. It was written in English, and it was produced in the University of Tokyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a database that included files for 104 structures and 75 measured drawings of colonial structures, mostly churches, in the Philippines, Porras was able to draw up a few hypotheses. Church plans and facades were drawn from modules of one<em>braza</em>by one<em>braza</em>, or about six feet squared. A study of the manual prepared by Fr Juan Albarran for the Santo Ni&ntilde;o church in Cebu reveals that many churches were built along the proportions propounded in the manual. Each region had its manner of varying these proportions. A summary of Porras&rsquo;s findings, presented in a conference in Valladolid in 1996, was published in 1999.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\">Doreen G. Fernandez</a> and Jose M. Cruz&rsquo;s <em>The World of 1896</em>, published 1998, has an essay on the status of architecture at the turn of the 19th century. In 1998, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a> edited <strong><em>Igkas Arte: The Philippine Arts during the Spanish Period</em></strong>, which included an analytical and historical survey of architecture of the Spanish era by Rodrigo D. Perez III.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2002, an international conference was held in Manila under the auspices of Instituto Cervantes. International speakers were asked to address the theme of Fil-Hispanic architecture in the Philippines. The papers read at the conference were edited by Javier Galvan, who also participated in the conference. The proceedings were published as <strong><em>Endangered: Fil-Hispanic Architecture</em></strong> in 2005. Both the conference and the papers read discussed the appropriateness of using Hispanic rather than Spanish architecture to describe Philippine architecture from the late 16th to the 19th century. Characteristics of Filipinized Hispanic architecture were also discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_7\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Some 13 years after Porras&rsquo;s dissertation, Javier Galvan Guijo completed his <strong><em>Arquitectura y Urbanismo de Origen Espa&ntilde;ol en el Pacifico Occidental</em></strong> (Architecture and Urbanism of Spanish Origin in the Western Pacific) in 2004. This doctoral dissertation earned Galvan the degree of Doctor Arquitecto from the Escuela Tecnica Superior de Arquitectura of the Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. The three volumes are the maturation of his earlier works, complemented by his being Director of the Instituto Cervantes in Manila from 2001 to 2006. The modern Fil-Hispanic building of the Instituto along T.M. Kalaw Street in Manila was designed by Galvan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first volume is a summation of Galvan&rsquo;s observations and analyses of Philippine architecture during the Spanish period. Published versions of these, titled collectively as <strong><em>Manila, Occidente en Oriente</em></strong> (Manila, West in the East), appeared in 1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, and 2004. The second volume of Galvan&rsquo;s dissertation, developed from a study published in 2001, is an in-depth analysis of the churches in the Cagayan Valley while the third volume deals with Hispanic architecture in Guam and other former Spanish possessions in the Pacific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Galvan notes the irony that although Spanish researchers wrote about Philippine architecture through archival documents but without seeing the structures firsthand, the opposite was true for Filipino scholars. Thus Galvan illustrates his discussion on &ldquo;Arquitectura Filhispana&rdquo; with examples and images from his extensive trips throughout the Philippines. In fact, he proposes that the church complexes built during the Spanish era, with all their influences and techniques, are the most emblematic of Philippine architectural patrimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He finds that what is &ldquo;miraculous&rdquo; in San Agustin church is not necessarily its survival to this day, but its plan. The stone church begun in 1591 is a rectangle enclosing a cruciform flanked by side altars, quite similar to the revolutionary one of Vignola for Il Ges&uacute; in Rome, consecrated only seven years before in 1584. A significant chapter deals with gems of architecture in Intramuros and its environs that have since disappeared. A section on the possible sources of the octagonal form in Fil-hispanic architecture (Spanish, Mexican, Islamic, Chinese) was developed from a talk that Galvan presented in a conference in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Forms and Types.</strong> The international academic portrayal of Philippine colonial architecture as a land of churches and forts was expanded by a number of contributions on other forms, like hospitals, <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (stone house), lighthouses, and bridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Churches and Conventos.</strong> Before World War II, studies on churches had already been published. In 1937, Raymundo C. Ba&ntilde;as published <strong><em>Brief <strong>Historical</strong> Sketches of Philippine Catholic Churches</em></strong>, in time for the celebration of the 33rd International Eucharistic Congress held in Manila that year. This book is the earliest survey of colonial churches. It presents data, which are more historical than architectural, on famous churches, such as the churches of pre-World War II Intramuros and the churches of Santa Ana, Ermita, Binondo, Santa Cruz, Sampaloc, San Sebastian, Pandacan, Malate, Paco, Quiapo, and San Miguel in the Manila area, as well as Obando, Maasin, and Cebu outside Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_8\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>William C. Repetti&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pictorial Records and Traces of the Society of Jesus in the Philippine Islands and Guam Prior to 1768</em></strong> was published in 1938 by the archivist of the Jesuit mission in the Philippines. The book was the result of attempts to add to the data of the archives. The author was assisted by Brother Dunne and Father Gissel, who took most of the photographs. In response to his letters, parish priests in the towns formerly under the Jesuit order sent him information as well as photographs of the churches. Repetti, however, was merely content with cataloguing and notating the pictures he compiled. Some notes are inaccurate, as subsequent research proved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, more architectural publications were produced. A similar survey of churches was done by Fr Jose Ma. Gonzalez in his <strong><em>Labor Evangelica y Civilizadora de los Religiosos Dominicos en Pangasinan</em></strong> (Evangelical and Civilizing Work of the Dominican Religious in Pangasinan). Published in 1946, it gave historical data on the parishes, churches, conventos, and public buildings of Pangasinan, and describes them in the context of the evangelization of the province. Visitacion de la Torre published <strong><em>Faith Enshrined: Churches of Pangasinan</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the war also reduced the numerous architectural monuments of the Spanish and American periods. With such widespread destruction, there was very little architectural history written for many years. Instead, collectors and avid nationalists sought to salvage what was left of the past. From these practices, there developed a reassessment of the colonial heritage. During the first half of the century, Philippine architecture was evaluated from the viewpoint of the West. Measured by Western standards, such as John Ruskin&rsquo;s, Philippine architecture seemed nothing more than a poor offshoot of European architecture. Soon the writers of the 1950s began to take local architecture on its own terms. Not unfamiliar with Western architecture, they had the advantage of being Filipinos or of spending much of their lives in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first structures to be reevaluated were the colonial churches. Questioning the assumption that colonial churches were derivative in form and ornament, Benito Legarda, Fernando Zobel de Ayala, and others sought to document what was left of these structures after the devastation of war. The result of their excursions to the provinces in the late 1950s was the publication of Legarda&rsquo;s &ldquo;Colonial Churches of Ilocos&rdquo; in <strong><em>Philippine Studies</em></strong>, and by Zobel on the <strong>santo</strong>, an integral element of colonial architecture. Zobel&rsquo;s article was to be expanded into a book, <strong><em>Philippine Religious Imagery</em></strong>, published in 1963, which contained a section on the Philippine <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (stone house) and drew parallels between architectural and sculptural styles. Legarda continued his research on northern Luzon churches and in 1981 published &ldquo;Angels in Clay: The Typical Cagayan Church Style&rdquo; in the <strong><em>Filipinas Journal 2</em></strong>. Legarda also posed the question whether there might be regional styles, and set out to prove this in a study of the Cagayan churches. Zobel&rsquo;s study on the santo proposed stylistic categories, such as popular, classical, and ornate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Richard Ahlborn, an American, published two articles in <strong><em>Philippine Studies</em></strong> from 1960 to 1963 on the churches of central Luzon, notably those of Rizal and Bulacan. An overview and interpretative study appeared two years earlier, in the <strong><em>Exchange News Quarterly</em></strong> in 1958. Ahlborn returned to the US and worked with the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC, where his collection of photographs of churches was kept in his office. Since his death, the collection has been bequeathed to Tulane University&rsquo;s Latin American Library in Howard-Tilton Memorial University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972, Alicia Marquez Lim-Coseteng published <strong><em>Spanish Churches in the Philippines</em></strong> under the auspices of UNESCO and its National Commission in the Philippines. While viewing colonial churches in the context of the strategies of evangelization and colonial control, Lim-Coseteng analyzed their architectural features and cites their artistic value. However, no major survey of colonial churches appeared until Fr Pedro Galende published his book on Augustinian churches, <strong><em>Angels in Stone</em></strong>, in 1987, which was republished in a new format with colored pictures in 2000. The author had access to many sources in the Augustinian archives and succeeded in documenting the historical setting, growth, and development of each church. The book is limited to churches held solely by Augustinians. Churches that were transferred to the jurisdiction of another group, like the Franciscans, are excluded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another researcher, Florentino Hornedo, specialized in the churches of the Cagayan Valley and the Batanes Islands. He has published articles on the evangelizing work of the Dominicans and on the churches and their friar builders. His works have appeared in popular magazines and in the scholarly journals of the University of Santo Tomas. His essays include &ldquo;Religious Art in Batanes&rdquo; in 1983 and &ldquo;The Tumauini Church: Praise of 100&quot;&gt;<strong>Subli</strong>me Labor in Clay&rdquo; in 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1991, Norma I. Alarcon published <strong><em>Philippine Architecture during the Pre-Spanish and Spanish Period</em></strong>, a broad textbook survey of architecture in the Philippines, both public and private, in the indigenous and Hispanic traditions. The biggest section of the book is devoted to Spanish period churches, whose history and characteristic architectural features are listed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More works on colonial churches are Regalado Trota Jose&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Simbahan</strong></em></strong> and Ren&eacute; B. Javellana&rsquo;s <strong><em>Wood and Stone for God&rsquo;s Greater Glory</em></strong>, both published in 1991. The former is a catalogue and survey of colonial churches from Batanes to Jolo. Intended as an aid for the documentation of churches, the text describes a colonial church in great detail. Trota Jose has done fieldwork all over the islands and used archival documents from local repositories extensively. Javellana&rsquo;s book is a historical summary and catalogue of the Jesuit order&rsquo;s building enterprise over two periods: 1581 to 1768, and 1859 to World War II. The book uses material from both local and foreign archives and fieldwork to piece together the story of the Jesuits&rsquo; contribution to Philippine art and architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2002, Hornedo published <strong><em>On the Trail of Dominican Engineers, Artists and Saints in the Cagayan Valley and Batanes</em></strong> which brought together his research on the Dominicans&rsquo;s architectural activities. In 2003, Maria Teresa Padilla Quevedo submitted a thesis to UP entitled &ldquo;The Theory and Framework of Mission Architecture of Ituy and Paniqui.&rdquo; In 2008, Romero B. Galang Jr submitted a thesis to UP entitled &ldquo;A Cultural History of the Santo Domingo Ecclesiastical Complex in Intramuros, Manila: 1587-1900.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2010, Javellana&rsquo;s <strong><em>La Casa de Dios: The Legacy of Filipino-Hispanic Architecture</em></strong> was published as a historical introduction to colonial churches, based on the photographic collection of the Ortigas Foundation. The book was the foundation for an exhibit on colonial churches titled &ldquo;Los Vinculos Duraderos con Espa&ntilde;a: Las Iglesias de Filipinas&rdquo; (Lasting Links with Spain: the Churches of the Philippines), which opened at the Casa Am&eacute;rica located at the Palacio Linares in Madrid on 28 Nov 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the studies listed above had the common purpose of discovering and identifying the distinctly Philippine features of colonial churches. For countless years they were called &ldquo;Spanish churches,&rdquo; but decades of research have shown that they had many non-Spanish elements that had not been previously recognized. Calling them Philippine churches is not only nationalistically sound but architecturally accurate. <strong><em>Philippine Churches</em></strong>, the popular coffee table book published by the National Media Production Center in 1980, makes this point clearly. But beginning in 2002, during the international conference on Fil-Hispanic architecture, scholars began favoring the term &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; to describe these churches. Javellana argues in <strong><em>La Casa de Dios</em></strong> that the influences and sources of Philippine colonial architecture are more precisely termed Hispanic rather than Spanish because influences on architecture are also derived from Mexico and Peru.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Balaanong Bahandi: Sacred Treasures of Cebu</em></strong> by J. Eleazar Bersales, which was published by the Cathedral Museum of Cebu and San Carlos University Press in 2010, is about the colonial churches of Cebu. Historical data was culled from the 1886 <strong><em>Breve Rese&ntilde;a de lo que Fue y de lo que Es la Diocesis de Cebu</em></strong> (A Brief Review of the Past and Present of the Diocese of Cebu) by Father Felipe Redondo y Sendino, but updated by its authors. Intended to complement the book on Cebu was a work on Bohol churches, but the earthquake of Oct 2013 damaged so many structures that it was impossible to study them. The book was redesigned to show the effects of the earthquake by juxtaposing before and after photographs. Authored by Bersales, with photographs by Fr Generoso Rebalya, SVD and Estan Cabigas, the book was titled <strong><em>Pagsulay: Churches of Bohol Before and after the Earthquake of 2013</em></strong>, and published by San Carlos Press. Similarly, Regalado Trota Jose&rsquo;s works on Fil-Hispanic churches, amply documented with photographs, was included in a series in <strong><em>Philippiniana Sacra</em></strong>, a journal published by the University of Santo Tomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To date, Pedro Luengo Gutierrez is the most productive researcher in the field of Spanish scholarship; not only on Fil-Hispanic architecture but on Fil-Hispanic arts in general. This capacity for research must be credited to the tradition of scholarship at the Department of Art History in the Universidad de Sevilla. Luengo&rsquo;s first work on Fil-Hispanic architecture is <strong><em>Arquitectura Conventual en Manila 1571-1645</em></strong> (Conventual Architecture in Manila 1571-1645), which earned him a Diploma in Advanced Studies in 2008 from the Universidad de Sevilla. It deals with the churches and institutions of the religious orders in Intramuros from the founding of Manila in 1571 until the disastrous earthquake of 1645.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arquitectura Conventual</em></strong> was followed by Luengo&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation <strong><em>Intramuros: Arquitectura en Manila 1739-1762</em></strong> in 2010, which was published in 2012. Tracing the building of such emblematic structures as the Franciscan Church and Convent, the Cathedral, and the Alcaiceria de San Fernando led Luengo to single out the decade from 1750 to 1760 as one of the most brilliant in the history of Philippine architecture. The data that Luengo obtained was enough to produce another book, which became <strong><em>Manila, Plaza Fuerte (1762-1788)</em></strong>, published in 2013. This third volume expands the contributions of military engineers beyond fortifications to include churches and civil structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fortifications.</strong> A version of Fernando Valdes Tamon&rsquo;s 1738<em>relacion</em>translated as <strong><em>Report in Which, By Order of His Catholic Majesty &hellip; the Strongholds, Castles, Forts and Garrisons of the Provinces Under His Royal Protection in the Philippine Islands Are Listed</em></strong> was published in 1995. It was a transcription and translation of a report submitted to the Spanish king about the status of Philippine fortifications. It contains reproductions of the plans that accompanied the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Javellana&rsquo;s <strong><em>Fortress of Empire: Spanish Colonial Fortifications of the Philippines, 1565-1898</em></strong> in 1997, is the first published study on colonial fortifications in the Philippines. This was complemented by an unpublished eight-volume documentation on fortifications made for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> in 2008. Part of the data in that report has been published online, in a website called <strong><em>Muog</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospitals<em>.</em></strong> Spanish scholar Juan Antonio Casero Nieto specialized in the history of hospitals in the Philippines. His licensure thesis was on hospitals founded by the Franciscans, called &ldquo;Hospitales Fundados por los Franciscanos Espa&ntilde;oles en Filipinas, entre 1578-1898&rdquo; (Hospitals Founded by the Spanish Franciscans in the Philippines between 1578 and 1898), while his doctoral dissertation was on the organization of hospitals during the Spanish period, titled &ldquo;La Organizacion Hospitalaria en Filipinas Durante la Colonizacion Espa&ntilde;ola&rdquo; (The Hospital Organizations in the Philippines During the Spanish Colonization). The data in these works were integrated in a hefty study on hospitals in Spanish America and the Philippines by Francisco Guerra, titled <strong><em>El Hospital en Hispanoamerica y Filipinas 1492-1898</em></strong> (The Hospital in Spanish America and the Philippines, 1492-1898), published in 1994. A total of 96 Philippine institutions was listed and described, ranging from hospitals to infirmaries and from leprosaria to hospices. Guerra was not only a medical doctor, but also held doctorate degrees in science, history and philosophy. Finally, Fr Cayetano Sanchez Fuertes, a Franciscan archivist in Madrid, wrote &ldquo;Hospitales y Enfermerias de los Franciscanos en Extremo Oriente&rdquo; (Franciscan hospitals and infirmaries in the Far East) and &ldquo;El hospital Franciscano de los Naturales de Filipinas, siglos xvi-xvii&rdquo; (The Franciscan Hospital of the Natives of the Philippines, 16th and 17th centuries), rounding out the research done on hospital architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Infrastructure.</strong> Other scholars turned their attention to engineering and public works. In 1992, Ignacio Gonzalez Tascon&rsquo;s hefty two-volume work, <strong><em>Ingenieria Espa&ntilde;ola en Ultramar: Siglos XVI-XIX</em></strong> (Spanish Engineering Overseas, 16th-19th centuries), was published in Madrid by the College of Engineers of Roads, Canals, and Ports. The section on the Philippines deals with the building of bridges, dams, and waterways, with emphasis on the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a and the Carriedo waterworks. It is well illustrated with archival drawings, plans, and photographs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Launched in 1992, Miguel Angel Sanchez Terry&rsquo;s <strong><em>Faros Espa&ntilde;oles de Ultramar</em></strong> (Spanish Lighthouses Overseas) was published by Spain&rsquo;s Ministry of Public Works and Transport. For the Philippines, 40 large and small lighthouses are described, along with 14 others that were planned but not completed. Each of the 54 structures&mdash;from Aparri to Jolo&mdash;is presented with a building history, technical specifications, location map, plans, and photographs. The maps and plans and most of the photographs are taken from archival sources. The author&rsquo;s great-grandfather was a port captain in Manila in the late 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other notable works include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2685\">Manuel Noche</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Lonely Sentinels of the Sea: the Spanish Lighthouses in the Philippines</em></strong>, published in 2005. It is about 19th century lighthouses and contains archival and recent photographs of these lighthouses. His second book <strong><em>Puentes de Espa&ntilde;a en las Filipinas: The Spanish Colonial Bridges of the Philippines</em></strong>, focuses on the much forgotten legacy of the Spanish era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Naval Engineering.</strong> Jesus Garcia del Valle Gomez&rsquo;s <strong><em>Retrato de un Navio. Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar de Zaragoza de la Carrera Manila-Acapulco (1733-1750)</em></strong> (Portrait of a Ship: Our Lady of the Pillar of Zaragoza, of the Manila-Acapulco Route, 1733-1750), published in 1993, is an excellent source for Philippine naval architecture, using the ship baptized<em>Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar de Zaragoza</em>as its primary example. Built in the Cavite shipyards, the<em>Pilar</em>disappeared in 1750 while traversing the Pacific Ocean on its fifth voyage to Acapulco. The author, an engineer and naval historian, distinguishes among certain types of ocean-going vessels all known as galleons. The<em>galeon</em>was prevalent in the 17th century but the last of its type built in the Philippines was in 1718. It was supplanted by the more complex ship called the<em>navio</em>. A smaller version of the navio used often as a patrol ship was the<em>patache</em>; this latter ship and its cousin the<em>fragata</em>(frigate) replaced the navio in the latter years of the Manila-Acapulco Trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sanchez Terry, Noche, and Valle Gomez&rsquo;s works point to the key role that the Manila-Acapulco trade played in the development of the Philippines. In particular, the cultural trade that occurred during the Manila-Acapulco trade was of interest to Ana Ruiz Gutierrez, a professor of art history at the Universidad de Granada. A specialist on Fil-Hispanic art, her <strong><em>El Trafico Artistico entre Espa&ntilde;a y Filipinas (1565-1815)</em></strong> (The Artistic Exchange Between Spain and the Philippines, 1565-1815), published 2005, deals with the exchange of artistic goods between Spain and the Philippines during the Galleon Trade, which lasted from 1565 to 1815.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In line with this transnational exchange are the works of Mexican scholars. A doctor and architect teaching at the Universidad de Colima, Adolfo Gomez Amador has pointed to the <strong>palapa</strong>, the native hut on the western coast of Mexico, as a structure influenced by Filipino architecture. Filipinos who arrived on Mexican soil brought with them the coconut palm, the process of making coconut wine or<em>tuba</em>, and the technique of using the coconut leaf, the<em>palapa</em>, as roofing material. Gomez Amador&rsquo;s findings, first published in 2000 and 2001, were refined in 2014 &ldquo;Palapa: Una Tecnologia que Trajo el Galeon de Manila&rdquo; (Palapa: a Technology Brought by the Manila Galleon). Additional confirmation for Gomez would be the town of Palapag in Northern Samar, an important Philippine port along the Manila-Acapulco route, and the Tagalog word<em>palapag</em>, which means a level in a house, or a temporary platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Juan B. Artigas, the palapa, or palm roof in Mexico, is derived from the Tagalog <strong>palapala</strong>, or a shed of light materials. An architectural historian, Artigas points this out as one aspect linking the barely studied fields of Mexican and Philippine architecture. In his <strong><em>Arquitectura a Cielo Abierto en Iberoamerica Como un Invariante Continental</em></strong> (Open-Air Architecture in Iberoamerica as a Continental Invariable Characteristic), published 2008, Artigas cites the wide atriums in front of Philippine churches, regularly marked by Stations of the Cross or <strong>capillas posas</strong> (small outdoor oratories) as evidence of the shared Ibero-American heritage of open-air architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a short paper delivered in Manila in 2006 and published in 2010, the architect Jorge Loyzaga pointed out that the large <strong>atrio</strong> found in front of many churches was found only in Mexico and the Philippines. In his &ldquo;La Arquitectura Filipina Durante el Virreinato Novohispano y las Influencias que Llegaron al Archipelago&rdquo; (Philippine Architecture during the Viceroyalty of New Spain and the Influences that Reached the Archipelago), Loyzaga emphasized that the basic origin of Spanish colonial architecture in the Philippines was not from Spain, but from Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>Bahay na Bato</strong></a>.</strong> The search for Philippine architecture led to a serious study of the bahay na bato. Unsurpassed in scope and depth is Fernando Zialcita and Martin Tinio Jr&rsquo;s <strong><em>Philippine Ancestral Houses</em></strong>, published in 1980, which documents the evolution of the bahay na bato from the 1810s to the 1930s. The bahay na bato is dissected from a structural point of view and is shown to have incorporated design concepts from the <strong>bahay kubo</strong>, the traditional nipa hut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raquel Baltazar-Florendo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Las Casas Bajo de la Campanas: A Socio-cultural Approach to the Study of Interior Spaces of Principalia Dwellings in Vigan Ilocos Sur, 1800-1900&rdquo; was published as <strong><em>Las Casas Bajo de la Campanas</em></strong> in 2012. An important study of a particular bahay na bato in Cebu&rsquo;s Parian, which situates and explains important structures in its sociohistorical context, is <strong><em><strong>Casa Gorordo</strong> in Cebu, Urban Residence in a Philippine Province</em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5517\">Resil B. Mojares</a>. Commissioned by the Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc in 1983, the study relates the Gorordo residence to the urbanization of Cebu in the 19th century. In other parts of the Visayas, <strong><em>Casa Boholana: <strong>Vinta</strong>ge Houses of Bohol</em></strong> by Erik Akpedonu and Czarina Saloma, published in 2013 by the Ateneo de Manila University Press, records the many bahay na bato from the 19th century that have been preserved in Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Major Works.</strong> In addition to the general works and the works on specific genres of Hispanic structures in the Philippines, there have been studies on specific buildings or sites in this tradition. Arts professor Marilyn Canta completed her masters thesis at the UP in 1990, &ldquo;An Architectural History of the Churches of Camarines Sur, 1578-1898,&rdquo; an area evangelized by the Franciscans, beginning with its pioneers Frs Juan de Plasencia and Diego de Oropesa, OFM. That same year, another thesis in UP that focused on specific architectural histories were Honey Libertine R. Achanzar&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Philippine Kampana: Its Sonic and Non-Sonic Meaning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1995, Marie Joy Buendia Rosal submitted &ldquo;An Art Historical Study of Spanish Period Stone Cemeteries in Iloilo.&rdquo; Marta Manchado Lopez wrote &ldquo;El Proyecto de Convento Para Mestizas de Santa Rosa de Lima, en Filipinas&rdquo; (The Proposed Convent for Mestizas of Santa Rosa de Lima in the Philippines) in 1999, regarding the unsuccessful project to build a convento for the daughters of Filipina mothers and Chinese fathers in Binondo, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1993, Frs Jose Maria Martinez and Nicolas Salvatierra, OAR wrote, &ldquo;The Basilica of San Sebastian.&rdquo; In 1994, Evelyn Vergara submitted to UP a thesis entitled &ldquo;The Manila Cathedral, 1571-1896: An Architectural History.&rdquo; Rupert Santos, former archivist of the Archdiocese of Manila, published a monograph, <strong><em>Manila Cathedral, Minor Basilica of the Immaculate Conception</em></strong>, 1997, illustrated with plans and photographs from the Roman Catholic Archives of Manila. Alfredo J. Morales&rsquo;s &ldquo;Una Catedral para Manila&rdquo; (A Cathedral for Manila), 2003, described the process of building the Manila Cathedral in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regalado Trota Jose&rsquo;s <strong><em>Visita Iglesia Bohol: A Guide to Historic Churches</em></strong> was published by the NCCA. Similarly, the Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc. has published a guide to the heritage sites of Argao, Cebu, many of which are from the Spanish colonial era, like the church complex, the enclosed patio with its capillas posas, the municipal hall, remnants of defensive wall and its gate, a mortuary, and several bahay na bato, the oldest of which is behind the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999, Lorelei D. Del Castillo submitted to UP &ldquo;A History of Architecture in Binondo, 1594-1898: A Socio-cultural Study of the Architecture of Binondo.&rdquo; This became the basis for a history of architecture in Binondo which was published in 2001 by the UST Press as <strong><em>Three Centuries of Binondo Architecture 1594-1898: A Socio-historical Perspective</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul Gershwiler&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bolhoon: A Cultural Sketch</em></strong>, 2009, is about the town of Bolhoon in Cebu. The heart of this town is the Church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Patrocinio. <strong><em>Bolhoon</em></strong> is an example of town history that adds to an understanding and appreciation of the Hispanic tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ren&eacute; B. Javellana&rsquo;s <strong><em>In &amp; Around Intramuros: An Interactive Guide</em></strong> in 2003 offers five schemes for a walking tour of the walled city of Intramuros. Each tour allows for a sampling of the urban and architectural features of this historic city. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">Ramon Ma. Zaragoza</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Villa Fernandina, Ilocos Sur</em></strong>, published in 2004, is a pictorial history of Vigan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruce Leonard Fenner&rsquo;s <strong><em>Cebu Under the Spanish Flag, 1521-1896: An Economic and Social History</em></strong>, was first published in 1985, and reprinted in 2004 by the University of San Carlos. While not directly about architecture, it gives the context for the rise and decline of Cebu, especially the Parian, which was the residence of the entrepreneurial Cebuano mestizos who left behind many heritage bahay na bato like Casa Gorordo and the Yap-San Diego House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An uncommon topic on the Spanish era is Cheek Sangalang Fadriquela&rsquo;s 2013 book <strong><em>Kahoy: Wood in the Philippines, Wood and its Uses from the Pre-Hispanic to Spanish Colonial Philippines</em></strong>. Because wood was an important building material, Fadriquela&rsquo;s two-volume work is able to relate wood to diverse topics like the 1887 Philippine Exposition in Parque del Retiro in Madrid, the Pagrel Collection at the San Agustin Museum, the restoration of the Pasig Cathedral, the collection of heritage houses of Las Casas de Acuzar in Balanga, Bataan, the adaptive reuse of a Spanish colonial jail, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/281\">Carcel de Cebu</a>, as the Museo Sugbo, and a study of wood carving centers in the Philippines in the Cordilleras, Pampanga, Laguna, Bohol, Lanao del Sur, Sulu, and Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exhibitions on the Spanish Colonial Era.</strong> In 1998, celebrating the Centennial of Philippine Independence, Spain sponsored <strong><em>Manila 1571-1898 Occidente en Oriente</em></strong>, with an accompanying catalogue, at the San Agustin Museum. The project aimed to show the implantation of Western culture in the East, chiefly through architectural heritage. It was conceptualized by the Universidad de Alcala&rsquo;s Instituto Espa&ntilde;ol de Arquitectura, the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs&rsquo; Spanish Agency for International Cooperation (AECI), the Spanish Ministry of Industry, the Center for Studies and Experimentation on Public Works (CEDEX), and the Center for Historical Studies on Public Works and Urbanism (CEHOPU). The exhibition was curated by the architect Javier Aguilera Rojas, who also wrote the general texts of the catalogue. Artifacts were borrowed from at least 18 institutions in Spain, two in Mexico, and one in the United Kingdom. A three-dimensional model of the famous 1720s map of Manila by Antonio Fernandez de Rojas, and intricate miniature replicas of the Alcaiceria de San Fernando, the Puente de Ayala, the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a, the Ayuntamiento, and the Manila Cathedral were also commissioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the articles in the catalogue are of architectural interest. The richly illustrated catalogue boasted articles by some of the best Spanish experts of Philippine history, including Pedro Ortiz Armengol and Maria Lourdes Diaz Trechuelo Spinola. There were also articles by Filipino scholars Augusto Villalon and Fernando Zialcita.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Isabel Ma. Garcia Garcia&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bibliografia sobre Obras Publicas, Urbanismo y Arquitectura en Filipinas</em></strong> (Bibliography on Public Works, Urbanism, and Architecture) is a painstakingly compiled bibliography culled from Spanish and Philippine sources. The earliest item is Valdes Tamon&rsquo;s 1739 &ldquo;Relacion&rdquo; but the list jumps to 1850 and continues to contemporary works. Particularly noteworthy are articles prepared by Spanish architects and engineers during the last half-century of colonial rule, such as Antonio Domenech, Carlos de la Heras, Eduardo Lopez Navarro, Alejandro Olano, and Genaro Palacios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ma. Soledad Hernandez Paez de la Cadena&rsquo;s <strong><em>La Planimetria de Filipinas en los Archivos Espa&ntilde;oles</em></strong> (The Planometry of the Philippines in Spanish Archives) traces the archiving in Spain of more than 8,000 maps and plans on the Philippines. Of these, around 3,000 contain architectural, engineering, or urbanistic information. They are housed primarily in various archives in Spain. Many of these works are of artistic value. The list of names of engineers who signed the plans numbers more than 200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dolores Romero Mu&ntilde;oz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Puertos, Rios, Canales: La Ingenieria Espa&ntilde;ola en Manila&rdquo; (Ports, Rivers, Canals: Spanish Engineering in Manila) and Amaya Saenz Sanz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Los Ingenieros de Caminos y las Comunicaciones en Filipinas en la Segunda Mitad del Siglo XIX: El ferrocarril&rdquo; (The Engineers of Roads and Communication in the Philippines in the Second Half of the 19th Century: The Railroad) dealt with engineering projects. However, both articles emphasize the close relationship between engineers and architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reproduction of Graphic and Textual Material.</strong> Apart from academic discourses, another important contribution of Spanish scholarship is the reproduction of graphic and textual material from archives. Justa Moreno Garbayo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Fiestas en Manila a&ntilde;o 1825</em></strong> in 1977 reproduces an album of watercolors documenting the decoration of buildings for the reception of the King&rsquo;s portrait in Manila in 1825. <strong><em>Fiestas</em></strong> is an especially significant guide for the colors used for buildings at that time. In 1992, the Spanish Ministry of Public Works re-issued Rafael Cerero&rsquo;s 1890 <strong><em>Estudio Sobre la Resistencia y Estabilidad de los Edificios Sometidos a Huracanes y Terremotos</em></strong> (A Study on the Resistance and Stability of Buildings Subjected to Hurricanes and Earthquakes) with an Introduction by Alfonso Lopez Arroyo. Cerero&rsquo;s <strong><em>Estudio</em></strong> was based on actual field experience in the Philippines&mdash;the equations, recommendations, and strategies are still relevant more than a century after its publication. The plates present wooden joinery details and examples of useful hardware.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aspects from the collection of architectural plans and drawings in the National Archives of the Philippines were presented in an exhibition at the Intramuros Administration in 1995. The curator of the exhibition was Belen Ba&ntilde;as, then a researcher sent by the Spanish Agency for Cultural Cooperation, to assist in the cataloguing of the National Archives. A catalogue of the exhibition, <strong><em>Imagenes de Filipinas (Siglos XVIII-XIX)</em></strong>, was also published. A generous selection of architectural drawings and plans from the Spanish Ministry of Defense, the Servicio Historico Militar and Servicio Geografico del Ejercito, was also published in 1996. Volume 10 of <strong><em>Cartografia y Relaciones Historicas de Ultramar</em></strong> (Cartography and Historical Relations Overseas) is dedicated to the Philippines and comprises two books. Of special interest is the series of plans on military installations in Mindanao and Sulu.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>American Colonial Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research on the architecture of the American colonial era is not as extensive as that on the Spanish colonial era. There is no single publication that focuses on the American era alone. This is a big gap in architectural research because the half-century of American rule was characterized by a massive, systematic, and intense architectural and infrastructure program, funded by the Insular government, to transform the Philippines into a bastion and paradigm of &ldquo;American-style democracy&rdquo; in Asia. The program involved building roads and bridges, improving and upgrading what the Spanish had left; modernizing the railroad and other means of transportation, and building government offices, schools, hospitals, and providing the citizenry with amenities like parks, and recreational areas. Governance, health and sanitation, and education were high in the American agenda. This was also the era when art nouveau and art deco were introduced to the Philippines, rivaling the revivalist styles already introduced in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The work of Lourdes Montinola as editor and writer of <strong><em>Art Deco in the Philippines</em></strong>, published by Artpost Asia, comes as a welcome addition to studies on the American period. Despite the meager publication on the American era, there has been scholarly work in the form of thesis and dissertations submitted to the UP, such as Veronica Amarra Dado&rsquo;s 1996 study titled &ldquo;Philippine public elementary school buildings during the American Period, 1898-1941,&rdquo; which is about public schools in the Manila area. Gerardo Lucena&rsquo;s 1998 thesis, &ldquo;The Religious Paintings of San Beda Church, Abbey of Montserrat (The Allegories and the Apotheosis) Manila, 1930-1934,&rdquo; was about the work of Dom Lesmes Lopez, a Spaniard, and Bro Salvador Alberich, who decorated the neo-Gothic church of the Abbey built between Feb 1925 and Jan 1926.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Josefina S. Pineda&rsquo;s 2008 thesis &ldquo;Sining sa Libingan: Sementerio de Dilao at Sementerio del Norte de Manila (1814-1941)&rdquo; is about cemeteries. Although the starting year begins during the Spanish colonial era, its terminal year is 1941, the eve of World War II. Since sanitation and health were concerns of the American government, Pineda&rsquo;s study fits in with the spirit of American era architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The works and career of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a>, a sculptor who provided sculpture and decorative pieces for churches, public buildings, and homes, spanned the Spanish and American era. He made his name in the 19th century with his work on the Santo Domingo and the San Ignacio churches, and later on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a>, the Central Post Office, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, and the Legarda public school designed by Andres Luna de San Pedro in the early 20th century. He introduced tropical motifs in his version of art deco, called <strong>estilo Tampinco</strong>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a> and Vibal Foundation published <strong><em>The Art and Life of Isabelo Tampinco</em></strong> by Santiago Albano Pilar on the occasion of the opening of the Tampinco Gallery at the National Museum of the Philippines&rsquo; Museum of Fine Arts, in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_7\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Visual references for the American era are found in a handful of books on vintage postcards and photographs. Although photography was introduced during the Spanish colonial era, its popularity and widespread use came during the American era. A couple of books that have been published show pictures of architecture from the end of the Spanish era but mostly from the American colonial era. In 1994, Jonathan Best published <strong><em>Philippine Picture Postcards 1900-1920</em></strong> and in 1998, <strong><em>Philippine Album: American Era Photographs 1900-1930</em></strong> under Bookmark, Inc. Lucy Urgello Miller, in 2010, published <strong><em>Glimpses of Old Cebu: Images of the Colonial Era</em></strong>, containing a selection of photographs and postcards from the thousands she has collected. Many of them showcased architectural buildings and styles. Published digitally is Gerard Lico&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Philippines through the lens of an American soldier (1898-1907): The Harry Whitfield Harnish photographic collection</em></strong> in 2004, which contains images of American-era buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_8\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"period\" name=\"period\"></a>The Period of the Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contemporary period began in 1946, the year of Philippine Independence, and runs to the present. It may be divided into Republic III, 1946-1972; Republic IV, 1972-1986; Republic V, 1986 to the present. Because the sections will be too short for lack of published research, this essay will not make further subdivisions into the different eras of the Republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to books, many of the research conducted during this time was also published electronically, such as the works from the NCCA which came out in CDs, which included the works of UP professor and writer Gerard Lico, <strong><em>Arkitekturang Filipino: Sources and Places in History</em></strong> in 2002, and <strong><em>Building Modernity: A Century of Philippine Architecture and the Allied Arts</em></strong> in 2008. While they are general works that straddle the various periods, they also bring the discussion of architecture to the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two general works that discuss Philippine style in architecture were edited by Elizabeth Reyes, titled <strong><em>Filipino Style</em></strong>, 2004, and <strong><em>Philippine Style: Design and Architecture</em></strong>, 2013. Although both begin with the indigenous and the Hispanic tradition, the books focus on the transformation and contemporary use of these heritage styles, especially in domestic architecture. Thus, styles are read through the vantage of contemporary design practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gerard Lico&rsquo;s 2000 thesis, &ldquo;Edifice Complex: The Discourse of Power in Marcos State Architecture at the Cultural Center of the Philippines&rdquo; is an authoritative source on martial law architecture. This thesis was subsequently published by Ateneo de Manila University Press in 2003 as <strong><em>Edifice Complex: Power, Myth, and Marcos State Architecture.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many publications on the contemporary period are about the specific architectural projects, sites or works or the career and life work of Philippine architects. Ma. Alessandra L. Hermano and Josephine L. Hermano&rsquo;s 2001 book <strong><em>At Home with Filipino Art and Artists</em></strong>, features the homes and ateliers of 21 artists. The book is an unusual take on contemporary architecture as it shows Filipino artists&rsquo; homes and studios in the Philippines and abroad, some conventional, others quirky, set in various settings, urban or rural, on a mountain-top or by the sea, close to the ground or in a high rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Tahanan: A House Reborn</em></strong>, published in 2003 by Reynaldo G. Alejandro and Vicente Roman S. Santos, focuses on the heritage rescue of the residence of Roman R. Santos, built in Navotas in 1917. Threatened by destruction due to flooding, heavy traffic, and urban decay, the descendants of Santos transferred their ancestral home to Antipolo in 2002. The process was carefully documented and serves as guide to similar tasks of rescue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manuel Quezon III, Paulo Alcazaren, and Jeremy Barns came out with <strong><em>Malaca&ntilde;an Palace: The Official Illustrated History</em></strong> in 2005. This book traces the history of Malaca&ntilde;an and its transformation through renovation, remodeling, and expansion, especially in 1979 during the Marcos era, and the restoration done under Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other architectural books came out in the 2000s. In 2007, <strong><em>Turning Pages: 50 Years of Bel-Air</em></strong>, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3734\">Cid Reyes</a>, was a commemorative coffee table book for one of Makati&rsquo;s pioneer gated village. <strong><em>Heartbeat: Manila Hilton</em></strong>, published in 2011 and edited by Marla Yotoko Chorengel and Letty Jacinto Lopez, was a collection of short essays about the planning, construction, and grand opening of the Manila Hilton in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2628\">Paulo G. Alcazaren</a> also edited <strong><em>Parks for a Nation: The Rizal Park and 50 Years of the National Parks Development Committee</em></strong> in 2013. It tells the history of the National Parks Development Committee and its signature and principal park in Manila. As an open space, Rizal Park was integral to the 1905 design of Daniel H. Burnham for the capital city, Manila. Over the years the park was transformed, modified, and built over. Illustrated with vintage and new photographs, the book shows the visual richness of the park and highlights the role it plays in the life of a city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The Philippine Arena: A Monument to An Enduring Faith</em></strong> was published by Iglesia ni Cristo in 2014, on the occasion of its centennial. It documents, through text and photographs, the construction of a state-of-the-art sports arena and meeting place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many contemporary works also focus on architects and their legacies. <strong><em>Architecture of Leandro Locsin</em></strong> by Nicholas Polites from 1977 is about National Artist Locsin, who designed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">UP Church of the Holy Sacrifice</a> and the Isatana Nurul Iman Palace in Brunei, as well as office buildings, cultural centers, and theaters, like the demolished Rizal Theater in Makati.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Pioneer and Modernist Iconoclast: The Architectural Legacy of Pablo S. Antonio</em></strong> by Gerard Lico is about National Artist Pablo S. Antonio, who was posthumously awarded in 1976. After completing his architecture degree in the University of London, as a scholar of his firm Mapua, Arevalo, Siochi Construction Co, Antonio designed buildings that departed from the traditional classicist strain. Among others, he designed the FEU Complex and the Ramon Roces Publication Building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Designing Filipino: The Architecture of Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa</em></strong> and <strong><em>Beyond the <strong><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></strong>: 16 Climate Conscious Tropical Homes by the Ma&ntilde;osas</em></strong> by Eric Caruncho document the design philosophy of the Ma&ntilde;osas, who work with the enduring qualities of vernacular architecture, like lightness and being light-filled, dialogue between outdoor and indoor and the use of natural material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other collections on Philippine architects and their works have been published. Ludette Zaragosa-Banson and Ruben D. F. Defeo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Jose V. Zaragoza: Architecture for God, for Man</em></strong> focuses on the churches and residences designed by Jose V. Zaragoza; <strong><em>The Landscape Architecture of <strong><strong>Ildefonso P. Santos</strong></strong></em></strong> by Jeannie J. Javelosa is about Ildefonso Paez Santos&rsquo;s pioneering work in landscape architecture, for which he was given numerous awards including the prestigious National Artist Award for landscape architecture. <strong><em>Form + Function</em></strong>, published by the architectural firm, W. V. Coscolluela &amp; Associates is about the projects of the firm. Similarly, <strong><em>Planning &amp; Design: Palafox Associates, The First 20 Years</em></strong> is a 308-page book that illustrates and documents 200 projects of the firm that embody the company&rsquo;s vision of the future of urbanization. While some of these works might be taken to task for being marketing tools for a company, nonetheless, they give data and information that can be used for more analytical, systematic, and critical works, thus expanding and deepening the appreciation and understanding of Philippine architecture. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>Architectural schools are formal institutions of learning, where courses in the arts and sciences of building structures are taught to students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The builders of indigenous houses were not trained in schools. They learned the skills of gathering materials like bamboo, reeds, nipa, cogon, wood, and vines, and of building houses from these materials from their elders or from the masters in their communities. Specialized skills like that of carving the <strong>okir</strong> or <strong>ukkil</strong> was learned by apprentices from master carvers. The building of the house itself was done through a system of cooperation, where the owner took care of the meals and other needs of the builders during the construction period.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There was no school of architecture in the Philippines during the Spanish regime. There was, however, the Escuela Practica y Profesional de Artes y Oficios de Manila, founded by the Spanish government in 1890, which granted the title <strong>maestro de obras</strong> or master builder. One of its first graduates was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Liceo de Manila, a private institution founded in 1900 and headed by Leon Ma. Guerrero, offered an academic course for maestros de obras. In 1902, the Academia de Arquitectura y Agrimensura de Filipinas, a professional organization for architecture, civil engineering, and surveying was founded. It was later called the Academia de Ingenieria, Arquitectura y Agrimensura de Filipinas. In 1904, the Academia established the Escuela de Ingenieria y Arquitectura, which offered a five-year course in civil engineering and architecture. It was attached to the Liceo, and its faculty included members of the Academia. It closed after one year. In 1908, it was reopened, this time offering a three-year course for architecture, civil engineering, and electrical engineering. It ceased to operate in 1912.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first decades of the 20th century, young Filipinos went to the United States (US) to study architecture. The first US-trained Filipino architects included Carlos Barreto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, and<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2702\"> Antonio Toledo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, Mapua founded the Mapua Institute of Technology, a night school for working students, which offered, aside from engineering, a four-year course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Architecture. In 1930, the University of Santo Tomas (UST) opened its own School of Fine Arts and Architecture. Adamson University opened its School of Architecture in 1941. In the same year, the Philippine College of Design was founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2680\">Angel Nakpil</a>, and Gines Rivera. It did not survive World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cebu Institute of Technology opened its own School of Architecture in 1946. This was the first Philippine school of architecture outside Manila. In 1947, the National University established its own architecture degree program. In 1949, the first school of architecture in Mindanao was opened by the Mindanao Colleges in Davao City, but it closed in 1953.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, schools of architecture were opened by the following institutions: Far Eastern Air Transport Inc or FEATI in 1952; University of San Carlos in Cebu City in 1953; Far Eastern University and Manuel L. Quezon University in 1954; Francisco Colleges in 1955; the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1956; the University of San Agustin in Iloilo City in 1960; Saint Louis University in Baguio City in 1962; and the University of Mindanao in Davao City in 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1990s, there were 40 schools of architecture throughout the country, 15 of which were in the National Capital Region (NCR). The number has been growing as new schools have been offering more architecture courses. To date, 67 has been given as the number of schools in the Philippines, of which 16 are in NCR. Of the 67, 44 are accredited educational institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Luzon, these institutions are: Divine Word College of Laoag in Ilocos Norte; Isabela State University in Ilagan, Isabela; University of the Cordilleras in Baguio City, Benguet; University of Luzon in Dagupan City, Pangasinan; Don Honorio Ventura Technological State University in Bacolor, Pampanga; Cavite State University in Indang, Cavite; Holy Angel University in Angeles City, Pampanga; Don Bosco Technical College in Mandaluyong City; Divine Word College of Calapan in Oriental Mindoro; and University of Nueva Caceres in Naga, Camarines Sur. In the Visayas are these: West Visayas College of Science and Technology and University of San Agustin, both in Iloilo City, Iloilo; La Consolacion College Bacolod in Negros Occidental; Foundation University and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\"><strong>Silliman University</strong></a>, both in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental; and University of Bohol in Tagbilaran City. In Mindanao are University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines in Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental; La Salle University in Ozamis City, Misamis Occidental; Surigao State College of Technology in Surigao City, Surigao; Caraga State University in Cabadbaran City, Agusan del Norte; and Notre Dame of Dadiangas University in General Santos City, South Cotabato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its foundation in 1956, the UP College of Architecture has offered a five-year bachelor&rsquo;s course, which all other schools followed starting in 1967. During the five-year course, a student receives a certificate of draftsmanship at the end of the second year, and a certificate for construction supervision at the end of the third year. The architecture curriculum includes architectural design, building technology, utilities, landscape architecture, site planning, urban and regional planning, housing, history of architecture, theory of architectural design, and professional practice, as well as drawing, color rendering, drafting, perspective drawing, and presentation techniques. Mathematics and science subjects include algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry, differential calculus, integral calculus, physics, earth and life sciences, and architectural structures, focusing on timber, concrete, and steel. UP now offers master&rsquo;s degrees in architecture and tropical landscape architecture. Likewise, UST offers a graduate course for the degree of master of science in architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from university degrees, there are institutions that provide training and apprenticeship. Escuela Taller de Filipinas is not so much an architectural school but a school that trains students in skills related to heritage conservation. Established internationally in 1985, the Escuela Taller opened a school in Intramuros in 2009. As the first Escuela Taller in Asia, the school trained Filipino youth in skills such as wood and stone carving, carpentry, and decorative painting. The curriculum also includes courses in electricity, plumbing, and related fields. Students also attend workshops and lectures on architectural design and history. They complement the work of architects involved in restoration. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.
