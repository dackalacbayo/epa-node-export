He was born in Quiapo, Manila on 8 February 1886. He died in 1955. He married Rosa Sevilla, writer and founder of the Instituto de Mujeres. Among the couple&rsquo;s children was Aurelio Alvero, a poet and renowned art collector who wrote his poetry and art criticism under the nom de plume &ldquo;Magtanggol Asa.&rdquo; Emilio Alvero finished his basic education at the Quiapo Parochial School. He studied painting privately under Lorenzo Guerrero, sculpture under Romualdo de Jesus, and scenographic painting under Cesare Alberoni. He was a contemporary of Fernando Amorsolo and Alejandro Cawed at the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a painter, Alvero is known for his realistic still lifes. In <b><i>Excursion</i></b>, Alvero&rsquo;s subject matter is boiled rice rendered so realistically, complete with spilled vinegar rolling down a banana leaf. Alvero&rsquo;s <b><i>Table Delicacies</i></b>, 1928, is outstanding not only because of the realism of the dish of tuna, the cantaloupe, and the basket of vegetables in the background, but also because the composition consists of mostly oval shapes which are echoed in the oval shape of the painting itself and the concave glass cover of the painting. At least six other still life paintings by this artist are preserved, one remarkable for its portrayal of makopa and balimbing, another a rich person&rsquo;s setting of sumptuous dishes laid out on a realistically depicted crocheted table mantel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alvero also painted other scenes. <b><i>A Nipa Hut</i></b>, which is outstanding for its realistic capturing of the rugged materials of the house, is in the Lourdes V.

		"text": "<p><strong>Pablo Antonio </strong>(<strong>Pablo Sebero Antonio</strong>) is a National Artist for Architecture. He was born in Binondo, Manila on 25 January 1902. He died on 14 June 1975. His father, Apolonio Antonio, was a <strong>maestro de obras</strong> (master builder) who dabbled in painting and sculpture; his mother, Trinidad Sebero, died when he was very young. He and his wife Marina have two sons, Ramon and Luis, who are architects and interior designers. Antonio worked as a draftsman for the Bureau of Public Works while attending high school at night. After taking a correspondence course in architecture and structural engineering, he took formal courses in architecture at Mapua Institute of Technology but soon dropped out due to the pressure of work. Antonio resigned from the bureau and worked as a draftsman and construction foreman for the Mapua Arevalo Siochi Construction Company, later called the Santa Clara Construction Co. In 1927, one of the company&rsquo;s owners sent Antonio on a scholarship to the University of London where he finished the five-year architectural course in three years. He returned to Manila, passed the government examinations, and became a registered architect in 1932. Widespread recognition of his gifts led to his appointment as architect of various institutions and corporations, among them Far Eastern University (FEU), Philippine National Bank, and Manila Railroad Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1933, he completed his first major work, the Ideal Theater on Rizal Ave, Manila. He subsequently designed the FEU Building on Quezon Blvd, the Boulevard-Alhambra (now Bel-Air) Apartments on Dewey (now Roxas) Blvd, the Ramon Roces Publications Building, and the White Cross Preventorium. Antonio&rsquo;s works after World War II include the Manila Polo Club, the Capitan Luis Gonzaga Building on Rizal Ave and Carriedo, the FEU Administration and Science Buildings, and the Galaxy Theater on Rizal Ave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonio&rsquo;s buildings represented a new direction in Philippine architecture. They were characterized by clean lines, plain surfaces, and bold rectangular masses&mdash;a striking departure from the traditionalist and academic style prevailing at the time. Moreover, Antonio regarded every design project as unique and imparted to every building he created a distinctive form and character, avoiding anything that might be seen as a trademark. He used wood, stone, and reinforced concrete to create refinement, warmth, and virility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the FEU Building combines formal symmetry with a robust sturdiness, the Ramon Roces Publications Building is irregular in plan, asymmetrical in its facade, and characterized by movement and diverse forms. Like many architects of his time, Antonio used the sunbreak, but departed from the general pattern. In the Capitan Luis Gonzaga Building, horizontal slabs project from ceiling and windowsill height, while vertical fins of half-story height are staggered, creating a contrast between continuous horizontal planes, and broken vertical planes. Antonio considered the Manila Polo Club one of his best works. The sprawling building, sheltered by hip roofs and using wood and stone with great visual impact, is both festive and virile in character. The woodwork on the ceiling of the social lounge is like a huge abstract sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonio was a member of the Board of Examiners for Architects, 1936-37, president of the Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA), 1941-44, and member of the Quezon City Capitol Site on City Planning, 1946-47. He was named Architect of the Year by PIA in 1952 and given the National Award of Merit for Architecture in 1954 by the Philippine Republic. In 1956, he was listed in Asia&rsquo;s <strong><em>Who&rsquo;s Who</em></strong>, a Hong Kong publication. In 1971, he received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. In 1972, he was conferred the Republic Cultural Heritage Award. In 1976, he was posthumously named National Artist for architecture. A book titled <strong><em>The Architectural Legacy of Pablo S. Antonio, 1902-1975</em></strong>, edited by Sylvia Roces Montilla, was launched in 2013. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

Subsequently, he opened his own architectural and surveying firm. As captain in the Engineering Corps of Emilio Aguinaldo&rsquo;s revolutionary army, he supervised the repair of the <strong>convento</strong> of the Barasoain Church in 1898 for Aguinaldo&rsquo;s government.

The Hidalgo house contained neo-Gothic touches whereas the Bautista Lin house, following what was then a contemporary trend, incorporated art nouveau motifs to match the set of Vienna Sezession furniture around which the house was designed. In some of his works Arellano also used native plant forms as decorative motifs. Commercial buildings he designed included Roman Ongpin&rsquo;s bazaar, El 82, on Plaza Calderon de la Barca, which had such renaissance features as oval dormer windows and a four-column porch with a pediment and balustrade; the Hotel de Francia and the Carmelo and Bauermann Building on Azcarraga.

		"text": "<p><strong>ARELLANO</strong><strong>, JUAN</strong> ( <strong>Juan de Guzman Arellano</strong> )b. Tondo, Manila 25 Apr 1888. d. 5 Dec 1960. Architect, painter. He was the son of Luis Arellano and Bartola de Guzman. He married Natividad de Ocampo, a singer, with whom he had a son, Oscar, an architect. When he was 12, his father died and his elder brother Arcadio, an architect, took care of him and his schooling. As a boy, he studied painting under  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\"><strong>Lorenzo Guerrero</strong></a></strong> </strong> and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa </a></strong> and took lessons in sculpture. In 1906, he studied architecture at the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia. After traveling through Europe, he did postgraduate work in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and attended the Beaux Arts School in New York. When he returned to the Philippines, he worked with his brother Arcadio on such projects as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/305\"><strong>Gota de Leche Building</strong></a> on Lepanto St and the old Casino Espa&ntilde;ol on Taft Ave. He became assistant architect, then supervising architect, and finally consulting architect for the Bureau of Public Works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arellano influenced the development of Filipino architecture in his time, not only in its neoclassic phase but also the art deco and later nativist phases. Like many architects trained in the United States in the early 20th century, he came under the influence of the Paris Ecole des Beaux Arts and promoted the neoclassic style. This can be seen in his major works, which include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\"><strong>Legislative Building</strong></a> (presently the  <strong><strong> <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> main office and Museum of Fine Arts), completed in 1926; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\"><strong>Post Office Building</strong></a>, 1931; and the Villamor Hall at the University of the Philippines (UP) campus on Taft Ave. In contrast, the  <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong>, 1931, combines art deco and local forms, such as bamboo stalks and mangoes. These four buildings were destroyed during World War II and rebuilt according to the original plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1930s, Arellano designed government buildings for Banaue, Ifugao, and Glan, Cotabato, making use of local architectural forms. He prepared plans for the landscaping of some sections of Manila, particularly Padre Burgos Ave, Harrison Park, the North and South Port Areas, Dewey Blvd, and the Malaca&ntilde;an grounds. He made the master plan for the UP Diliman campus. In the design of some major buildings, he used native forms like the salakot and the nipa hut roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arellano was also a painter. Most of his paintings were landscapes showing the influence of Impressionism and Fauvism. Other paintings reveal his interest in architecture and landscaping of parks and gardens. He also did a number of highly sensitive portraits, which combine psychological insight and a sense of design. In 1967, Arellano was given the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award by the city of Manila posthumously. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

His parents are  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2632\"><strong>Arcadio Arellano</strong></a></strong> </strong> and Amalia Ocampo. He is the nephew of architect  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\"><strong>Juan Arellano</strong></a></strong> </strong>. He married Liwayway Almario.

At 17, he began working as draftsman and salesman for Findley Engineering and Construction Company Inc. He was head draftsman in the office of his uncle Juan Arellano in 1937-39. After graduating with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in architecture from Mapua Institute of Technology in 1940, he began his private practice. In 1966, he formed the firm Otilio Arellano and Associates. Arellano was president of the Philippine Institute of Architects, the United Architects of the Philippines, and the United Technological Organizations of the Philippines. In 1961, he was named honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arellano also served as officer in various capacities in the Lions Club. He founded the Philippine Youth Welfare Coordinating Council and was its president, 1956-81. He was president of the Philippine Mental Health Association, and founder and vice-chair of the Board of Trustees of the Rizal Youth Development Foundation. Arellano was a pioneer in serving out-of-school youth. He believed that an architect should also be a &ldquo;builder of men.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arellano was notable for employing native motifs in a number of his works. As chief architect of the 1953 Philippine International Fair, he designed, among other structures, the entry arch <strong><em>Gateway to the East</em></strong>, using the form of the mandala. His design for the Philippine Pavilion in the 1964 New York World&rsquo;s Fair was inspired by the salakot. As consulting architect of the FILOIL Refinery Corporation, he designed service stations using the Maranao <strong>panolong</strong> (protruding beam-end) as a motif. In 1978, he supervised the restoration of the  <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong>, designed by Juan Arellano in 1931 and destroyed in World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his 40 years of practice, he designed government buildings, industrial buildings, commercial office buildings, banks, movie houses, shopping centers, and residences. A list of selected works includes the National Bureau of Investigation Building on Taft Ave; the Sining Kayumanggi at the Mehan Gardens; the Palacio del Gobernador in Intramuros; the Philippine School of Business Administration on Aurora Blvd, Quezon City; the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation Building on Buendia Ave, Makati; and the San Juan Municipal Center on N.

After finishing high school in San Beda in 1935, he studied at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), finishing a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in architecture in 1939. He served for a year as reserve officer in the United States Army, then studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), earning another bachelor&rsquo;s degree. He began working for a master&rsquo;s degree, but with the outbreak of World War II, he entered active service in the United States Army. In 1945, he resumed studies at MIT and received a master&rsquo;s degree in 1946. From 1946 to 1949 he worked as a designer in architecture offices in California: Kauffman, Lippincott and Eggers; Kistner, Curtis and Wright; and Welton Becket and Associates. Becket was one of the architects who designed the Jai-Alai Building, completed in 1940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1949, he returned to Manila and was engaged as a junior associate of Gines Rivera, collaborating with him on the design of the Ateneo de Manila campus at Loyola Heights. In 1952, he established his own office, C.D. Arguelles and Associates. He taught at the UST School of Architecture, 1949-59, and served as dean, 1954-59. He was a member of the Philippine Institute of Architects, which elected him president, 1958; fellow, 1966; and chancellor of the College of Fellows, 1988. He was active in the Philippine Institute of Architects, and an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects.

His buildings are notable for having employed the latest technological developments, such as heat-resistant glass, metal sun-baffles, interior systems, and acoustical design. He also designed the 600-unit Philamlife Homes in Quezon City, a planned community for middle-income families, with several types of standard units. The project was designed along organic lines, following the contours of the site, with spacious areas for common use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arguelles received the city of Manila&rsquo;s Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award and the Papal Award Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice in 1998, and the Cultural Center of the Philippines Centennial Honors for the Arts in 1999.

The son of Matias and Manuela Bermejo, Julian entered the Augustinian novitiate at age 15. He pronounced his vows in the order in 1793, left Cadiz with 20 other Augustinians in 1796, and arrived in Manila most likely on 11 Mar 1797. His first assignment was as parish priest of Boljoon, succeeding Fr Manuel Cordero on 19 Oct 1802. Promotion to higher offices in the order followed: prior of the Cebu Convent of Santo Ni&ntilde;o in 1825, president of the chapter of 1829, prior of Bacolor, Pampanga, in 1833, and provincial in 1837-39. But it is as builder and military commander that Bermejo is better known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving in Boljoon, Bermejo found the church still unfinished, a replacement for an earlier church destroyed by slave raiders in 1782. He completed the church but judged the palisade surrounding the church inadequate. So he surrounded the church complex with a stone wall and a bulwark or strong house, facing the sea. From then on, he initiated the fortification of other churches in southern Cebu and devised a system of communication called<em>telegrafo</em>, based on a network of watchtowers and signal flags and flares, bells and drums. The linchpin of his system was a tower on the hill immediately north of the Boljoon complex. When Bermejo was done, he had constructed a string of towers along the shores of southern Cebu from Carcar to Ta&ntilde;on, later Santander.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He organized militias consisting of sentinels, who manned the towers day and night and watched the seas with their telescopes ready to warn the townspeople of an impending raiding party. He also prepared seaborne fleets ready to repel the raiders and a volunteer army for land defense. So effective was Bermejo that after a sea battle in 1815 off Sumilon Island, offshore between Oslob and Santander, no raiders attacked southern Cebu thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1827, Bermejo joined an expedition to Bohol, under Cebu&rsquo;s<em>alcalde mayor</em>(governor) Don Jose Lazaro Cairo, to reintegrate the remnants of Dagohoy&rsquo;s rebel camps to lowland society. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p><strong>BURNHAM</strong><strong>, DANIEL</strong> ( <strong>Daniel Hudson Burnham</strong> ) b. Henderson, New York, USA 4 Sep 1846. d. Heidelberg, Germany 1 Jun 1912. Architect, city planner. He was educated in Chicago and Waltman, Massachusetts, where he graduated from high school. Failing admissions tests to Harvard and Yale, and leaving an aborted political career, he worked as a draftsman for the architectural firm of William Le Baron Jenney. From there he apprenticed with the Chicago firm Carter, Drake and Wright. There he met John Wellborn Root, 1850-91, and in 1873 their partnership began, eventually developing into a leading architectural firm. Burnham &amp; Root emphasized steel-frame construction, which made the skyscraper possible. Their complementary personalities suited this partnership. Root was quiet, weak at people skills but had a sharp mechanical mind. He was well-versed in physics and an astute draftsman. Burnham was good at dealing with people and he dreamt big. A much quoted saying of his was: &ldquo;Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo; The firm designed many landmark buildings in Chicago, New York, Washington DC, and London. Work on the Columbian Exposition or Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair, 1893, and his designs for Washington DC, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Chicago established Burnham&rsquo;s reputation as a city planner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Columbian Exposition, where he worked closely with landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmstead, and where other architects were commissioned to design buildings concretized Burnham&rsquo;s vision of the &ldquo;City Beautiful,&rdquo; which followed French Beaux Arts design principles that favored neoclassical architecture, characterized by symmetry, balance, and splendor. The area chosen for the exposition was a 630-acre property on Jackson Park. This largely undeveloped land gave Burnham the blank canvas on which to build his vision of well-planned city come true. The Columbian Exposition was called the &ldquo;White City&rdquo; because its building were finished in white stucco and illuminated by electrical lights at night. The Columbian exposition would mark Burnham&rsquo;s other works and city plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As president of the American Institute of Architects in 1894, he established close friendships with high government officials, including Pres Theodore Roosevelt. He recommended a young friend ambitious for a foreign assignment, William Cameron Forbes, whom Roosevelt appointed to the Philippines in 1904.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes sought to improve infrastructure in the Philippines and listened to William Howard Taft, then secretary of war, who suggested that a landscape architect help design <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\"><strong>Baguio</strong></a>, &ldquo;a new city 5,000 feet above the sea, which will be to the Philippines what Simla is to India&rdquo; (Klassen 1987, 187). Consulted by Forbes, Burnham volunteered to go; he stayed in the Philippines for about six weeks in 1904. He proposed a grand plan for Manila involving a gridiron street pattern with diagonal thoroughfares converging at rotundas of various sizes to connect the outlying towns and districts bordering Manila. He planned for plenty of open spaces, greenery, and fountains. Government buildings would be the focus of the city, and he chose the sites for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\"><strong>Army and Navy Club</strong></a>, Philippine General Hospital, and apparently the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\"><strong>Post Office</strong></a>. For the design of Baguio, he proposed to site government buildings on the ridge surrounding a central meadow, known in the local Ibaloy language as<em>kafagway</em>, however cautioning that monumental hilltop constructions be avoided so as not to mar the beautiful landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither in Manila nor in Baguio was Burnham&rsquo;s recommendations strictly followed, but he left his mark on the Philippine landscape. A park is named after him in Baguio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1910, he was appointed chairperson of the National Commission on the Fine Arts by Americanpresident Taft. At the time of his death, Burnham headed one of the largest architectural offices in the United States. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

He went on further studies from 1993 to 1994 at Columbia University, New York, where he obtained a master&rsquo;s degree in advanced architectural design. In between his studies, he worked for the architectural firm of Carlos Zapata and Peter Pran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Pratt, Calma&rsquo;s mentors encouraged him to look for sources of inspiration outside architecture and create new definitions of space. Returning to the Philippines in 1997, he worked with his father&rsquo;s architectural firm, Lor Calma and Associates, which not only designed buildings but also built furniture and through Lor founded the Philippine School of Interior Design. Ed has since become design principal, architect, and interior designer of the company. Like his father, Ed is committed to modernism but his works break away from the modernist mold by drawing inspiration not from the box, which characterized early modernism in the Philippines, but from nature and from letting space and location influence the design. The term &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; might be aptly applied to his designs. While Lor&rsquo;s works used local material, Ed&rsquo;s works use new materials like structural glass and metal, and stones like travertine and onyx, which are increasingly available because of the global market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ed&rsquo;s two iconic buildings are the De La Salle University&ndash;College of Saint Benilde&rsquo;s School of Design and Arts (CSB-SDA), established in 1995, and the Mind Museum, completed in 2011. Both buildings are designed from inside out&mdash;that is, the interior spaces defined what the skin or exterior looks like. The 14-story CSB-SDA has the theater jutting out of the facade to serve as canopy for the lower floor. The facade is not a straight line but is angled, with the center pushing forward. The interior is whitewashed and sheeted in glass, which allows light in and opens to a view of the surroundings. The Mind Museum is described as &ldquo;amorphic&rdquo; or formless. It has no clear facade. As an organic form with multiple entrances, it can be viewed from anywhere. The cell was the inspiration for a building. Its design was allowed to evolve through interaction with the site and the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ed Calma Architecture, the professional name of the company Ed runs, has been involved in many projects, some of which have been built while others have yet to be realized. The projects include resorts like Bantayan Resort, Lio Resort, Samal Island Hotel; infrastructures like Serendra Bridge, Lighthouse; office buildings like CLIPP Center, MDI Building, Landco Pacific Building; residential design; interior design like the Mind Museum, De Gallego Apartment; commercial/retail design like Z Bar, Univers, R12; education architecture like DLSU CSB-SDA and Henry Sy Innovation Center; museum and exhibitions like Expo Japan 2005, Expo Hannover 2000, Expo Zaragosa 2008; and master plans like those for Liberty, Azotea, and the  <strong><strong> <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ed&rsquo;s works have been featured in a number of books&mdash;namely, <strong><em>Peter Pran of Ellerbe Becket: Recent Works</em></strong>, 1991; Raul A.

His wife is Estella Gongon; they have five children, two of whom are architects. He holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in architecture from Mapua Institute of Technology, 1954. Since 1956 he has been engaged in interior design, furniture design and manufacturing, and architectural design. He heads the firm Lor L. Calma Designs Associates Inc. Calma is founding member and past president of the Philippine Institute of Interior Designers. He was a member of the first specialty board for interior designers of the Professional Regulation Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calma&rsquo;s projects include the interiors of banks, offices, hotels, restaurants, clubhouses, resorts, and residences. He designed and executed the interiors of the Development Bank of the Philippines, Buendia, Makati; Philippine National Bank, Escolta, Manila; Development Academy of the Philippines, Tagaytay City; Silahis Hotel, Roxas Blvd, Manila; Midtown Ramada Hotel, Pedro Gil, Manila; Puerto Azul Hotel and Beach Resort, Ternate, Cavite; and Benguet Center, Mandaluyong, Metro Manila. His style is modern, inspired by the Bauhaus style, using chromium, glass, and leather. In the 1980s, he went into the postmodern style, which tends toward revivalist and romantic motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering with his son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2641\"><strong>Ed</strong></a>, Calma&rsquo;s architectural firm has pushed the boundaries of design with deconstructed architecture pieces like the DLSU&ndash;Saint Benilde&rsquo;s School of Art and Design on Singalong St and the Mind Museum at the Fort in Bonifacio Global City. These works are designed inside out, with the exterior hinting at what may lie within. For Saint Benilde&rsquo;s, Calma designed the theater as a structure that juts beyond the facade and serves as a canopy for the lower floor. The Mind Museum is more organic. In 2009, his exhibit titled <strong><em>Architect</em></strong> <em><strong>Lor Calma: Paintings and Sculptures</strong> </em>was held at the Ayala Museum, Greenbelt Art Park, Makati. His sculpture <strong><em>Transformation</em></strong> combines three forms of stacked laminated glass, 5-10 m tall, that represent Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. In 2012, <strong><em>Calma&mdash;Lor and Ed&mdash;An Exhibit of New Works</em></strong>, was mounted at LRI Design Plaza, Makati City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1985, Calma received an award from the Philippine Institute of Interior Designers as founding member and for his achievement as architect, interior designer, and furniture designer. In 1988, he was conferred the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award as outstanding interior designer, by the city of Manila. Other awards include the Gintong Ama Award for Arts and Culture, 1993; Lifetime Award for Interior Design and Architecture, 1997; Hall of Fame, Philippine Institute of Interior Design, 2006; and Most Outstanding Kapampangan in Arts and Architecture, 2010.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p><strong>CBCP EPISCOPAL COMMISSION FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE OF THE CHURCH</strong> ( <strong>ECCHC</strong> )Formerly known as the Permanent Committee for the Cultural Heritage of the Church (PCCHC), ECCHC was established by the Catholic Bishops&rsquo; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) during its 73rd general assembly on 8 Jul 1996 (CBCP 1996). One of the 30 or so working bodies serving the permanent assembly of the Philippine Catholic episcopacy and the individual bishops in their respective sees, the PCCHC was under the Department of Doctrine and Religious Affairs for purposes of administration and coordination (CBCP 2000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, the CBCP Episcopal Commission on Culture issued a mandate to address emerging issues and concerns related to the pastoral care of the Church&rsquo;s tangible cultural heritage. This concern came to a focus when CBCP created the PCCHC, inspired by the establishment by Pope John Paul II in 1988 of the Pontifical Commission for Preserving the Artistic and Historic Patrimony of the Church attached to the Congregation for the Clergy, a department in the Roman Curia (John Paul II 1988). The pope later renamed it as the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church and made it an autonomous department with its own president and staff, maintaining periodic contact with the Pontifical Council for Culture (John Paul II 1993). PCCHC became a consultative body and an independent working entity within the CBCP with its own chairperson (always a bishop) and an executive secretary (a priest). It is internally organized with an executive board of four bishop-members and an advisory board of appointed lay experts drawn from the multidisciplinary sciences of cultural heritage studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PCCHC&rsquo;s defined mandate is to preside over the guardianship of the historical and artistic patrimony of the local church in the Philippines. It exercises this mandate by promoting the ecclesiastical cultural heritage as an invaluable aid to evangelization and catechesis, fomenting research on and understanding of the ecclesiastical cultural properties, initiating and sustaining collaboration between the CBCP and parallel government agencies and nongovernment institutions involved in the care, conservation, and appreciation of the ecclesiastical cultural patrimony, and undertaking projects in different ecclesiastical territories in the country upon invitation or authorization of and collaboration with the diocesan bishops concerned (CBCP 2000). PCCHC also liaises with the Holy See&rsquo;s Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church (Benedict XVI 2000) to assure &ldquo;a harmonization of objectives and fruitful and reciprocal collaboration&rdquo; (John Paul II 1993).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presence of PCCHC as an institutional legation of the CBCP in the National Committee on Monuments and Sites of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts led to the preparation and realization of the Holy See&ndash;Republic of the Philippines Agreement on the Cultural Heritage of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, an international accord entered into by the Vatican and the Philippines in 2007, and made effective the following year by which the two sovereign entities commit to cooperate for the conservation of identified tangible cultural heritage resources of the Church in the Philippines (Papal Secretariat 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the Permanent Committee&rsquo;s enduring activities is its biennial National Convention of Church Cultural Heritage Practitioners first held in the Diocese of Tagbilaran, Bohol, in 1999. Serving as a venue for continuing education in this specialized pastoral field, the said convention gathers all administrators, curators, and workers of church heritage all over the Philippine Catholic Church once every two years. Proceedings of the biennial national conventions are published in <strong><em>Pintacasi</em></strong>, the annual journal devoted to the study of the cultural heritage of the Catholic Church in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the projects completed by the PCCHC is the writing of a handbook for the proper documentation of church property and the restoration of heritage buildings following the methods of construction appropriate to the building and its construction. The PCCHC has been active in collaborating with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2683\"><strong> <strong><strong>National  <strong>Historical</strong> Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</strong> </strong> </strong></a> and the  <strong><strong> <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> in documenting and restoring church-related buildings. With NHCP assistance, it worked on the restoration of the Balilihan watchtower / bell tower in Bohol. When a number of the churches listed by the National Museum as national cultural treasures were damaged by the earthquake of Oct 2013 and by typhoon Yolanda in 2014, the PCCHC worked with the appropriate government agencies to protect the damaged properties and through the parishes gathered volunteers to help in the recovery, sorting, and documentation of pieces of the damaged churches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of problems may be considered obstacles to the proper preservation and protection of church heritage. For one, the legal owner of church property in the Philippines is the territorial bishop. Therefore, the PCCHC, being a national body, does not have absolute control over any church property. A bishop can decide against all objections to do what he thinks best. This has happened in many places where the bishop, through the parish priest, authorized the construction of new buildings that marred the original layout of a colonial-period church. In some cases, the timely intervention of heritage and civic groups and exposure to media, more than the PCCHC, succeeded in stopping such ill-advised initiatives. Moreover, some parish priests have also been instrumental in defacing heritage structures for lack of knowledge about the value of heritage structures. Ironically, some have even resorted to selling church artifacts to raise funds for the maintenance of their heritage sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full protection of such heritage structures faces multiple difficulties and requires multiple solutions. Among these are lack of funds for the maintenance of heritage structures and the lack of formal training or ongoing professional education in matters of culture, art, and heritage conservation among the clergy. Furthermore, the handbook on documentation and conservation of PCCHC is not well known.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Mil&aacute;n Ted D.

In addition, her art criticism hewed closely to the formalist method in vogue in the late 1950s to mid-1970s, privileging Philippine expressionists and abstractionists in her critical writings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">She received the Outstanding Book Award from the National Academy of Sciences and Technology in 1999 for her work <b><i>The Philippine Senate</i></b>.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong> <strong><strong>Imelda</strong> Cajipe-Endaya</strong> </strong></a> and Reuben Ramas Ca&ntilde;ete</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"></p>\r\n"

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>CULTURAL CENTER OF THE PHILIPPINES</b><b> </b>(<b>CCP</b>) The CCP is the leading institution in the country that plans and implements programs for the development and promotion of the arts&mdash;music, dance, theater, visual, literary, cinematic, and broadcast arts. Since 1969 when it was created by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos, it has sponsored programs and activities such as festivals, exhibitions, competitions, and publications to preserve, promote, and enhance the artistic and cultural heritage of the Filipino people, and to develop audiences that will appreciate and support artistic and cultural work. It is home to nine resident companies that present regular seasons of productions, workshops, and outreach performances: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong> <strong><strong>Ballet</strong> Philippines</strong> </strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\"><strong>Bayanihan Philippine National</strong><strong>FolkDance</strong>  <strong>Company</strong></a>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine Ballet Theatre</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\"><strong>Tanghalang Pilipino</strong></a></strong>, and UST Symphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitting on a 60-hectare complex on Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, the CCP is part of a vast international network of arts and culture organizations that provide exchange opportunities between Filipino artists and artists from all over the world. This network also brings in performances and exhibitions that allow local audiences to experience arts and cultures from elsewhere. These organizations include the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Center, the Conseil International des Organisations de Festivals de Folklore et d&rsquo;Arts Traditionnels, the World Dance Alliance, the International Theater Institute, the Asian Theater Alliance, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, and the ASEAN&ndash;Korea Traditional Music Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is composed of several departments that promote arts education, direct outreach and exchange programs all over the country, mount productions and exhibitions, manage cultural holdings, and develop its assets. In its first two decades the CCP focused on what were later perceived as elitist performing arts&mdash;theater, ballet, opera, and similar shows&mdash;a bias that was shaped by its first board of trustees chair, then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos. Following the successful EDSA revolt against Marcos and his martial rule and the subsequent change in the country&rsquo;s leadership, the CCP expanded its scope to include literature, film, and broadcast arts, among others. It also reoriented its direction to emphasize original Filipino artistic and cultural expressions rooted in the Philippines and the participation of the regions in the definition of a national culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music. </b>The CCP is home to the country&rsquo;s premier symphonic orchestra, the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO). Established in 1973, the PPO (then known as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra) initially accompanied local and foreign performing artists at the CCP. It later evolved as one of the best music ensembles in the Asia-Pacific region, premiering works by Filipino and foreign composers, and promoting music appreciation throughout the country. Past conductors and musical directors of the PPO include  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\"><strong>Luis Valencia</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\"><strong>Oscar Yatco</strong></a></strong>, Ruggero Barbieri, Olivier Ochanine, and Yoshikazu Fukumura.Among the internationally renowned conductors who have performed with the PPO are Mendi Rodan, Piero Gamba, Enrique Batis, Sebastian Bereau, and Nicholas Koch. Some of the world&rsquo;s best Filipino and foreign artists have also performed with the PPO, including Van Cliburn, Renata Tebaldi, Judith Engel, Anthony Camden, David Benoit,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\"><strong>Cecile Licad</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Lea Salonga</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>. The PPO is now on its 34th concert season. It has toured in Europe, Asia, and more recently, the United States, when it performed for the first time at the Carnegie Hall. Aside from its regular concert seasons at the CCP, the PPO also participates in the CCP Outreach Program by performing in public spaces and conducting workshops in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another resident company of the CCP is the Philippine Madrigal Singers. Organized in 1963 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\"><strong>Andrea O. Veneracion</strong></a>, later National Artist for music, the choir is composed of students, teachers, and alumni from the various colleges of the University of the Philippines. Performing a wide repertoire of various styles and forms, the ensemble has consistently won all the top prizes in most of the world&rsquo;s prestigious choral competitions. The choir also maintains an active outreach and concert schedule every year and is regarded as one of the country&rsquo;s most active ambassadors of goodwill and one of the world&rsquo;s most traveled choirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UST Symphony Orchestra is also a resident performing group of the CCP. It holds regular concerts at the CCP and participates in the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program. It also serves as a pool for additional players as the needs of the PPO dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, the CCP launched the <b><i>Filipino Artists Series</i></b> (FAS), a monthly program featuring solo performances of acclaimed and emerging Filipino musical artists. Among those featured in the FAS were bass baritone Jonathan Zaens; flutist  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4057\"><strong>Antonio Maigue</strong></a></strong>; cellist Wilfredo Pasamba; pianists Corazon Kabayao, Mariel Illusorio, Peter Porticos, and Rene Dalandan; violinists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Gilopez Kabayao</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>, Gina Medina, and Denise Huang; and sopranos Clarissa Ocampo and Maria Cristina Viguilla-Navarro. FAS was discontinued in 2009 but was later revived in 2012 as the <b><i>Special Concert Series</i></b>. Some of the performing artists in this series are pianist Charisse Baldoria, soprano Katrina Saporsantos, cellist Antoni Josef Inacay, trumpet player Raymond de Leon, percussionist Aimee Mina dela Cruz, and flutist Sarah Mae Gabuyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP also embarked on the production of Filipino operas as well as Western operas that were adapted to a Philippine setting. In 1970, it partnered with the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> in producing <b><i><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong> </i></b> (Subversion), the operatic adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong> <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </strong></a>&rsquo;s novel, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3965\"><strong>Felipe Padilla de Leon</strong></a> and libretto by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a></strong>. De Leon and Tolentino&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> </a>(Touch Me Not), first staged at the FEU Auditorium in 1957, was also restaged at the CCP in 1974, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3956\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Don David</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a> as Ibarra,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4158\"><strong>Ruby Salazar</strong></a></strong> as Maria Clara, Jimmy Melendres as Padre Damaso, and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\"><strong>Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</strong></a></strong> as Sisa. In 1984, the CCP and Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines commissioned  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\"><strong>Francisco Feliciano</strong></a></strong> to create the three-act opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a></i></b> (The Black She-wolf), with libretto by Cuyugan-Asensio. In 1987, the CCP partnered with Music Theater Foundation in another restaging of <b><i>Noli&hellip;</i></b> this time with  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3920\"><strong>Nolyn Cabahug</strong></a></strong> as Ibarra,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3982\"><strong>Andion Fernandez</strong></a></strong> as Maria Clara, and Cuyugan-Asensio as Sisa (alternating with Luz Morete). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\"><strong>Rolando Tinio</strong></a>&rsquo;s Philippine adaptation of <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> and <b><i>La Boheme</i></b> were also produced by and staged at the CCP in 1991 and 1992, respectively.

In recognition of the broad reach and powerful influence of radio and television, the CCP established in 1987 a Coordinating Center for Broadcast Arts which was one of the units of the then Visual, Literary, and Media Arts Department. While all these units have been replaced by the Media Arts Division, the CCP&mdash;then and now&mdash;has continued efforts to equip ordinary citizens with the skills to produce radio programs and videos that reflect their realities and that allow them to promote their sectoral interests through broadcasting. It conducts hands-on training-workshops on radio and television production and scriptwriting, accepts apprenticeships, and awards production grants. While bringing its training program to as far north as Batanes and as far south as Tawi-tawi, the CCP encourages the use of Filipino languages in the programs and videos produced by its trainees. Among those who complete the training programs and are given grants to produce their own radio programs are farmers, fisherfolk, social development and cultural workers, students, and local leaders who produce and host talk shows, historical documentaries, instructional programs, public service announcements, music shows, and dramatizations of Filipino myths and legends. Their productions are aired in cooperation with local radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP produces television programs as well as videos.

		"text": "<p><strong>DE CISCARA</strong><strong>, JUAN</strong> ( <strong>Juan Ramirez de Ciscara</strong> )b. Santiago de Chile17 Apr 1671. d. between 1719 and 1732. Military engineer. His parents were Juan de Ciscara Yba&ntilde;ez and Maria Candelaria Ramirez. The older De Ciscara was a military engineer who worked on the fortification of Havana in 1670. Juan followed in his father&rsquo;s footsteps. His career began as a soldier in Yucatan, Mexico, where he served for a year and three months. By 1692 he had moved to Havana, but despite an official recommendation he was unable to find employment as a military engineer. Back in Mexico, he was appointed assistant engineer under Jaime Franck in 1694.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demonstrating great competence and enthusiasm, he was promoted to the rank of captain of the infantry in 1695. He was commissioned to examine and propose plans for the fortification of the Barlovento Islands. While his work won the approval of the viceroy, De Ciscara requested to retire from military service but was denied because of lack of military engineers. After years of service, he succeeded Franck in supervising the works on the fortification of Santa Maria de Galve. He was awarded honorary rank of<em>sargento mayor</em>(sergeant major). Another request for retirement in 1702 due to health was granted for a period of four months after which he was called to active service. In Dec 1704, he was assigned to supervise construction at Fort San Diego in Acapulco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following year he was in the Philippines, the first military engineer to be sent to the islands, which needed a professional very badly. In Oct 1705, he was busy planning the fortifications of Cavite. He returned to Mexico where in 1713 he replaced Juan Bautista Mazoni as chief engineer. He returned to the Philippines in Jul 1717, accompanied by two servants: Ignacio de la Cruz, a Filipino, and Juan de Irigoyen, a Navarrese. As soon as he arrived, he checked on the progress at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a> and the walls. Very little is heard about him until a letter from Gov-Gen Fernando Valdes Tamon, addressed to the king and dated 4 Jul 1732, asked to send a military engineer, for there was no one in Manila. Presumably, De Ciscara had died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Ciscara worked on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/301\"><strong>Fort San Pedro</strong></a> in Cebu and Fort Santiago in Manila and the rebuilding of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\"><strong>Fort Pilar</strong></a>, whose plans he drew in 1719. He also worked on nonmilitary structures like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>, the church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, the Seminario de San Clemente, and the <strong>convento</strong> (parish house) of San Juan de Dios de Manila, &ldquo;of which there remain only drawings&rdquo; (Luengo 2013). The Dominican provincial, Fr Pedro de Mejorada, asked him to design a chapel for Our Lady of the Rosary, which he provided without any monetary incentive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three drawings for the Philippines that De Ciscara made have survived: iconography of the Castle of Santiago, 1714, a proposal for the repair and rehabilitation of Fort Santiago; plan for the Cebu cathedral, 1719; and a map of the Fort of Our Lady of Pilar<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\"><strong> </strong></a>in Zamboanga, 1719. The plan for the Cebu cathedral is unusual for its <strong>coro baxo</strong> or <strong>bajo</strong>, a choir stall in the middle of the nave, similar to those found in Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reconstruction of the Cebu cathedral was long delayed. Although royal approval was granted on 27 Oct 1670, the project did not progress much. With the arrival of a new bishop, Fr Miguel Bayot, the construction of the cathedral went on in earnest. Foundations were laid. But with the death of Bishop Bayot, not only was the cathedral left half done but a violent typhoon destroyed what had been built and the cathedral was left in ruins. The new bishop, Foronda, who took over the Diocese of Cebu in 1719, started a new project to build the cathedral. He sent the new plan made by De Ciscara to Manila. However, Manila considered the plan as too grand and more appropriate for a capital, and Cebu did not have the necessary expertise to work on the cathedral. By the time construction on the cathedral got under way in 1735, De Ciscara&rsquo;s plan was set aside.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

De Escondrillas was a government functionary who served the Obras Publicas or Public Works offices in Cebu in the mid-19th century. He acted both as architect designing new structures and engineer inspecting churches and public buildings. His area of responsibility included all of Cebu and the adjacent island of Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His name first appears in a project for the fortification for Tagbilaran, Bohol, in 1855. The sketch for this project is kept in the National Archives or the Records Management and Archives Office. It shows a quadrilateral two-story watchtower with a roof. Its walls have small openings for rifles. De Escondrillas made plans for Talibon church in 1858. It seems he was fond of this project because he signed &ldquo;DE&rdquo; over the door of sacristy. He inspected <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/322\"><strong>Loboc Church</strong></a> in 1864.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the National Archives is a plan for Tagbilaran, signed &ldquo;Tagbilaran, Domingo de Escondrillas.&rdquo; He directed the construction of a church in Dumanjug, Cebu. Construction began around 1854 and finished in 1864. It was commissioned by the bishop of Cebu, Romualdo Jimeno, OP, while Filipino secular priests, Frs Matias Cabrera and Doroteo Gordinez, were parish priests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Escondrillas&rsquo;s well-known work, considered the best and grandest church built by the Recollects, is the Church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Luz in Loon, Bohol. Church construction was begun in 1855 and completed in 1864.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/323\"><strong>Loon Church</strong></a></strong> was completely demolished by the earthquake of 15 Oct 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Escondrillas established the first printing press in Cebu in 1873, but it seems to have lasted only two years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another well-known work of Escondrillas is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/281\"><strong>Carcel de Cebu</strong></a>. This was planned as the provincial jail for Cebu. It was designed beginning 1869 and construction started ca 1871. Completed most likely in 1878, additional structures were added in 1892. The jail is presently Museo Sugbo or the Cebu Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Escondrillas designed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/356\"><strong>Church of Santo Tomas de Villanueva </strong></a>in Pardo, Cebu. The church was built from 1890 to 1893. The church facade has two towers flanking the central section that terminates in a pyramidal roof.

		"text": "<p><strong>DE UGUCCIONI, JUAN</strong> ( <strong>Giovanni Maria de Uguccioni</strong> ) b. Florence ca 1704. Active 1750-65. Priest-architect. A native of Florence, Italy, he was a secular priest who belonged to the Cajetan or Theatine Order. He descended from the Uguccioni family who were influential in Florence since the 16th century. He most likely had an education in his hometown, where classical taste persisted while the baroque was already flourishing in other Italian cities. After Florence, he went to Rome, where he may have come in contact with the baroque, although at this time there were no monumental baroque works being built yet. His architectural style, classicism with a mild touch of baroque, may be explained by his Florentine roots as modified by his Roman formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1709, the fathers of the Propaganda Fidei in Goa sent petitions to Rome asking for missionaries. All who arrived in Goa were Italians. He worked as a missionary in Bengkulu, Indonesia, where between 1709 and 1719 he assisted in building Fort York, later called Fort Marlborough, for the English. The fort did not last long because in 1719 the native population burnt it. He was in Goa by Jan 1723 where he remained until 1736. He used Goa as a base to travel elsewhere, like Borneo. While at Goa, he wrote a history of his order, <strong><em>Noticia das Missoes dos Clerigos Regulares na India Oriental</em></strong> (Report on the Missions of the Regular Clergy in East India). Architect Esteban de Rojas y Melo, who worked on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\"><strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></a>, affirms that De Uguccioni worked in Goa for three decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1750, while en route to Goa, De Uguccioni passed by the Philippines without the necessary license. He had been an engineer for the British on the coast of Malabar while serving as missionary of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. His stay in the Philippines was brief and unplanned but was seen as providential, because an engineer was needed by the archbishop of Manila. Earlier, a committee assessing the ruinous state of the Manila Cathedral, which had undergone several typhoons and earthquakes, recommended that the structure be pulled down and one stronger and with better proportions be built. But there was no competent architect who could plan and supervise the rebuilding of the cathedral. Convened by Abp Juan Angel Rodriguez, OST, Abp 1731-42, the committee members who worked on the proposal for a new cathedral were Fr Joaquin Mezquita, SJ, said to be well versed in architecture; Antonio Gonzales de Quijano; and Tomas de Castro y Andrade. The petition to rebuild was sent to the king and was answered by a royal cedula requesting for plans and a budget for the cathedral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, the archbishop of Manila, Pedro Martinez Arizala, Abp 1744-55, persuaded De Uguccioni to take on the task of architect and overseer for the reconstruction of the Manila Cathedral. Corroborating the earlier assessment, De Uguccioni recommended complete demolition, but due to lack of funds, he had to build upon the remaining walls of the cathedral. He was assisted by Esteban de Rojas y Melo as <strong>obrero mayor</strong> (supervisor of construction). De Rojas, born in Llata, Peru, was ordained subdeacon in Nueva Caceres or Naga on 1 Oct 1736, and had been secretary of the bishops and member of the Cathedral canons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Uguccioni patterned the cathedral&rsquo;s facade after the Il Gesu in Rome. Begun in 1751, the Manila Cathedral was not yet completely finished when it was inaugurated in 1760 by Abp Manuel Antonio Rojo y Viera, Arizala&rsquo;s successor. De Uguccioni became the favored architect of the church and state during the reign of Abp Rojo del Rio, Abp 1758-64, who became acting governor of the Philippines in 1761. The archbishop commissioned De Uguccioni to propose repairs on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a>. In the same year he was sent to Cavite Puerto to find solutions to the flooding of the port city, built so close to the sea. Later he was asked to propose repairs for the Colegio de Santa Potenciana, organized for the education of the daughters of soldiers, and the buildings of the Seminario Conciliar de San Clemente, where De Uguccioni worked with the<em>sangley</em>(Chinese) stone mason Jeronimo Tongco. He worked closely with other Chinese artisans, employing Juan Ingco, master mason and carpenter, in the repair of the Hospital Real in Manila.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

He was the son of Luis Espina and Perpetua Cortes. His wife, the late Filomena Perez-Espina, 1917-88, was an architect. Four of their eight children are architects. He graduated with a bachelor of science degree in architecture, 1937, from the Mapua Institute of Technology. He worked under  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\"><strong>Tomas Mapua</strong></a></strong> in 1937, and with the Corps of Engineers of the United States&ndash;Philippine Army, 1937-42, and 1945, in Manila, Corregidor, and Cebu. In the post-World War II years, he was an architectural designer with the H. Franco and J. L. Panis construction companies of Cebu, 1946-50. In 1951, he took first place in the government examinations for architects, founding the architectural firm Espina and Perez-Espina Associates as a single proprietorship of two principals, his wife and himself, in the same year. He taught at the University of San Carlos, 1951-76.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Espina went on architectural observation tours in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, 1976-89.

He was also involved in the restoration of the Basilica del Santo Ni&ntilde;o in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The partnership that Cristobal and his wife established has flourished as an important architectural firm in Cebu. In the 1980s, the firm established a Manila office. Omar Maxwell Espina, Fina Daphne Espina, and Joseph Michael Espina manage the Cebu office, while Cristopher Stonewall Espina and Mary Ann Ara&ntilde;as-Espina the Manila branch. Continuing the partnership&rsquo;s legacy, the firm has been involved in diverse architectural disciplines, like architecture, engineering, urban and regional planning, landscape architecture, and interior design. It created the site development plan of Sacred Heart School (Ateneo de Cebu) in Mandaue City and the University of San Carlos College of Architecture and Fine Arts in collaboration with architects Maria Lizeta Uy and Sergio Raagas Jr. It did the landscape for Fort Bonifacio, Lakeshore, Subic Holiday Villas, and the Medical City.

With these works, he began his Formal and Spatial Pattern series in painting, sculpture, and architecture through which he worked on various theories, principles, and methods involved in the organization of forms and spaces. In an open setting, Fernandez&rsquo;s sculpture assumes the character of lines in oriental calligraphy interacting with the surrounding space. Also in regard of the figure-space theme is a series made of bands and wire mesh which are curved, twisted, or folded in order to bring out the values of plasticity and flexibility. Space interpenetrates into the figure and around it in these pieces. In later works, the metal planes are cut into basic figurative shapes, painted in various hues, and lightly treated with acid for textural interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UP College of Architecture launched in 2006 the Honrado R.

Fernandez took up architecture at the University of Santo Tomas. As a student, he excelled in architectural rendering. In 1952, he worked as art director in the Civil Affairs Office of the Department of National Defense. From 1953 to 1955 he was head of design in the Decor Arts Department of Aguinaldo&rsquo;s Echague, the premier furniture store of the country at the time, which pioneered in interior design. In 1956, he established the Wili Fernandez Design Studio, of which he was head designer. In 1964, he founded Wili Fernandez and Associates Inc, of which he was president and chief designer. In 1980, he became a partner in Anjo Designs Ltd, Hong Kong. He was a founding member and past president of the Philippine Institute of Interior Designers (PIID), and later, member of its board of directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fernandez designed interiors for hotels, restaurants, offices, banks, airline offices, showrooms, clubhouses, resorts, clinics, and residences. His major projects include the interiors of 18 hotels in the Philippines and in Hong Kong, Taipei, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and Bangkok, as well as the interiors of the Philippine House in Hong Kong, Tokyo, Sydney, New York, and Madrid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While his style is basically contemporary, he uses native Filipino motifs, such as Maranao designs, and color schemes evocative of Filipino folk art. His interiors are characterized by richness, cosmopolitan sophistication, and restful urbanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He wrote a number of articles on interior design, such as &ldquo;Design Problems in Asia&rdquo; for <strong><em>The Asia Magazine</em></strong>, 1965; &ldquo;Asian Hotel Design&rdquo; for <strong><em>Asian Construction</em></strong>, 1973; and &ldquo;Professionalism in Interior Design&rdquo; for <strong><em>The Asian Builder</em></strong>, 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1985, the PIID awarded Fernandez a Fellowship Plaque &ldquo;for his contribution to the field of interior design, as architect, interior designer, and furniture designer; for having paved the way for the acceptance and recognition of interior design as a profession in this country; for having personified the true designer, practising the profession consistently and with the highest standards of taste for the past twenty years.&rdquo; In 1988, the city of Manila conferred on him the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award.

The son of Gregorio Formoso and Alvara Papa, he finished high school at Ateneo de Manila in 1933, then enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas School of Architecture where he graduated in 1937. Becoming a registered architect in 1939, he worked for  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a></strong> and later for  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\"><strong>Pablo Antonio</strong></a></strong>. He formed a partnership with  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\"><strong>Luis Araneta</strong></a></strong>, then established his own office. From 1952 to 1988, he made 11 tours of the United States, South America, and Europe to observe trends in architecture, particularly in bank, hotel, and condominium design. Formoso, a fellow of the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2705\"><strong>United Architects of the Philippines (UAP)</strong></a></strong>, was the founding chairman of the Kanlungan Architectural Foundation of the Philippines, organized by UAP fellows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In more than 40 years of practice, he designed about 80 buildings and more than 150 residences. His outstanding works include the Central Bank complex, 1970, and the Metropolitan Museum, 1973, both on Roxas Blvd, Manila; the Valley Golf Club in Victoria Valley, Antipolo, Rizal, 1960; the Alabang Golf and Country Club in Alabang, Muntinlupa, 1978; the Development Academy of the Philippines in Tagaytay City, 1974; and the Club Filipino in Greenhills, San Juan, 1960. His buildings in Makati include the Pacific Star Building on Makati Ave, 1990; the Bank of America&ndash;Lepanto Building on Paseo de Roxas, 1978; the Nikko Manila Garden Hotel on EDSA, 1974; the Manila Peninsula Hotel on Ayala Ave, 1974; the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) on Paseo de Roxas, 1970; and the Do&ntilde;a Narcisa de Leon Building on Paseo de Roxas, 1967.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some of Formoso&rsquo;s buildings are characterized by cool elegance, others are notable for their warmth and ruggedness. The Pacific Star Building, with its towering arches and classic lines, is remarkable for its refinement and serenity. The Central Bank Buildings are a harmonious composition of massive concrete blocks relieved of their severity by continuous horizontal bands of windows. Wooden panels, rugged stonework, and bold concrete masses give the exterior of the AIM both warmth and virility. The wooden panels evoke the <strong>bandeja</strong> (traylike) panels of the<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a>(house of stone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement on his philosophy of design, Formoso emphasizes three points: first, architecture is a fine art committed to creating beauty; second, the social nature of architecture places a unique responsibility on the architect&mdash;that is, a building becomes part of the environment and functions in a dynamic interaction with it; and third, architecture must strive for simplicity. While his work faithfully reflects his philosophy, it is further characterized by a sensitivity to native tradition. This is especially evident in his residences, with their steep hip roofs and elegant woodwork. Formoso set a trend in the Club Filipino in Greenhills, which paid homage to the bahay na bato and affirmed the continuing relevance of certain traditional forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1977, Formoso received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. In 1990, the UAP conferred on him its highest honor, the Likha Award and Gold Medal of Merit. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

Quezon City 2 Sep 1955. Essayist, teacher. He is one of the six children of Remedios Trota and Regalado San Luis Jose, a concert pianist, music teacher, and orchestra conductor. He received his education, from elementary to postgraduate studies, at the University of the Philippines, obtaining a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in anthropology in 1978 and master of arts in Philippine studies in 1991. Jose&rsquo;s education expanded as well through concerts all over the country and the world with the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a></strong> (1974-83). He obtained a certificate in Madrid from the Spanish Ministry of Education for an introductory course on the sources of viceregal art in 2000. At present, he is a faculty member of the Cultural Heritage Studies Program of the University of Santo Tomas Graduate School and an archivist of the same university. He previously taught at the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3812\"><strong>University of the Philippines Department of Art Studies</strong></a></strong> in the 1990s. He served as chair of the Committees of Archives, Museums, and Monuments and Sites from 2012 to 2014, commissioner of the Subcommission on Cultural Heritage of the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a></strong> from 2011 to 2013. He was a founding member and first president of the International Council on Monuments and Sites Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For almost 13 years, since 1979, Jose worked at the Ayala Museum, starting as arts researcher and eventually becoming curator two years before he resigned. During this period, he was able to further advance his studies on Philippine colonial church arts. From his documentation field trips, he expanded the museum&rsquo;s Iconographic Archive, especially its collection of photos and slides of churches; started a study collection of bricks from colonial structures; and built up a store of data from field and archival sources on colonial art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jose has been advocating for the study, protection, and conservation of the cultural heritage of the Catholic Church in the country. He has worked on research projects, curatorial works for exhibits, lectures, and seminars for the Ayala Museum, University of the Philippines, University of Santo Tomas, Philippine National Historical Society, National Commission for Culture and the Arts, Manila Archdiocesan Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2645\"><strong>Catholic Bishops&rsquo; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) Episcopal Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church</strong></a>. His research works have provided the study of Philippine colonial church art and architecture with tools for a more scientific learning of Philippine art. His works and recommendations led to the inscription of a number of Philippine churches in the UNESCO World Heritage List and the National Cultural Treasures list of the  <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\"><strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jose helped set up museums as well as curated a number of exhibits in the country and abroad.

The exhibitions helped refine knowledge and connoisseurship on Filipino-Hispanic art and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jose&rsquo;s writings revolve around the objects of his research. The culmination of his earlier work is<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/9/412\"><strong><em><strong>Simbahan</strong> : Church Art in Colonial Philippines, 1565-1898</em></strong></a>, which was published in 1991 by the Ayala Museum.

		"text": "<p><strong>KLASSEN</strong><strong>, WINAND</strong> ( <strong>Winand Becker Klassen</strong> )<strong></strong>b. Kettenkamp Municipality, Osnabruck District, Germany 29 Jan 1930. Architect, teacher, scholar of architecture.His parents are August Klassen and Helene Becker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Fr Winand Klassen arrived in 1976 to teach architecture in the University of San Carlos in Cebu City, he had come well prepared for the job. As a youth, he labored in a construction site for six years. In 1951, he joined the Society of the Divine Word (SVD), studied for the priesthood in his native Germany and in the United States where he was ordained in 1963, then worked with an institution of SVD architects in Rome. As he steadily appraised the world of the architect through constant traveling around the country and through attending practitioners&rsquo;s conventions, Klassen proceeded to arm his students and colleagues by writing a series of books. These were <strong><em>History of Western Architecture</em></strong>, 1980;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/9/399\"><strong><em>Architecture in the Philippines</em></strong></a>, 1986, and reprinted in 2010; <strong><em>Architecture and Philosophy</em></strong>, 1990; and <strong><em>Architecture Gods and Mortals</em></strong>, 1994. All four were published by the University of San Carlos. Klassen also disseminated his views through articles in the <strong><em>Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society</em></strong> and through talks sponsored by the Goethe-Institut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>History</em></strong><strong><em>of Western Architecture</em></strong> is developed through a presentation of about 200 examples, each with a brief sketch of its historical background, architectural form, and interpreted meaning.<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/9/399\"><strong><em>Architecture in the Philippines</em></strong></a>is a virtual summation of all that was known then about the subject, with the added bonus of critical analyses not only of structures but of contemporary architects, architects&rsquo; associations, and architecture in Cebu. In <strong><em>Architecture and Philosophy</em></strong>, Klassen wrestles with philosophies that inform architectural thought, dialoguing not only with Thomism and active negativism but especially with phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. These ideas are dealt with more deeply in <strong><em>Architecture Gods and Mortals</em></strong>, but this time with the express aim of moving the architect to keep on searching for meaning, thereby committing himself to build better architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collectively, the four-volume set is arguably the best textbook for Philippine architects to date. To be sure, his book on Western architecture contains far less examples than the classic <strong><em>A History of Architecture</em></strong> by Sir Banister Fletcher, revised several times and still used by many schools, including state universities. The volume on Philippine architecture was written just before the EDSA Revolt, and certainly needs to be updated. However, Klassen&rsquo;s prickly critiques and informed interpretations are invaluable in forming a young architect. Though the last two books are geared toward critical and ethical thinking, still they are free from the jargon and oblique statements that would plague later authors. Alone among his colleagues, Klassen rails againt kitsch&mdash;low quality material designed to appeal to current popular taste&mdash;a plea that runs through his four books. In being well illustrated with architectural and technical drawings, elevations, plans, cross sections, and site plans, Klassen&rsquo;s contributions remain unsurpassed by later works published in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with Arch Artemio S. Alcoseba, Klassen designed the church of Saint Arnold Janssen and Saint Joseph Freinademetz in the Talamban Campus of the University of San Carlos, 1984, and the San Vicente Ferrer parish church also in Cebu City, toward 1990. These structures are examples of Klassen&rsquo;s melding of local values with modern lines. One of his students, Arch Melva Rodriguez Java, has carried on his ideals into the field of heritage architecture conservation. Unfortunately, Klassen&rsquo;s works are hardly known beyond Cebu as they are not cited in local and foreign scholars&rsquo;s bibliographies.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong> </strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Klassen, Winand. 1978. &ldquo;Towards a Philippine Architecture.&rdquo; <i>Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society</i> 6 (4): 218-27.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. 1980. <i>The Architecture of the Philippines</i>.

		"text": "<p><strong>LOCSIN, LEANDRO V.</strong> ( <strong>Leandro Valencia Locsin</strong> ) aka Lindy Locsin. b. Silay, Negros Occidental 15 Aug 1928. d. Makati City 15 Nov 1994. National Artist for Architecture. The eldest of Guillermo Locsin and Remedios Valencia&rsquo;s seven children, Locsin was named after his paternal grandfather Leandro de la Rama Locsin, who was the first elected governor of Negros Occidental under the American regime. He was married to Cecilia Yulo. They had two children, one of whom, Leandro Jr, is an architect. After finishing high school at De La Salle College in Manila in 1947, Locsin enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Conservatory of Music, intending to pursue music as a career, although he was even then interested in architecture. In 1949, he dropped the bachelor of music course and enrolled at the UST School of Architecture. While an architecture student, he worked as an artist-draftsman at the Ayala Corporation, which was then beginning the development of Makati. He graduated in 1953, and is one of very few major architects who did not train abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before establishing his practice, he designed stage sets for ballets and a musical. In 1954, Fr John Delaney, SJ, the University of the Philippines (UP) Catholic chaplain, commissioned him to design the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice</a></strong> at the UP Diliman campus. Completed in 1955, the building was remarkable for its circular plan and three-inch thick concrete-shell dome. Within the next four years he designed an apartment building, two office buildings, and nine residences&mdash;a small number that nonetheless created an impact on the architectural scene. From 1955 to 1994, Locsin produced 75 residences, 88 buildings, and a state palace. The buildings include 11 churches and chapels, 23 government buildings, 4 apartment buildings, 6 hotels, and 48 commercial buildings. While his best-known works are located in Metro Manila, he also designed buildings in Dagupan, Cabanatuan, Batangas City, Naga, Bacolod, Iloilo, Tacloban, Mandaue, Cagayan de Oro, Ozamis, and Davao City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin&rsquo;s major accomplishments include the buildings at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong>  <strong>Complex</strong></a>&mdash;the main building housing two theaters, a museum, and art galleries, 1969; the Folk Arts Theater, 1974; the Philippine Center for International Trade and Exhibitions or PHILCITE, 1976; the Philippine International Convention Center, 1976; and the Philippine Plaza Hotel, 1976. Other major works include the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Roxas Blvd, Pasay City, 1967; the Makati Stock Exchange Building, 1971, and the Ayala Museum (now replaced by another designed by his son), 1974, both on Makati Ave, Makati; the renovation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, 1976; the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Makati, 1976; the National Arts Center at Makiling, Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, 1976; and the terminal of the Manila International Airport (now Ninoy Aquino International Airport), 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His largest and most spectacular work was the Istana Nurul Iman (Palace of the Light of Faith), the palace of the sultan of Brunei, which has a total floor area of 200,000 sq m, a grand reception hall accommodating 5,000, a throne room with a capacity of 2,000, and two mosques crowned by domes plated with 22-carat gold. Malayan and Islamic motifs, modern lines, and the latest building technology blend. With clean lines, strong masses, and daring structural design, Locsin&rsquo;s buildings are strikingly modern and original. But touches of nostalgia, the use of traditional forms and patterns, and the sculptural character of space and structure give his work a romantic spirit. His last work was the Church of the Monastery of the Transfiguration in Malaybalay, Bukidnon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1975, Locsin was commissioned by American dancer Martha Graham to design the sets for <strong><em>Lucifer</em></strong> and <strong><em>Adorations</em></strong>, which she created to mark the golden jubilee of her renowned modern dance company. Locsin and his wife co-authored <strong><em>Oriental Ceramics Discovered in the Philippines</em></strong>, 1967.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin and his work are the subject of <strong><em>The</em></strong><strong><em>Architecture of  <strong><strong> <strong><strong>Leandro V. Locsin</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </em></strong> by Nicholas Polites, published by John Weatherhill in 1977. He is the only Filipino architect included in <strong><em>Contemporary Architects</em></strong>, edited by Muriel Emmanuel, published in 1980, and <strong><em>Architects of the Third World</em></strong> by Udo Kultermann, published in 1980. He and his work have been featured in various architectural and popular magazines. In commemoration of his second death anniversary, the Cultural Center of the Philippines mounted an exhibit on Locsin&rsquo;s three major works titled <strong><em>The Poet of Space: Leandro V. Locsin</em></strong>, which ran from Nov 1996 to Feb 1997. It was also accompanied by a publication of the same title, which featured the Istana Nurul Iman, the Ayala Triangle Tower One and the Philippine Stock Exchange, and the Church of the Monastery of the Transfiguration. Architects Augusto Villalon and Rodrigo D. Perez III curated the exhibit and edited and wrote for the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1959, he received the Ten Outstanding Young Men award for architecture. In 1961, the American Institute of Architects Hawaii Chapter conferred on him the Pan-Pacific Citation for consistent excellence in design.

He was the son of the painter  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a></strong> (Juan Luna de San Pedro) and Paz Pardo de Tavera. He married Grace V. McCrae. With his father and his uncle  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\"><strong>Antonio Luna</strong></a></strong>, the young Luna came home to Manila in 1894. Luna&rsquo;s early schooling was at Ateneo de Manila. He took art lessons under  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\"><strong>Miguel Zaragoza</strong></a></strong>, then came under the tutelage of Ramon Santa Coloma and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\"><strong>Lorenzo Guerrero</strong></a></strong>. Although Luna wanted to become a painter like his father, the latter advised him to be an architect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He studied ceramics in Japan, then returned to Manila and took the course in architecture in the International Correspondence School. The school granted him a diploma in 1911. The following year he went to Paris, France, and studied under Charles Gilardi, artist and builder; then he enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and worked in the office of Paulin, a French architect. In 1918, he was recognized as an<em>architect diplome</em>by the French government. He worked in the office of Emil Bertoner, a government architect. He was admitted into the Societe Centrale des Architectes Francais.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving as architect of the city of Manila, 1920-24, he went into private practice and trained young Filipino architects who worked under him. Luna served as president of the Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA) in its early years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although schooled in the academic and revivalist beaux arts style, Luna became one of the pioneers of modern design for a school in the Philippines. His work shows that he was at home with both the revivalist and modern styles, using them with impeccable taste and a flair for elegance. A photograph in the <strong><em>Philippine Review</em></strong> of Oct 1920 shows his design in the neobaroque style, which won a prize in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His works in the revivalist style include the Legarda Elementary School, built in 1922; the Alfonso Zobel house on Dewey (now Roxas) Blvd and Padre Faura; the Jacobo Zobel house, now demolished near the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/331\"><strong>Malate Church</strong></a>; the San Vicente de Paul Chapel (now Church) on San Marcelino St, built ca 1930; and the Rafael Fernandez house on Arlegui St, remodeled in 1976 and used by Pres Corazon Aquino as her official residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Works in the art deco and modern styles include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\"><strong>Perez-Samanillo Building</strong></a> on the Escolta; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1429\"><strong>Crystal Arcade</strong></a> on the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a></strong>, destroyed during World War II; the Fernandez-Martinez house on Gen Solano St, San Miguel, Manila; and Saint Cecilia&rsquo;s Hall of St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College, also destroyed during World War II, but restored after the war. The Crystal Arcade, a commercial building housing shops and offices, is regarded as Luna&rsquo;s masterpiece and considered as Manila&rsquo;s most modern building before the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other works of Luna mentioned in prewar publications include the Perkins house on Dewey Blvd; the Basa residence on Lepanto St, Manila; the Evangelista residence on Rizal Ave Extension, and the Sy Cong Bieng Mausoleum, built in the Chinese style at the Manila North Cemetery. The Perkins house, said to be the most beautiful in the country when it was built, won first prize in the 1925 House Beautiful Contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1902, when he was 15, one of his paintings exhibited in the Colonial Exposition in Hanoi, Indochina (now Vietnam) earned an honorable mention. In 1904, one of his entries in the Saint Louis Exposition in the United States won a silver medal. One of his works won a medal at the exhibition of the Society of Artists in Manila in 1908. At the Salon des Artistes Francais he won a prize for his design for a school of fine arts in Manila. In 1949, he became the first recipient of the Gold Medal of Merit awarded by the PIA. In 1964, he was posthumously given the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award by the city of Manila. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

He and painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\"><strong>Arturo Luz</strong></a> are sons of landowners Valeriano Luz and Rosario Dimayuga of Lipa, Batangas. His mother was an interior designer. After finishing high school at Ateneo de Manila in 1940, Luz enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) School of Architecture. World War II interrupted his studies. After the war, he left for the United States and studied at the University of California (UC) Berkeley, where he received an award of distinction for one of his designs. In 1949, he graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He returned to Manila in 1950 and, upon receiving his license, began his practice with  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2698\">Carlos Santos-Viola</a></strong>, with whom he organized the firm Luz-Santos-Viola. After the partnership ended, Luz established his own office. In 1964, he organized AJ Luz Associates, an integrated architectural and engineering firm that offered a wide range of services for domestic and international projects. In 1967, Luz migrated to Canada after selling out to his partners. The firm was renamed Arcenas and Payumo Associates. In Canada, Luz worked briefly in the Ericksen-Massey architectural firm, then for 10 years with Townley Matheson and Partners as a partner. He returned to the Philippines in 1978 and opened a new office, Ameca Total Construction System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major projects of AJ Luz Associates include the regional headquarters for the World Health Organization on Taft Ave, Manila, 1958; Far East Bank and Trust Company head offices in Intramuros, 1959-60; the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, 1961; and the Ramon Magsaysay Building on Roxas Blvd, Manila, 1966. He also designed several buildings known by numbers: 666 T. M. Kalaw, Manila; 1414 Roxas Blvd, Manila; 1515 Roxas Blvd, Manila; and 1010 A. Mabini, Manila&mdash;all built in the 1960s. The firm&rsquo;s industrial projects include buildings for the Republic Cement Corporation in Norzagaray, Bulacan, 1956; Standard Vacuum Refining Corporation in Limay, Bataan, 1959; General Milling Corporation in Mactan, Cebu, 1960; and Dole Philippines in Polomolok, South Cotabato, 1963.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luz&rsquo;s buildings are characterized by studied simplicity, reflecting an approach to design that is concerned with integrity, efficiency, and precision. &ldquo;The architect&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; he once wrote, &ldquo;places him in the triple role of artist, engineer, and social scientist. As an artist, he creates forms that will strike the proper chord in man&rsquo;s heart. As an engineer, he uses the resources of the earth and&hellip; builds for permanence, making every part of his structure serve to its fullest measure. As a social scientist, he probes deeply into man&rsquo;s needs and problems, and provides surroundings that will permit him to develop to the fullest extent&mdash;in comfort, harmony, and beauty. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

He was the son of Juan Mapua and Justina Bautista. He married Rita Moyaand they had three children. After Mapua&rsquo;s early schooling at Ateneo de Manila and Liceo de Manila, he was enrolled at Boones Preparatory School in Berkeley, California, 1903-07. He studied at Cornell University where he obtained a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in architecture in 1911. Mapua was the first registered architect in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He worked as a draftsman at the Bureau of Public Works, 1911-15, then resigned to go into private practice. In 1918, he returned to the bureau and was appointed supervising architect, a post he held until 1927. In this capacity, he supervised the construction of numerous government buildings in Manila and in the provinces. After leaving government service, he established the Mapua-Yuchiangco-Tiaoque Construction Works Inc, which undertook the construction of various major buildings, among them the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Manila Post Office Building</a></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, he founded the Mapua Institute of Technology (MIT), which began as a night school for working students. The institute, which was first housed in a portion of the old La Vanguardia Building on Carriedo St, has since grown into a major engineering and architectural school. The establishment of MIT and the high standard of training it has maintained are his most significant contributions to the development of architecture and the architectural profession in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mapua was the chairperson of the first Board of Examiners for Architects in the Philippines. He was one of the founders&mdash;and later president&mdash;of the Philippine Architects Society, which was later renamed Philippine Institute of Architects.

The son of Sebastian Mendoza and Damasa Marcelo, he was married to Aurora Alisangco. They had seven children. Mendoza graduated from Mapua Institute of Technology in 1938 with a degree in architecture. He taught at Mapua, 1946-65, and lectured for two years at the University of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mendoza is distinguished for his commitment to raising the standards of the architectural profession. During his two terms in 1979 and 1980 as president of the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2705\"><strong>United Architects of the Philippines (UAP)</strong></a></strong>, he worked for the formulation of a new five-year, ladder-type curriculum for the bachelor&rsquo;s course in architecture, which with government approval was immediately implemented. He undertook the preparation of UAP documents on the practice of architecture, particularly the Architect&rsquo;s National Code, consisting of the code of ethical conduct and the standards of professional practice, and the UAP General Conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was president of the Philippine Institute of Architects in 1965, the United Technological Organizations of the Philippines in 1965, and the Philippine Federation of Professional Associations in 1981. He actively participated in the Architects&rsquo; Regional Council Asia, a council of architectural associations from 11 Asian countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His major works include the Batasang Pambansa Buildings in Quezon City; the Development Academy of the Philippines Building in Pasig City; the Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation Building on Buendia, Makati, and 23 of its branches throughout the country; the Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank Building (Antonino Building) on T. M. Kalaw, Manila; the Far Eastern University Hospital on Nicanor Reyes, Manila; the Library and the Science Center buildings of Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro; the San Jose Seminary Building in the Ateneo de Manila University campus in Quezon City; the Assumption School buildings in Antipolo, Rizal; and the Mormon Temple in Green Meadows, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He designed seven new buildings for the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, 1976-91. The municipal building, public market, multipurpose hall, and glorieta in San Fernando, La Union, were among his government projects. He also did projects in Guam and the United States, including the 250-room Suehiro Hotel and the Safeway Supermarket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nature plays an important part in Mendoza&rsquo;s approach to design. He is meticulous about orientation when planning a building and makes the fullest possible use of natural light and ventilation. Through large openings and interior gardens, he brings the outdoors indoors. The use of wide eaves and balconies to protect openings gives his works a distinctly tropical character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1976, Mendoza received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. In 1982, the UAP conferred on him its highest honor, the Likha Award and Gold Medal of Merit. He was the first recipient of the award. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

He was the son of Enriqueta Sancho and Ramon Nakpil, who studied industrial design as a government pensionado in the United States. He first married Carmen Diaz, with whom he had two daughters. After her death, he married the writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5352\"><strong>Carmen Guerrero</strong></a>, then already a widow; they had three children, one of whom, Luis, is an architect. National Artist for architecture  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2681\">JuanF. Nakpil</a></strong> is his cousin. After finishing high school at De La Salle College (now University), he studied architecture at the University of Santo Tomas (UST), graduating in 1936. He did graduate work in Harvard University, where he came under the influence of Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus in Germany and an exponent of the International Style, who was then a professor at Harvard. Nakpil earned a master&rsquo;s degree in regional planning in 1940.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon returning to Manila he was engaged by the US Army Engineer&rsquo;s Office. In 1941, he began working with the Land Planning Commission and was assigned to prepare a new plan for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\"><strong>Baguio City</strong></a>. With the outbreak of World War II, the project was abandoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He served as commissioner of the City Planning Office of Manila, 1947-49. In 1949, he established his own office as architect and city planner. In 1976, he joined Gabriel P. Formoso and Partners as a senior partner. He taught at the UST School of Architecture, 1950-61, and served as its dean, 1959-61. He was a member of the Philippine Institute of Architects and was a charter member of the United Architects of the Philippines, founded in 1975. His major works include the National Press Club (NPC) Building on Magallanes Drive, Manila; the former head office of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT) on Dela Rosa St, Makati; various buildings for PLDT; the Lopez Museum Building on Lancaster St, Pasay; the Picache Building in Quiapo, Manila; the Roche Building on Pasong Tamo, Makati; and the Petrona Apartments on Taft Ave, Manila. His designs are characterized by both discipline and daring. While the cylindrical, glass-sheathed stairway of the NPC Building was daring at the time, it was in fact so designed to keep the vertical traffic of the multi-purpose building away from the normal functions of each floor. In the Petrona Apartments, the massive wall facing the street protects the rooms from glare and street noise, while windows opening to the sides of the property admit the breeze. The Lopez Museum Building is triangular in plan and has cantilevered floors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perceptive, articulate, and highly cultured, Nakpil wrote a number of articles&mdash;among them, &ldquo;Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; &ldquo;Filipino Modern,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Homes for the Middle Income Group.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1974, Nakpil was given the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award by the city of Manila. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

He was the only son of composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4093\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Julio Nakpil</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a> and Gregoria de Jesus, the widow of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a></strong>. He was married to Anita Noble, by whom he had three sons, Ariston and Francisco, both architects, and Eulogio, a civil engineer. After graduating from Manila High School in 1917, Nakpil took up engineering at the University of the Philippines (UP). Then he enrolled at the University of Kansas, where he obtained a civil engineering degree in 1922. While studying in Kansas he supported himself by playing the piano for the Filipino String Orchestra. He also studied in France, where he obtained a diploma in architecture from the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts in 1925. The following year, 1926, he received a master&rsquo;s degree in architecture from Harvard University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nakpil returned to Manila in 1926 and worked as assistant architect in the Bureau of Public Works. In 1928, he became a partner in the firm of architect  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a></strong> and structural engineer Jose G. Cortes, and with them designed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\"><strong>Perez-Samanillo Building</strong></a> on the Escolta. As the designer of Puyat and Sons, 1928-31, he introduced art deco motifs into the furniture industry. In 1930, he won second prize in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><strong>Bonifacio Monument</strong></a> Competition. That same year he opened his own office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He taught at Mapua Institute of Technology, 1927-31, and at the University of Santo Tomas, 1931-38. In addition, he took part in various initiatives to upgrade building standards and improve the condition of architects&mdash;for example, through the Building Code Committee of Manila. Soon after World War II he formed a partnership with his cousin  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2680\"><strong>Angel E. Nakpil</strong></a></strong> and his brother-in-law  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2698\">Carlos Santos-Viola</a></strong>. In 1953, with his sons, he formed a partnership, Juan F. Nakpil and Sons. Both Ariston (b. 1928) and Francisco (b. 1929) had obtained a master&rsquo;s degree in architecture from Cranbrook Academy, while Eulogio (b. 1931) had obtained a master&rsquo;s degree in civil engineering from Yale University. The partnership was dissolved after the death of Ariston in 1981. Nakpil was one of the founders and the first president of the Philippine Architects&rsquo; Society, established in 1933, which later became the Philippine Institute of Architects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the start of his career and together with his sons, he designed more than 200 buildings, including office buildings, movie houses, hospitals, school buildings, churches, and residences. His first building, the Geronimo de los Reyes Building, was in the art deco style, with which he became familiar when he visited the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs in Paris in 1925. Other major works before World War II include the Capitan Pepe Building, the Quezon Institute Administration Building and Pavilions, the Manila Jockey Club, the Avenue Hotel and Theater, Quiapo Church (the nave of which has been altered), and the residence of Gen Vicente Lim on Vito Cruz, Pasay City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The range of his style is represented in the neobaroque Quiapo Church; the art deco Nakpil-Bautista Pylon at the North Cemetery, which combined stylized flora and angular forms; and the Manila Jockey Club, done in the then-emerging International Style, notable for its minimal surface decor and for the facade&rsquo;s interplay between two rounded forms: the entrance hall and the glass-enclosed circular stairwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His major works after the war include the Philippine Trust Building on Plaza Goiti and the Security Bank and Trust Building constructed in 1954. Nakpil undertook the reconstruction of the Rizal house in Calamba, Laguna, which was completed in 1950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the immediate postwar period, the buildings of Juan Nakpil and his sons, as exemplified by the UP Administration and Library Buildings, and Ever and State Theaters on Rizal Ave, at first kept to the rigors of the International Style. However, in the 1960s, an exuberant warmth began to affirm itself. The use of folded plate as a structural shell encouraged the use of diamond-shaped supports on the exterior. Within appeared a rich play of textures: pebble-washed floors, adobe screen walls, wooden stairs and screens with a natural finish. Examples of this new style were the now-demolished Rizal Theater in Makati, the Baldwin Young house in Forbes Park, the Rufino Building on Ayala Ave, and the Commercial Bank and Trust Company Building at the Quezon Blvd rotunda in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nakpil received the Gold Medal of Merit in 1950 from the Philippine Institute of Architects, and was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1954. In 1968, he was given the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award by the city of Manila.

		"text": "<p><strong>NATIONAL HISTORICAL COMMISSION OF THE PHILIPPINES</strong> ( <strong>NHCP</strong> ). Formerly known as the National Historical Institute (NHI), NHCP traces its ancestry to the Philippine Historical Research and Markers Committee (PHRMC), which was established by American governor-general Frank J. Murphy through Executive Order 451 in 1933 to identify, designate, and mark historic sites in the country. The PHRMC introduced the cast iron plaque with black background and white letters, which has remained as the type of historical marker used to the present. The PHRMC was replaced by the Philippine Historical Committee (PHC) during the Commonwealth period, but the subsequent Japanese occupation in 1941 terminated its activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, PHC spearheaded the restoration of the Rizal Shrine in Calamba, Laguna, acquired several Rizaliana memorabilia, and marked more than 400 historic sites. Other historical agencies that coexisted with PHC are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong> <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </strong></a> National Centennial Commission and the National Heroes Commission (NHC). The National Historical Commission was established in 1965 through Republic Act 4368, which abolished the PHC and the NHC, with the newly formed commission assuming their functions. However, the passage of Presidential Decree No. 1 in 1972 saw the reorganization of the National Historical Commission into the National Historical Institute.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the enactment of Republic Act 10086 in 2010, the NHI was renamed National Historical Commission of the Philippines. As a commission, it has upgraded its status and become co-partners of other government historical and cultural bodies like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\"><strong>National Commission for Culture and the Arts</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, the NHCP initiated its five-year NHCP Shrine Development Plan, which aimed to popularize the life and achievements of Filipino national heroes through the structural and curatorial redevelopment of shrine museums using the latest interactive exhibits, holograms, and computer-based technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NHCP has also expanded the marking of sites by declaring  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/418\">Dapitan</a></strong> a Heritage Zone in 2011. It also recognized  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/420\">Iloilo</a></strong> &rsquo;s business district as Heritage Zone in 2014. A  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">Heritage</a></strong> Zone is not just a single building or structure but a group of buildings, open sites like plazas, bridges, and streets of historical and cultural significance and considered part of the national patrimony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NHCP is mandated by Republic Act 10086, &ldquo;Strengthening Peoples&rsquo; Nationalism through Philippine History Act,&rdquo; to be &ldquo;the primary government agency responsible for history and the authority to determine all factual matters relating to official Philippine history.&rdquo; Accordingly, it is tasked to conduct and support all kinds of research relating to Philippine national and local history; develop educational materials in various media; implement historical educational activities for the popularization of Philippine history; disseminate information regarding Philippine historical events, dates, places, and personages; undertake and prescribe the manner of restoration, conservation, and protection of the country&rsquo;s historical movable and immovable objects; manage, maintain, and administer national shrines, monuments, historical sites, edifices, and landmarks of significant historic-cultural value; and actively engage in the settlement or resolution of controversies or issues relative to historical personages, places, dates, and events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To carry out its mandate, the NHCP works through four main divisions: Research, Publications, and Heraldry Division; Historic Preservation Division; Historic Sites and Education Division; and Materials Research and Conservation Division. The Historic Preservation Division maintains the National Registry of Historic Structures in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NHCP has been active in undertaking reconstruction and conservation of historic and cultural sites damaged by the Oct 2013 earthquake and the Nov 2013 typhoon Yolanda, which devastated the Visayas. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Bryan Anthony C.

The artifactsrecovered from the <i>San Diego</i> galleon that sank in 1600 near Fortune Island, Batangas, makes up a major part of the permanent exhibition. The ethnographic collection highlights the different cultural practices of Filipino people groups based on the character of the country&rsquo;s geography and social relationships articulated through diverse economic systems, lifeways, religious worldviews, language, and everyday material culture. These include examples of culturally significant objects from Northern and Southern Philippines in the form of textiles, carvings, metalcraft, and examples of traditional houses. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Clod Krister Marlan V.

He started private practice in 1928 and formed a partnership with  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2636\"><strong>Tomas Arguelles</strong></a></strong>. Ocampo was one of the founders of the UST School of Fine Arts and Architecture, established in 1930, and a member of the Board of Examiners for Architects, 1929-30. In 1933, he co-founded the Philippine Architects Society, later named the Philippine Institute of Architects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although better known at present for having designed the reconstructed Manila Metropolitan Cathedral in 1958, Ocampo was in fact one of the pioneers of modern Filipino architecture, a contemporary of  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a></strong> and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a></strong>. His early works include the Paterno Building at the foot of Santa Cruz (now MacArthur) Bridge, the Oriental Club, and the Cu Un Jieng Building on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\"><strong>Escolta</strong></a>. The Central Seminary Building at the UST campus appears traditionalist in design, but with the horizontal thrust of its balconies and its art deco ornaments, it exemplifies the modern style of the period. The residence designed by Ocampo for Benigno Aquino Sr in San Miguel, Manila, is a fine example of art deco architecture of the 1930s&mdash;with its boxlike forms, flat overhangs, porthole windows, rounded corners, and roof decks that suggest an ocean liner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ocampo&rsquo;s works in the traditionalist mode include the Arguelles Building on Rizal Ave; the Sacred Heart Novitiate Building in Novaliches; the Admiral Apartments on Dewey (now Roxas) Blvd; the restored Cathedral of the Assumption in San Fernando, Pampanga; and the Church of Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary in Angeles City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1964, Ocampo received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p><strong>PARSONS</strong><strong>, WILLIAM</strong> ( <strong><strong>William</strong> Edward Parsons</strong> ) b. Akron, Ohio, USA 19 Jun 1872. d. 1939. Architect. He studied at Yale University where he earned an arts degree in 1895, then at Columbia University for a master&rsquo;s degree in architecture, graduating in 1897. At Yale, one of his classmates was Francis Burton Harrison, who became governor-general of the Philippines. He received the McKim fellowship, which allowed him to enroll at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris, France, 1898-1901. Returning to his home country, he worked in the architectural office of John Galen Howard in New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On his return to the United States from his survey trip in the Philippines,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a></strong> began to search for an architect who would supervise the implementation of his plans for Manila and Baguio. Impressed with Parsons&rsquo;s credentials, Burnham chose him to be the Philippine government&rsquo;s consulting architect. Arriving in Manila on 17 Nov 1905, Parsons organized the American and Filipino staff of the architectural office of the Bureau of Public Works. Under his contract with the government, Parsons would be paid 6,000 US dollars a year. To augment this income, he was allowed to engage in private practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parsons&rsquo;s work included implementing Burnham&rsquo;s plans for Manila and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\"><strong>Baguio</strong></a>, preparing city plans for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\"><strong>Cebu</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/430\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>, planning provincial government centers, and designing as well as supervising the design of buildings for Manila and various parts of the country. His authority was vast, allowing him to supervise designs of all buildings and parks from the national to the municipal level. Deploring the policies of President Wilson and Gov-Gen Harrison, which aimed to prepare the Philippines for early independence, Parsons resigned from his position in 1914. On returning to the United States, he joined the Chicago Office of Edward H. Bennet, a former associate of Burnham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parsons&rsquo;s first building was the psychiatric ward at San Lazaro Hospital, 1907; the British Manila Club, 1908; Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association (YMCA) Building and Brent Episcopal Church in Baguio, and the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army-Navy Club</a></strong>, all in 1909. His major buildings include the Philippine General Hospital, 1910; Elks Club, 1911; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\"><strong>Manila Hotel</strong></a>, 1912; and the Normal School and its women&rsquo;s dormitory, both in 1914. He also designed the provincial government buildings of Albay and Pampanga, both in 1907; Laguna and Capiz, both in 1908; and Tarlac, 1909. Throughout the Philippines, he also designed schoolhouses and markets like Paco, 1912.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toward the end of his assignment in the Philippines, Parsons designed the first buildings of the University of the Philippines (UP), 1913&mdash;in particular, the University Hall on Taft Ave and Padre Faura St. One of his enduring legacies is his work on other schools. He designed Tondo Intermediate School, 1909, which was replicated for the Cebu High School, 1914. He was also responsible for planning the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\">Gabaldon Schools</a></strong>, whose prototypic plans were published by the Bureau of Education in 1912, <strong><em>Bulletin No. 37 School Buildings and Grounds</em></strong>. His other works, although lesser known, were the Manila City Aquarium, 1912, and the Bilibid Prison Hospital and Gateway, Muntinlupa, 1907. The Cebu Aduana or Custom House, 1911, and the Tarlac Provincial Prison, 1913, are attributed to him. Other works were the Tondo Fire Station, 1912; the Cottage of the Singalong Experimental Station, 1906; the Gatehouse of the Reservoir of the New Waterworks System, 1907; the Sewer Pumping Stations of Manila, 1908; the UP College of Surgery and Medicine, 1910; the Communicable Disease Ward at San Lazaro Hospital, 1913; the Philippine School of Arts and Trade, 1914; and his own house facing Manila Bay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parsons&rsquo;s early works in the Philippines can be characterized as modern, being simplified versions of 19th-century Spanish-Filipino architecture. One factor that contributed to his early style was the use of reinforced concrete, which, with its plain, clean surfaces, and clean edges, made buildings look lighter. In his later works, mainly for UP, Parsons turned to the neoclassic, thereby establishing the style for future government buildings. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

From 1956 to 1963, he worked at the Board of Travel and Tourist Industry as a staff writer, then as director of research and publications, technical assistant to the commissioner of tourism, and deputy commissioner for research and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1963, he entered the Abbey of Our Lady of Montserrat in Manila as postulant. He pronounced his simple vows as a Benedictine in 1965 and his solemn profession in 1968. He was ordained priest in 1969, after completing his philosophical studies at San Beda College in 1966 and theological studies at the Loyola House of Studies School of Theology in Ateneo de Manila University. Only two years after ordination, Perez was appointed rector of San Beda College in 1971. He held the position until 1974, then again in 1977-83 when he was appointed prior delegate of the Abbey. He served his third and longest term as rector from 1986 to 2001. This term coincided with San Beda&rsquo;s centennial celebrated in school year 2000-2001. At the end of the centennial, Perez retired as rector of San Beda College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perez began writing articles on the arts and architecture in 1951. His articles appeared in <strong><em>Sunday Times Magazine</em></strong>, <strong><em>Progress</em></strong> ( <strong><em>Manila Times Yearbook</em></strong> ), <strong><em>Comment</em></strong>, <strong><em>Japan Architect</em></strong>, <strong><em>American Journal of Architects</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Mobilways</em></strong>.

		"text": "<p><strong>SANTOS-VIOLA</strong><strong>, CARLOS</strong> ( <strong>Carlos Antonio Santos-Viola</strong> ) b. San Miguel, Bulacan 9 Apr 1912. d. Quezon City, 31 Jul 1994. Architect.One of the six children of Melecio de Guzman Santos and Miguela Magpitang Antonio, his siblings included Miguela, Cezar, Adriana, Cleotilde, and Jorge. He married Caridad Nakpil, Architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2681\"><strong>Juan Nakpil</strong></a>&rsquo;s youngest sister. He and Caridad had five children: Rosario, Milagros, Paz, Lourdes, and Carlos Jr. He grew up in a<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a>(stone house) in San Miguel, whose basic form he later reinterpreted in the private residences that he designed. From San Miguel Elementary School, he moved to Ateneo de Manila to finish his high school in 1930. In Ateneo, he joined the school band and was active in playing basketball. He also played the saxophone and enjoyed lawn tennis throughout his life. He was one of the first graduates of the College of Architecture of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1935. His professors were outstanding architects and engineers such as  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2636\"><strong>Tomas Arguelles</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\"><strong>Tomas Mapua</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a></strong>,and Juan Nakpil. He placed 10th in the board examinations for architects in 1938. He worked as an assistant architect for Wurdemann &amp; Beckett, building the Jai Alai court and gallery on Taft Ave, Manila, and in the office of Juan Nakpil as a draftsman. He became an associate architect in Juan Nakpil&rsquo;s office in 1946 until 1950, when he set up his own office.  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2672\"><strong>Alfredo Luz</strong></a></strong> was his partner for some time. From 1949 to 1981, he taught at the UST College of Architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santos-Viola is known as the chief architect of Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) structures, but he has also designed Catholic churches, schools, private homes, and industrial buildings. The INC churches, characterized by their many vertical spires, are imaginative yet functional buildings, full of surface decoration yet generally unified in conception. The Temple Central, 1982, consists of three halls that can combine into one huge space. Its exterior exudes grandeur. In contrast to the INC churches, Santos-Viola&rsquo;s Catholic churches are markedly horizontal. Among these are the Our Lady of Lourdes in Quezon City; the Franciscan churches of Singalong, Mandaluyong-Pasig, Tagaytay, and Lipa City; and the most visually satisfying, Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia in Ermita, Manila. Some of his more important residential designs were for Hilario Zialcita, Ford Wilkins, Pablo Sarangaya, Manuel Locsin, Bienvenido Tantoco, and Jorge Vargas. Santos-Viola finished his studies when the International Style was beginning to penetrate the Philippines. Although he embraced its major tenets, he continued to employ surface ornamentation. In this he adheres to a common Filipino pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1981, Santos-Viola received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. He was a member of the Philippines Institute of Architects (PIA) since 1938 and its chancellor in 1989-90. In 1990, he received the Gold Medal of Merit from the PIA. In 2013, an exhibit of his works, titled <strong><em>Sacred Spires: Iglesia ni Cristo Architecture of Carlos Santos-Viola</em></strong>, was held as part of the Philippine Arts Festival. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5798\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Fernando N.

		"text": "<p><strong>SANTOS</strong><strong>, ILDEFONSO P.</strong> ( <strong>Ildefonso Paez Santos Jr</strong> ) aka IP Santos, Sir IP. b. Malabon, Rizal 5 Sep 1929. d. 29 Jan 2014. Landscape architect. National Artist for Architecture. His parents were Ildefonso Santos and Asuncion Paez. His father, Ildefonso Sr, was an educator and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\"><strong>Tagalog</strong></a> poet, who wrote under the pen name Ilaw Silangan (Eastern Light). He was married to Amparo Eugenio, with whom he had four daughters. He got two bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in architecture, one from the University of Santo Tomas, 1954, and another from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles (USCLA), 1956, and a master&rsquo;s degree also from USCLA, 1960. He worked with Cornell, Bridgers, and Trollers, landscape architects, in Los Angeles, 1955-63. Upon returning to Manila in 1963, he established his own firm, undertaking projects in the Philippines, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Guam, Thailand, Singapore, Taipei, and Bahrain. Since 1964 he lectured at the University of the Philippines (UP). He was designated as landscape architectural consultant for the UP campus in 1965. In 1971, he introduced in UP the first Philippine undergraduate program in tropical  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscape architecture</a></strong>. He was appointed as head of the university&rsquo;s graduate program in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was president of the Philippine Association of Landscape Architects, 1977-85, and was elected fellow in 1985. He was a member of the Board of Examiners for Landscape Architecture of the Professional Regulation Commission, 1982-1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santos transformed the image of the landscape architect as a glorified gardener to an architectural profession that requires the knowledge of architecture, engineering, and aesthetics and the ability to plan irrigation, drainage, lighting, and a comprehensive topographical analysis in landscaping. Santos&rsquo;s landscapes take advantage of the rich bounty of tropical foliage and plants. His projects take into account the need for shade, close-seating, conversation, and social interaction, and is sensitive to the psychological, behavioral, and social needs of the Filipinos. This gives his works a distinctive Filipino feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His projects include landscaping for hotels, commercial and shopping centers, banks, resorts, sports complexes, memorial parks, parks and playgrounds, office buildings, condominiums, subdivisions, and housing projects. His first major project was with the Makati Commercial Center where he introduced landscape walks, fountains, and sculptures as part of a strip mall. Among his larger projects were the Batulao Village Club in Batangas, the Caliraya Lake Resort in Laguna, the Eternal Gardens Memorial Park in Caloocan City, the Loyola Memorial Park in Manila and Para&ntilde;aque, the Imus town plaza in Cavite, and the Raintree Sports Club in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At Rizal Park in Manila, Santos did the Artists&rsquo; Village, the Garden for the Blind, the Teodoro F. Valencia Circle, the rehabilitation of the Japanese Garden, and the setting up of the Execution of Dr  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong> </strong> site. He also did the landscaping for the  <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong>, San Miguel Corporation Building, the defunct Nayong Filipino, Paco Park, Asian Institute of Management, all in Metro Manila; the Tagaytay Highlands Golf and Country Club, Tagaytay, Cavite; Mount Malarayat Golf and Country Club Lipa, Batangas, and Orchard Golf and Country Club, Imus, Cavite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santos wrote papers on landscape architecture in the Philippines and in the context of a developing country. He also accumulated an impressive library on landscape architecture with about 1,200 books, published from 1960 to 2010. His collection was formally turned over to the UP College of Architecture Library in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972, the city of Manila conferred on Santos the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award. In 1979, Malaca&ntilde;an gave him a plaque of appreciation for his work in Nayong Filipino. In 1986, he was named Outstanding Landscape Architect by the United Garden Clubs of the Philippines and the Garden Clubs of the Philippines in 1988. In 2006, he was conferred the title National Artist for architecture. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p><strong>SEDE&Ntilde;O, ANTONIO</strong> b. San Clemente, diocese of Cuenca, 1535. d. Cebu 1 Sep 1595. Jesuit priest, architect, builder. Antonio Sede&ntilde;o was 46 years old when he arrived in Manila on 17 Sep 1581. Before he joined the Jesuits on 25 Apr 1559, he worked for the duke of Feria, where he learned the principles and techniques of construction. Prior to the Philippines, Sede&ntilde;o had been rector of the German College in Rome and a veteran of the Florida mission. When the third general San Francisco de Borja closed Florida, Sede&ntilde;o was sent to Mexico, where he founded a college. Intending to volunteer for Japan, he could not get passage as no ship was sailing. While waiting for the next ship, he received the order from Borja&rsquo;s successor, Everard Mercurian, to head a mission to the Philippines. He left for the Philippines with Fr Alonso Sanchez, Bro Nicolas Gallardo, and Gaspar Suarez de Toledo. Suarez died on board the ship. Sede&ntilde;o&rsquo;s original directive was not to establish a permanent mission but to reconnoiter and report to Rome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the trip across the Pacific, he befriended Domingo de Salazar, OP, who was sent to Manila to be its first bishop. This friendship would benefit the development of colonial architecture. In Aug 1583, after a fire consumed Manila, then a humble collection of thatch, bamboo, and timber houses, Salazar asked Sede&ntilde;o to rebuild the bishop&rsquo;s residence using more permanent material. On an earlier exploratory trip up the Pasig River, the bishop came upon the<em>adobe</em>outcrops of Guadalupe. Quarrying the stones in Guadalupe, slaking lime from oyster shells, and hewing tropical hardwood, a team of workers, drawn from the Chinese artisans and workers in Manila, was directed by Sede&ntilde;o. After completing the bishop&rsquo;s residence, Gov-Gen Santiago de Vera asked Sede&ntilde;o to build a fortification for Manila. He built Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia in 1587, a tower designed, said its critics, in the medieval style. In 1595, when Gov-Gen Luis Perez de Dasmari&ntilde;as began replacing the palisade around Manila with stonewalls, the tower was integrated into the city&rsquo;s defenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1590, Sede&ntilde;o began his most ambitious project, a church for the Jesuits in Intramuros. Named after Santa Ana, the mother of the Virgin Mary, the church was almost complete in 1595. That same year, Sede&ntilde;o was appointed vice-provincial of the Jesuits in the Philippines and a royal decree designated islands and provinces to the different orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sede&ntilde;o did not complete the year. Traveling by boat to Cebu, where he had asked Pedro Chirino to establish a central house for the Visayas, he was caught in a storm and arrived in Cebu quite ill. He died in the house Chirino had prepared, a gift of Lt Henao, a benefactor of the Jesuits.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

In 1946, he graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in architecture from the University of Santo Tomas (UST). He was a member of the faculty of the UST School of Architecture, 1952-59. He was senior managing partner of Sindiong, Ocampo and Garcia, Architects and Engineers, 1973-84. In 1985, he established the firm Antonio S. Sindiong and Associates. Sindiong was president of the Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA), 1960-62, and was named fellow in 1984. He served as chairperson of the Board of Examiners for Architects of the Professional Regulation Commission, 1966-71. He is an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the abrogation of the 30-meter limit on the height of buildings, Sindiong became a pioneer in designing high-rise buildings in the country. His major works include the 43-story Pacific Plaza Condominium, the 28-story Ritz Towers, the 22-story Metrobank Plaza, and the 20-story La Metropole Condominium, all in Makati. The 20-story Cebu Plaza Hotel, designed by him, is the tallest in Cebu City. The six-story SM Megamall on Epifanio de los Santos Ave in Mandaluyong City, is more than half a kilometer in length and has a total floor area of 330,000 sq m. Sindiong&rsquo;s previous shopping mall projects include the Harrison Plaza Shopping Center, Manila; the Ali Mall II and the New Farmers Plaza Shopping Center, both in Cubao, Quezon City. Projects overseas include the East Pakistan Rice Research Institute in Bangladesh; the Kebayoran Housing Project in Indonesia; and the Arabian Villas in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sindiong&rsquo;s more notable works are marked by an urbane elegance resulting from design that is both imaginative and disciplined. The contrast of colors and textures&mdash;dark-tinted glass against white concrete&mdash;and the angular movement of planes give the Ritz Towers an air of playful sophistication. The tightly drawn fabric of rose-colored glass on the Pacific Plaza Building sets it apart from Makati&rsquo;s concrete-clad structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1989, the PIA awarded Sindiong the Gold Medal of Merit. In the same year he received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

The son of Jose Toledo and Cayetana Ma&ntilde;alac, he grew up in Cavite. He was married to Pura Emile, and after her death, to Josefina Soler. While studying at Cavite High School, Toledo passed the government examination for pensionados. He was sent to the United States where he completed his secondary schooling. He studied at the Brooklyn Institute of Technology, 1905-6, then took a course in architecture at the Ohio State University, 1906-10, but spent a year, 1908-9, at Cornell University. In Columbus, Ohio, he worked for the firm Howell and Thomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning to the Philippines in 1911, he was employed at the Bureau of Public Works under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2690\"><strong>William Parsons</strong></a>. He rose through the ranks and in 1928 became consulting architect, the position he held until his retirement from government service in 1954.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1947, Toledo was a member of the architects and engineers mission that toured the United States and South America to prepare for the planning of the Capitol buildings and the University of the Philippines (UP) campus in Diliman, Quezon City.

He was named fellow of the Philippine Institute of Architect (PIA) in 1952.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Parsons, Toledo designed the women&rsquo;s dormitory of the Philippine Normal School. After Parsons left the bureau in 1914, Toledo took charge of designing the buildings for the UP Padre Faura campus, among them the College of Medicine Annex and the University Library. His other major works include the Leyte Capitol, built in the 1920s; the buildings of the Department of Agriculture and Commerce (later Tourism) and the Department of Finance, built in 1940; and the City Hall of Manila, built in 1941. Other provincial government buildings in many parts of the country were also designed by him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toledo faithfully adhered to the neoclassic style, of which he was a master. The twin buildings on what is popularly called the Agrifina Circle (after the Agriculture and Finance Buildings) count among the noblest edifices of Manila, with their impressive proportions and refined details. The buildings have been turned over to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2684\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>National Museum of the Philippines</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>.

		"text": "<p><strong>UNITED ARCHITECTS OF THE PHILIPPINES</strong> ( <strong>UAP</strong> ) The UAP was established in 1974 and since then has been the only professional organization of architects in the country. Like all other  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/257\">architectural organizations</a></strong>, it was established by architects in order to foster unity and cooperation among themselves, thresh out common problems in the profession, uplift the standards of architectural education, and work for the development and upgrading of the profession and the welfare of its practitioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Spanish era, there were no schools of architecture in the Philippines. Filipinos had to learn the skill of erecting architectural structures from a master builder who preceded him in the craft. In the last decade of the 19th century, the Spanish government opened the first formal school for master builders, the Escuela Practica de Artes y Oficios de Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under a civil government established by the Americans in 1901, highways, bridges, schools, hospitals, and government buildings transformed the Philippine landscape. In 1902, many graduates of the Escuela bonded with the civil engineers and surveyors in the country to found the first professional organization of architects and allied professions, the Academia de Arquitectura y Agrimensura de Filipinas. A year after, the academy changed its name to Academia de Ingenieria, Arquitectura, y Agrimensura de Filipinas (AIAAF).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1911, the engineers withdrew to form their own professional organization, but not before the AIAAF had struggled for the passage of an engineers&rsquo;s and architects&rsquo;s law. Act No. 2985, the first enabling law for the practice of the separate professions of engineering and architecture, was enacted later, in 1921. The first batch of Filipino architects was registered on the basis of this act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In view of the growing number of architects, the Philippine Architects Society was organized on the initiative of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2681\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Juan F. Nakpil</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>. The first officers of the society were Juan F. Nakpil, president;  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\"><strong>Tomas Mapua</strong></a></strong>, vice president; Harold H. Keys, secretary-treasurer; and Sidney D. Rowlands and  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2686\"><strong>Fernando H. Ocampo</strong></a></strong>, directors. Among its early accomplishments were the draft of its constitution and by-laws, the rules of charges and professional fees, and the code of ethics of the society. One of the aims of the society was to seek the passage of a law by the National Assembly that would protect the architectural profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1938, the society was renamed Philippine Institute of Architects and Planners and, subsequently, Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA). In 1946, the PIA held its first annual convention. In 1950, about 15 members left the institute and formed the League of Philippine Architects (LPA). It was led by some eminent architects at the time: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\"><strong>Pablo S. Antonio</strong></a>, Antonio V. Ba&ntilde;as, Pablo D. Panlilio, Jose L. Reynoso, and Elias L. Ruiz. They elected the much younger Jose V. Herrera as the league&rsquo;s first president. The schism gave rise to two architects&rsquo;s organizations vying for the membership of the 350 registered architects at the time. (By 1962 LPA membership had grown to 600 when there were about 2,200 registered architects.) In 1955, the Boards of the Institute and the League met to discuss the merger of the organizations, but with no result. In 1957, the PIA was admitted as an affiliate organization of the Union Internationale des Architectes (UIA). The PIA College of Fellows was created in 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architects in the government service formed their own association in 1958 and named it Association of Philippine Government Architects (APGA). In 1965, the PIA, LPA, and APGA passed resolutions approving the Architect&rsquo;s National Code and the Architects&rsquo; Services and Schedule of Fees, which had been prepared by the PIA. Negotiations for the merger of the three organizations continued, but still fruitless. An attempt to have an umbrella organization to unify the three organizations was made by LPA and APGA by organizing the Council of Filipino Architects (CFA), but it was not recognized by PIA. However, it authored what resulted in Presidential Proclamation 934 Series of 1971, designating the second week of December as Nationwide Architecture Week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presidential Decree 223, was issued by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1973. Under this decree, the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) was authorized to regulate all professions and to accredit only one organization for each profession. Pursuant to this, the three architectural organizations voluntarily integrated into the United Architects of the Philippines (UAP). In 1974, the Boards of PIA, LPA, and APGA approved the constitution and by-laws of the UAP. PRC certified the accreditation of UAP as the only accredited professional organization for architects in the Philippines, with PRC Certificate of Accreditation No. 001 on 12 May 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAP aims to promote the highest standards of ethical conduct and excellence in the practice and service of the profession as well as upliftment of the standards of architectural education. The UAP is also committed to unify all registered architects of the Philippines through cooperation and coordination with allied professions, trade and industry, both local and international; participation in national development programs; and cooperation with the Board of Architecture and other government agencies. It is willing to render any lawful and appropriate assistance to any of its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the meeting of the Union Internationale des Architectes (UIA) in Hawaii in Jun 1982, the UIA Bureau concluded that according to laws of the Philippines, the UAP is the only organization with the right to represent the Filipino architects in the Philippines and internationally, particularly in the UIA. In the UIA Council at Santiago, Chile, in Apr 1983, a certification to this effect was issued to UAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAP is one of the founding member-institutes of the Architects Regional Council Asia. Established in 1979, it is composed of the architects&rsquo;s organizations of Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines. It was later joined by Country Institutes of Macau, China, Korea, Lao, Japan, Nepal, Mongolia, and Vietnam. In 1986, the Asian Congress Student Jamboree was launched, giving the would-be architects representing member-countries a chance to experience the benefits of an international conference. The UAP is also a lifetime member of the Eastern Regional Organization for Planning and Human Settlements (EAROPH).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, from the savings of its previous national presidents and contributions of members, the UAP was able to purchase a lot and initiate the construction of its own seven-story headquarters and offices in Quezon City, completed as of May 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAP is a four-time recipient of the PRC citation as &ldquo;Most Outstanding Accredited Professional Organization of the Year&rdquo; (2002, 2007, 2008, and 2011). It also received the EAROPH Golden Jubilee Award in recognition of its substantial contribution to the advancement of planning, development, and management of human settlements in the Philippines. It is the first accredited professional organization to receive the Father Neri Satur Award for Environmental Heroism, 2009. It was commended by the National Economic and Development Authority&ndash;Philippine National Service Coordinating Agency as one of the &ldquo;Outstanding Volunteers&rdquo; in Region IV and by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority as a valuable partner in its Urban Renewal Program. The Metrobank Foundation also honored the UAP as a Partner in Empowerment, Advocacy, and Commitment to Excellence or PEACE. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p><strong>ZARAGOZA, JOSE MA.</strong> ( <strong>Jose Maria Velez Zaragoza</strong> ) b. Manila 6 Dec 1912. d. 1994. National Artist for Architecture. He was the son of Elias Zaragoza, an electrical and mechanical engineer, and Rosario Velez. His grandfather Jose Zaragoza was the owner and editor of <strong><em>La Ilustracion Filipina</em></strong> <em>.</em>Two granduncles were distinguished artists, the painter  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\"><strong>Miguel Zaragoza</strong></a></strong> and the architect  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\"><strong>Felix Roxas</strong></a></strong>. His wife, Pilar Rosello, is an interior designer; their son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2709\"><strong>Ramon</strong></a> is an architect. Zaragoza finished high school at San Beda, and then studied architecture at the University of Santo Tomas where he obtained his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1936, with highest honors. He holds a diploma in liturgical art and architecture from the International Institute of Liturgical Art in Rome, and a diploma in comprehensive planning from the Hilversum Technical Research Center in the Netherlands. Zaragoza was an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He was also a fellow of the Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1938, Zaragoza has designed 36 office buildings; 5 public buildings; 15 airport terminal offices; 4 hotels; 2 hospitals; 45 churches, chapels, and religious centers; 5 low-cost and middle-income housing projects; 15 middle-income condominiums; and over 270 residences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His major projects include the Meralco Building in Pasig; Our Lady of the Holy Rosary in Tala, Novaliches; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a> and Convent in Quezon City; Villa San Miguel, Mandaluyong; Pius XII Catholic Center, Manila; Saint John Bosco Parish Church in Pasay Road, Makati; Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Shrine in Sucat, Para&ntilde;aque; the Philippine Airlines Building on Ayala Ave, Makati; the Philippine Banking Corporation Building at Port Area, Manila; the Union Church in Makati, built 1975, now demolished; Virra Mall, Greenhills, built 1975, demolished 2005; and the Bataan Power Plant of the National Power Corporation. As a member of Hexagon Associated Architects, he was one of those who designed the National Library on T. M. Kalaw, Manila. Low-cost housing projects designed by him include the Saint Joseph the Worker housing project in Pasig and the Tala Leprosarium Housing in Novaliches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Meralco Building, a 15-story office building, is slightly curved to give it more stability and to avoid the boxlike appearance of rectangular buildings and &ldquo;train effect&rdquo; of straight corridors. Tapering vertical sunbreakers enhance the gentle curve of the concave facade. The 1,000-seat Meralco Theater was designed for musical and theatrical presentations, as well as for international conferences. The most famous building by Zaragoza is the present Santo Domingo Church and Convent, which follows the plan of the church-tower- <strong>convento</strong> (parish house) complex of the colonial period. While the building embodies the simplicity of modern design, such features as arches give it a traditional touch. One of the largest in the country, the church is the national shrine of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Santisimo Rosario, also called La Naval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1960, Zaragoza was invited to be guest architect to participate in designing Brasilia, Brazil&rsquo;s new capital, by eminent Brazilian architects Oscar Niemeyer and Lucio Costa.

		"text": "<p><strong>ZARAGOZA</strong><strong>, RAMON MA.</strong> ( <strong>Ramon Ma. Rosello Zaragoza</strong> ) b. 12 Aug 1945. Restoration architect, town planner, essayist. His parents are National Artist for architecture  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2708\"><strong>Jose Ma. Zaragoza</strong></a></strong> and Pilar Rosello.Ramon Ma. Zaragoza comes from a family of architects and engineers. The Zaragoza&rsquo;s Philippine lineage traces to Rafael Zaragoza who worked in Nueva Ecija in the tobacco industry of the 19th century. He had two children, Jose and Miguel. Jose married Rosa Roxas of Quiapo, whose son Elias is Ramon&rsquo;s grandfather. Elias was an engineer who graduated from Yale University in 1906. Elias married Rosario Velez y Infante, thus associating the family with Guagua, Pampanga. He studied at the University of Santo Tomas (UST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ramon studied at De La Salle, completing his elementary years in 1959 and his secondary years in 1963. He obtained a bachelor of science in architecture from UST in 1967. He went to Spain and studied at the Escuela Tecnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid, where he took a postgraduate course in town planning and urban renewal from 1967 to 1968. During this same period, he also studied at the Instituto de Cultura Hispanica, Madrid, where he studied Spanish art. On 5 Jan 1970, he passed the board examination for architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ramon worked closely with his father but came to be known for his restoration works and advocacy expressed through a number of books that he wrote. As an advocate of heritage conservation, he succeeded his father in working on the restoration of Intramuros. From 1980 to 1990, he worked on the walls of Intramuros, its <strong>baluarte</strong> or bastions, fausse-braye, moats, and drawbridges. He also worked on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a>&rsquo;s gate, bridge, and moat and the Plaza de Armas. He also worked on the landscaping and monumental lighting of this historic city. He has also been actively involved in the restoration of heritage structures, like the Shrine of Baldomero Aguinaldo at Binakayan, Cavite; Ermita de San Nicolas de Tolentino, West Rembo, Makati; San Agustin Church, Intramuros; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/376\"><strong>Santa Ana Church</strong></a>, Santa Ana, Pampanga. In 1993, he authored a master plan for Vigan, which recommended that families bear responsibility for the maintenance and restoration of their heritage houses, rather than depend on foreign funding. He recommended that the historic district of Vigan, along Crisologo St be closed off to traffic, warehouses transferred elsewhere, and old residences be reused for tourism as inns, restaurants, and stores. He moved for the dredging of the Mestizo and Govantes Rivers, the removal of illegal fishpens, and the reopening of the Vigan port and the Vigan airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His advocacy for heritage conservation took on a personal turn when he restored a house in Vigan, originally owned by the Encarnacion family. He purchased the house in 1998. In the restoration, some items from the Zaragoza house in Quiapo, like capiz windows, knocker and iron items were incorporated in the restored Vigan house. The house is L-shaped in plan and dated to the 1790s. The house has an inner patio, a unique feature among the Vigan houses. The house was blessed and dedicated to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Paz y Buenviaje, hence the name Villa Paz, and the patio dedicated to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar in honor of Ramon&rsquo;s mother (Zaragoza 2004, 220-75). The house is also known as Museo Zaragoza. In 2005, he restored the altar of the Shrine of the Miraculous Medal in Sucat, Para&ntilde;aque, which his father Jose had designed in 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is the author of <strong><em>Old Manila</em></strong>, 1990, which had a Japanese edition; <strong><em>Lost Era</em></strong>, 1994; <strong><em>La Ilustracion Filipina: 1891-1894</em></strong>, 1992; <strong><em>The Philippines Images of the Past</em></strong>, 1993; and <strong><em>Zaragoza: The Art of Restoration</em></strong>, 2005. Ateneo de Manila University&rsquo;s <strong><em>Budhi: A Journal of Ideas and Culture</em></strong> published his works <strong><em>Ciudad Fernandina, Ilocos Sur</em></strong>, 2004, and <strong><em>Guagua to Quiapo</em></strong>, 2006 as monographs. He also published <strong><em>Philippine Historical Illustrations</em></strong>, <strong><em>Filipino Expressions</em></strong>, <strong><em>Tribal Splendor</em></strong>, <strong><em>Vigan: The Lost Jewel</em></strong>, <strong><em>Villa Paz-Real Zaragoza-Vigan, Ilocos Sur</em></strong>, <strong><em>70th Year of the Philippine Institute of Architects</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Fiesta sa Quiapo</em></strong> (Fiesta at Quiapo)<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He received the Araw ng Maynila Award in 1997 in the field of arts and culture, the De la Salle University Alumni award for architectural excellence in 2002, the 70 Distinguished Men of Service award of the Philippine Institute of Architects in 2008 (PIA), and the PIA Gold Medal of Merit for restoration, conservation, and town planning in 2008.
