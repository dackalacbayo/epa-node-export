		"text": "<p>Published 1987. Author, Pedro G. Galende, OSA. Manila: G. A. Formoso Publishing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Angels</em></strong> <em><strong>in</strong> </em><strong><em>Stone</em></strong> brings together the histories of 162 churches and <strong>conventos</strong> built by the Augustinians, distributed as follows: Metro Manila, 12; Laguna, 1; Batangas, 11; Bulacan, 16; Pampanga, 21; Tarlac, 3; Nueva Ecija, 5; La Union, 10; Ilocos Sur, 15; Abra, 3; Ilocos Norte, 12; Iloilo, 25; Capiz, 6; Antique, 3; Cagayan Islands, 1; and Cebu, 18. The Augustinian churches include such splendid monuments as San Agustin in Manila; Paoay, Laoag, and Sarrat in Ilocos Norte; Santa Maria in Ilocos Sur; Luna in La Union; Taal in Batangas; Miag-ao in Iloilo; Pan-ay in Capiz; and the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, Argao, and Carcar in Cebu. Not all of the 162 churches are well preserved. A number have been altered, partly or extensively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the introduction, the author writes that to avoid major architectural disasters, the chapter of 1644 ordered the Provincial of the order to designate in each region three religious whose advice would be asked in raising any church. Regular chapters were to issue norms ordering the parish priest not to dismantle or wreck churches already started by preceding priests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report on each church includes a description of its location, the history of its foundation and construction, and a description of its architectural style. The longest report is that on San Agustin. Each article is illustrated with photographs taken by the author himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Galende, a Spanish Augustinian priest, refers to the &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; style of church architecture in the Philippines, which he describes as characterized by the use of local motifs and the permeation of Spanish, Muslim, Chinese, and Latin American influences. The baroque style, he observes, is ascendant because it easily absorbs varied attendant elements and personal interpretations, and integrates better into the environment and climate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Information from the vast Augustinian archives makes this book a significant contribution to the literature on church architecture in the Philippines. The book was reissued in 1996.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p>Published 1986, 2010. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2665\">Winand Klassen</a>. Cebu City: University of San Carlos Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the introduction Klassen situates the study in the context of what he theorizes Philippine architecture might be: &ldquo;This study aims to contribute to the development of genuine Filipino architecture which sincerely and truthfully shows the dreams and principles of individual Filipinos and of the country.&rdquo; Klassen adds that in the attempt to arrive at an architecture which is genuinely Filipino, the architect should endeavor to create a good piece of architecture, keeping in mind the physical and cultural conditions of the Philippines. If there is&nbsp;<em>Philippine-ness&nbsp;</em>in his work, it is arrived at incidentally and often unconsciously, depending on the designer&rsquo;s cultural background and inventiveness. Moreover, Klassen believes that a sense of national identity is to be developed not in isolation but in interaction with history and the cultures of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it does not intend to be a history of Philippine architecture, the book describes the structures found or built in the Philippines in diachronic fashion, from the precolonial to the contemporary periods. The book is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1, &ldquo;How it All Began: Primitive Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; discusses in passing the earliest habitation site in the country&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/386\">Tabon Cave Complex</a> in Quezon, Palawan. Klassen also discusses the rice terraces of northern Luzon and its hydraulic technology, and how it inspired architects such as Leandro Locsin, who designed the then new Manila International Airport building as an inverted terrace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2, &ldquo;The Bahay Kubo: Vernacular Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; deals with traditional architecture, which adjusts an existing model depending on a specific need. He describes the many variations of traditional houses in northern Philippines and the beliefs associated with them, and then the different examples of Visayan and Muslim vernacular architecture, and ends with a discussion of vernacular architecture as art and as expressions of the Filipino soul in the field of architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3, &ldquo;Three Hundred Years Under Spain: Spanish Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; first examines the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century and the temporary buildings they built in Cebu such as a chapel and friary. It then moves to the settlements in Manila, describing the process of <strong>reduccion</strong> (controlled settlement) and the early churches of Manila and its environs, like the oldest stone church in the country, the San Agustin church, and those of the Augustinians, Franciscans, Jesuits, Dominicans, and the Augustinian Recollects in different parts of the country. He also discusses Spanish colonial architecture in Cebu City and the preservation of these heritage buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole of Chapter 4, &ldquo;Six Hundred Years of Islam: Muslim Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; is devoted to structures built by groups which have been Islamized, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a>. It discusses the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\"><strong>kota</strong></a> or fortifications as well as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/234\"><strong>masjid</strong></a> or mosques, the <strong>madrasah</strong> or schools, and the traditional <strong>torogan</strong> or large house of the datu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5, &ldquo;Fifty Years with Uncle Sam: The American Period,&rdquo; talks about planner and architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel Burnham</a>, who is famous for designing the cityscape of Manila and Baguio. It also delves into the lives and works of equally prominent architects then, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 6, &ldquo;A Nation At Last: Contemporary Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; deals with the early postwar architects and their works such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, and those architects that became prominent after World War II such as Antonio, Nakpil, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>. It also describes the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Leandro V. Locsin</a> and looks into contemporary architects who made a mark in the architectural scene like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2660\">Gabriel Formoso</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2672\">Alfredo Luz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2708\">Jose Ma. Zaragoza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2647\">William V. Coscolluela</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2695\">Jorge Ramos</a>. Architectural associations are also mentioned. The book ends with a short discussion on the contemporary architecture of Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book features more than 180 sketches and colored photographs which are expanded to more than 350 in its second edition.

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arkitekturang Filipino</em></strong> recounts the history of architecture in the Philippines from the early settlements to the postmodern era, using the perspective and criteria of Filipino architecture or architecture which is the result of the Filipino&rsquo;s interaction with the environment and the many and diverse cross-cultural influences that came into the country over the centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The well-researched and well-illustrated book uses a multidisciplinary approach to the subject, drawing not only from urban history and architectural history but also fields such as sociology, economic history, anthropology, and even literary theory, all of which Lico says offer new perspectives on the subject and reveal the factors that influenced local architecture in terms of style, technology, planning theory, and conceptual imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is divided into eight chapters. In Chapter 1, &ldquo;Between the Earth and Sky: Early Philippine Settlers,&rdquo; Lico talks about the early human settlements in the Philippines and habitats such as caves and trees. Discussed here are the Tabon caves in Palawan, the rice terraces of the Cordillera, and the tree houses of certain Mindanao groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2, &ldquo;Philippine Vernacular Architecture and its Austronesian Ancestry,&rdquo; contains a detailed discussion of vernacular architecture in the Philippines and its Austronesian roots. It analyzes the regional house types of the Ivatan in Batanes and the traditional dwellings of the different ethnic groups in the Cordilleras as well as the lowland vernacular house, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut), and the architecture of the urban margins&mdash;the slum dwelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3, &ldquo;Muslim Space and the Philippine Islamic Architecture,&rdquo; deals with the structures associated with Islam and the Muslim groups like the Tausug, Maranao, and Maguindanaon in Sulu and Mindanao. These buildings include Muslim religious architecture like mosques and <strong>langgal</strong>, and secular architecture such as the forts, the <strong>torogan</strong> (datu&rsquo;s large house) and royal residences, and the stilt houses on the waters of the Sulu archipelago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4, &ldquo;Spectacle of Power: Hispanic Structuring of the Colonial Space (1565-1898),&rdquo; talks about early city planning in the country based on the&nbsp;<em>Leyes de Indias&nbsp;</em>(Laws of the Indies) of King Philip II, the development of Intramuros and its environs, the construction of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>simbahan</strong></a> (church) and other religious structures, waterworks, and utilities, and domestic structures such as the <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (stone house).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5, &ldquo;Imperial Imaginings: Architecture and Urban Design in the New Tropical Colony of the United States (1898-1946),&rdquo; deals with American period architecture, including public buildings&mdash;forts and camps like those in Pampanga and Baguio, the structures for health and sanitation, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\">Gabaldon</a> and other school buildings erected all over the archipelago. The works of American architects <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel Burnham</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a>, and the various architectural styles introduced during that period, like Beaux-Arts, art deco, and Streamline Moderne are also discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 6, &ldquo;Postcolonial Modernity: Architecture of Early Independence (1946-1960s),&rdquo; discusses the post-World War II reconstruction, the plans for the new capital Quezon City, the low-cost housing projects, the works of architects such as Federico Ilustre, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2708\">Jose Ma. Zaragoza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>. Buildings singled out are the innovative and technology-inspired styles of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Church of the Holy Sacrifice</a> in the University of the Philippines Diliman, the Commercial Bank and Trust Building on Quezon Blvd, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\">Araneta Coliseum</a> in Cubao, all in Quezon City. It also talks about churches of modern design like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/396\">Victorias Chapel</a> in Negros Occidental, the Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Baclaran, Para&ntilde;aque, and the now-demolished Union Church in Makati.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 7, &ldquo;Vernacular Renaissance and the Architecture of the New Society,&rdquo; reviews the architectural developments during the Marcos era and the Bagong Lipunan or New Society campaign to revive vernacular architecture. Lico focuses on government-commissioned structures which include buildings at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> complex like the Philippine International Convention Center and the Folk Arts Theater, the creation of the Nayong Pilipino in Pasay City, and the works of architects <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2674\">Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2679\">Felipe Mendoza</a>, and Leandro Locsin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the last chapter, &ldquo;Architecture of Pluralism and the Postmodern Urban Scenography,&rdquo; Lico reviews and analyzes the postmodernist cityscapes in the country such as the business districts of Ortigas, Makati, and the Bonifacio Global City. He also delves into the architecture of disjuncture with the College of Saint Benilde&rsquo;s School of Design and Arts as the main example, the mall culture, and the heritage-inspired architectural designs such as the McDonald&rsquo;s store in Vigan, Ilocos Sur which was constructed at the expense of the Spanish-era ruins of the brick seminary building and the recreated townscapes of subdivisions, such as the Ciudad de Calamba in Laguna. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Edgar Allan M.

		"text": "<p>[Spanish Architecture in the Philippines (1565-1800)]. Published 1959. Author, Maria Lourdes D&iacute;az-Trechuelo y Lopez-Spinola. Spain: Escuela de Estudios Hispano-Americanos de Sevilla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noted Spanish scholar Maria Lourdes Diaz-Trechuelo (1921-2008) built a name for herself among Filipino scholars and Filipinists for her work on Spanish colonial architecture, art, and history in the Philippines. For her doctoral dissertation defended at the Universidad de Madrid in 1955, she wrote about colonial architecture in the Philippines. This was based on documents in Spanish archives and without benefit of fieldwork in the Philippines. In 1956, she published &ldquo;Manila: Notas Sobre su Evolucion Urbana&rdquo; (Manila: Notes on Urban Development) which won the Luis Vives award of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC). Although she lectured, wrote, and published other works on Philippine topics, such as engraving, cartography, 18th-century economy, and the del Cuellar botanical expedition, it was the publication of her 1955 thesis that would be her seminal work, <strong><em>Arquitectura Espa&ntilde;ola en Filipinas (1565-1800)</em></strong> that had a lasting and profound impact on colonial architecture studies in the Philippines. That book linked her and Philippine scholars, eventually bringing her to the Philippines in 1977 to see first-hand the buildings and structures she wrote about in the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digging into Spanish archives which are filled with documents sent by friars and government functionaries to the Consejo de las Indias, Diaz-Trechuelo faced a mountain of information. This she systematized and presented in 13 chapters to which she appended 188 plates with the corresponding legends. <strong><em>Arquitectura&hellip;</em></strong> is a treasure trove of information not readily accessible to Philippine scholars unable to visit Seville&rsquo;s and Madrid&rsquo;s archives. Just the plates alone without the text constitute a valuable source of primary documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 13 chapters of <strong><em>Arquitectura&hellip;</em></strong> are: 1) &ldquo;Urban Development of Manila from its Foundation until the End of the 18th Century&rdquo;; 2) &ldquo;Military Architecture: Fortification of the City until 1700&rdquo;; 3) &ldquo;Military Engineers in the Philippines&rdquo;; 4) &ldquo;The Fortification of Manila Until 1762 and the New Project&rdquo;; 5) &ldquo;Military Architecture: The Execution of the Project&rdquo;; 6) &ldquo;Military and Civil Architecture&rdquo;; 7) &ldquo;Religious Architecture: The Manila Cathedral&rdquo;; 8). &ldquo;Religious Architecture: Sixteenth Century Foundations&rdquo;; 9) &ldquo;Religious Architecture: Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Foundations&rdquo;; 10) &ldquo;The Port of Cavite in the Seventeenth Century&rdquo;; 11) &ldquo;The Fortification of Cavite in the Eighteenth Century: The City and its Buildings&rdquo;; 12) &ldquo;The Episcopal Cities of Cebu, Nueva C&aacute;ceres, and Nueva Segovia&rdquo;; and 13) &ldquo;The Fortifications of Mindanao, Calamianes, and the Visayas&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During her long academic career, Diaz-Trechuelo mentored many students and even those in the Philippines who had not met her were alerted to the value of colonial documents in Philippine archives. The succeeding generation of scholars after the pioneers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel de Ayala</a>, Richard Ahlborn, and Benito Legarda would use archival material more extensively to paint a more nuanced and richer picture of colonial architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arquitectura&hellip;</em></strong> had many practical uses. When Intramuros&rsquo; walls were restored in the 1980s by the Intramuros Administration, restorers found relevant information in the book. Isabel Picornell, who wrote about the discovery of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, a defense tower built by Fr.

		"text": "<p>Published 1964. Author, Dominador H. Casta&ntilde;eda. Quezon City: University of the Philippines (UP) Office of Research Coordination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Art in the Philippines</em></strong> is the work of Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda (1904-67), artist and former dean of the UP College of Fine Arts (CFA) in 1956-61. It is a pioneering work that gives a comprehensive history of Philippine architecture, sculpture, and painting. It has 147 pages of text and 199 pages of illustrations, of which six are in color. The illustrations, although badly reproduced because of the limits of printing technology then, are an integral part of the book and arguably its more important contribution. It reproduces some vintage images like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> in ruins after World War II, Rizal Theater in Makati, now demolished, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/356\">Pardo Church</a> in Cebu without the &ldquo;Eye of God&rdquo; motif on its rose windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text is a pioneering work devoted to architecture, painting, and sculpture neatly spread across Casta&ntilde;eda&rsquo;s periodization of art history into Spanish, American, and the Modern period culminating in the 1960s. Casta&ntilde;eda interviewed a number of the architects and artists whose works are cited or discussed in the book and he also did research in the Philippine National Archives. Written in a narrative and descriptive fashion, the broad picture of Philippine architecture has the advantage of presenting factual information he gathered from the very practitioners who are the subject of his book, many of whom were his contemporaries and colleagues in the UP CFA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Casta&ntilde;eda&rsquo;s division of arts into architecture, painting, and sculpture betrays his academic and Western filter. Hardly anything is said about popular painting. His tripartite framework of Spanish, American, and Modern was the common framework used by critics and art schools when discussing art in the Philippines at that time. The framework is flawed for its assumptions that those who wield political and social power solely determine the flow of art, which is opposed to the belief that art arises from a variety of causes. Thus, when citing examples of the flow of art, he tends to focus on public buildings&mdash;civic and religious&mdash;as the indicators of the direction and trends in architecture. Except for a brief discussion on pre-Spanish dwelling, there is little said about the indigenous roots and traditions of architecture. It is then a history of the architecture from above, the big tradition rather than the small tradition. A similar viewpoint operates when he discusses sculpture and painting. Although the book&rsquo;s framework is dated, the data he amassed are still valuable and noteworthy. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>Published 1969. Author, P&aacute;l Kelemen. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hungarian emigr&eacute; and scholar of Hispanic architecture, P&aacute;l Kelemen (b. Budapest, 1894, d. La Jolla, California, 15 Feb 1993) with his wife, opera singer Elizabeth Hutchings Zulauf, as travel companion, photographer, and secretary, went on field research documenting the architectural and cultural heritage of Mexico. He belongs to a group of pioneering scholars, which included Manuel Toussaint, who documented and wrote about the uniqueness of colonial art and architecture and linked this with the influence of pre-Columbian art and architecture. He introduced the best canons of Continental criticism to elevate the study of American art to a level of discourse and respectability among art historians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Working with the concept of&nbsp;<em>mestizaje&nbsp;</em>or hybridity, Kelemen (like Toussaint who introduced the term <strong>tequitqui</strong>, referring to colonial architecture influenced by Aztec aesthetics) sought to demonstrate how European traditions were reinterpreted in the Americas to produce a new type of expression. Kelemen&rsquo;s masterwork detailing his explorations and observations is <strong><em>Baroque and Rococo in Latin America</em></strong> which, as Bullis B. Ashburnham observes, shows the huge leap in English-speaking people&rsquo;s appreciation of Latin-American art then. Kelemen also wrote about pre-Columbian art and culture, calling this America&rsquo;s ancient and medieval art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To project his scholarly work to a more general audience, he published <strong><em>Art of the Americas</em></strong> in 1969, which is a general survey of art and architecture from the precolonial period to the colonial era. Arden King criticized the way the arts were treated in &ldquo;a confusing geographical and chronological hodgepodge&rdquo; saying the book &ldquo;was not intended as a scholarly work and it certainly [did] not attain that status.&rdquo; However, he recognized Kelemen&rsquo;s conclusions about the native American element present in all these expressions, particularly in &ldquo;furnishings, utensils and jewelry and ornament.&rdquo; (King 1972, 119)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The chapter on the Philippines, &ldquo;A Different Flowering,&rdquo; was written by Kelemen because of his correspondence with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel de Ayala</a>, artist and author of <strong><em>Philippine Religious Imagery</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this chapter, Kelemen explores more fully what he had written in <strong><em>Baroque and Rococo</em></strong>, that a study of the great number of built structures in the Philippines will greatly enrich the study of art. He also demonstrates how the fusion of Oriental elements in the hardly photographed or studied (as of 1951) examples from the Philippines adds to the repertoire of Baroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the inadequacies of <strong><em>Art of the Americas</em></strong>, its influence on Philippine scholarship on heritage was considerable. It bolstered the confidence of Philippine scholars that the colonial style in the Philippines was unique, like its American version. It also introduced and popularized the term &ldquo;earthquake Baroque&rdquo; to describe Philippine churches. It alerted writers to the concept of hybridity and the search for the distinctively Filipino in the colonial. It was also about the only work on the topic in English in its time. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Cebu: Ramon Aboitiz Foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This monograph is a historical, cultural, anthropological, and sociological reading of a single heritage residence in Cebu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/284\">Casa Gorordo</a>, named after the prominent Cebuano family who gave Cebu its first Filipino bishop, Juan Gorordo (1862-1934), bishop from 1910 to 1932. The Gorordos purchased the house in 1863 from the Reynes family for 2,000 pesos. In turn, the Ramon Aboitiz Foundation, Inc. (RAFI) purchased the house from the Gorordos and converted it into a lifestyle museum. Published by RAFI, the book was launched in conjunction with the inauguration of the museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work has five chapters. Chapter 1, &ldquo;Introduction,&rdquo; spells out the intent and objective of the book, saying that this essay is about a house and the community where it is located. While both the house and district had been blemished by time and the house was not what it was when it was initially constructed, the essay nonetheless tries for a sociohistorical reconstruction. In this reconstruction, the urban development of Cebu from precolonial times to the present provides the context for the Filipino elite house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2, &ldquo;Rise of Urban Cebu,&rdquo; tells the story of Cebu from precolonial times to the modern era of urban Cebu. A fourth section is devoted to the Parian, Cebu&rsquo;s mestizo elite district as it evolves from a Chinese trading ghetto in the 16th century to the upper class residential district of merchants, professionals and landowners in the 19th and early 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3, &ldquo;Urban Residence in Cebu,&rdquo; is about reshaping of the landscape under colonial Spain, the emergence of the colonial residence in Cebu, and the life of Cebu residents during the colonial era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4, &ldquo;The Gorordo Residence,&rdquo; speaks about the four generations of the family who lived in the old house, including its most prominent member, Bp Juan Gorordo. The chapter also describes the house in great detail, its physical structure, parts, and furnishings as well as the lifestyle of the people who lived in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5, &ldquo;The Residential Complex in the Philippines&rdquo;, relates Casa Gorordo and the Cebu elite residential type to the rest of the Philippines and how the elite house has reconfigured not just the landscape but the people who live in them, in the way they act and structure societal relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is richly illustrated with old maps, early 20th century photographs and postcards, floor plans, facsimile of documents and line drawings, which enhance the appreciation and understanding of the elite house in Cebu. The book received the 1983 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5489\">Manila Critics Circle</a> National Book Award for Social Sciences. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>Published 1958. Author, Richard E. Ahlborn. <strong><em>Exchange News Quarterly</em></strong>; 1960 and 1963, <strong><em>Philippine Studies</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural historian and curator of the Division of Community Life of the Smithsonian&rsquo;s National Museum of American History, Richard E. Ahlborn went to the Philippines on a Fulbright grant in the 1950s. He was then a photographer for the Smithsonian&rsquo;s Department of Cultural History in the Museum of History and Technology. Aside from photographing the villages and peoples of the Cordillera, he photographed Spanish colonial churches and structures. He came to know a group of Filipino heritage enthusiasts who would pioneer in the study of colonial architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of his studies was projected to be a three-part series of which two were published. Ahlborn&rsquo;s research was done by a foreigner who had visited the Philippines and had seen the churches firsthand, unlike pioneers like Lourdes Diaz-Trechuelo or Pal Kelemen, who knew these churches only from archival sources and from correspondence with Philippine researchers and heritage enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the published articles, he adopted the term &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; to describe Philippine churches built during the colonial era, 1565-1898, a term commonly used by pioneer writers but which would later be critiqued or qualified. The article that appeared in 1958, &ldquo;Spanish-Philippine Churches: An Interpretation,&rdquo; is an overview, expanded in subsequent articles in 1960 and 1963. In the 1960 article about provinces near Manila, Ahlborn studies the churches in five provinces: Cavite, Bataan, Pampanga, Bulacan, and Rizal. For each place he writes a brief history, describes the church and sums up common characteristics of churches within a province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of Cavite he notes that most churches have an overlay of 19th century remodeling, grafted to the older church structure. Decorative elements from revivalist architecture, like Neo-Gothic arches are used, for instance, in Naic church. Cavite churches are also known for the following: first, the common use of the single aisle; second, the use of pilasters as articulation of the facade; third, the close-fitting cut stone of the facade; and finally the position of the bell tower generally sited to one side of the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bataan churches were constructed under the Dominicans. Frequent repairs, however, were done due to earthquakes and other natural calamities and to Bataan&rsquo;s seaside location, which exposed the churches to enemies, like the Dutch in the 17th century. Churches have thick plastered walls and recent repairs and renovations that hide previous works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Pampanga churches come from the 18th century, like San Fernando, Lubao, Guagua, Betis, and Bacoor. Church facades belong to the Renaissance Classicist style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bulacan, Ahlborn examined the church of Polo, Meycauayan, and Calumpit. Calumpit&rsquo;s distinctive carving made him remark that these were certainly the work of local Asian craftsmen who have elevated Western form and subject matter to a mystic level and made one of the most unique and stylistically vital churches in central Luzon. Bulacan churches, he observes, have a few characteristic features: Facades are mostly extremely flat and may be decorated only by thin columns and simple niches. Pediments are equally simple and usually triangular. Stone carving also preserves the surface&rsquo;s planar quality and these are usually well made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rizal churches are typified by those of Binangonan, Tanay, Morong, Guadalupe, Makati, and San Juan del Monte. Ahlborn notes that Rizal churches are relatively smaller than churches elsewhere. A good number have stonework often dating back to the first half of the 17th century. Morong&rsquo;s facade, however, was subsequently remodeled. This he describes at length, quoting Fr Felix Huerta, OFM, 1865. Stylistically, Rizal churches have relatively simple fronts, decorated by classical niches, cornices and columns and akin in its simplicity and straight forwardness to Classical renaissance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahlborn&rsquo;s digression into how churches were built is worth reading given the oversimplification of the building process that is still prevalent. He points out that, during the first half of the 18th century, the process of church building begins with the land and building being donated by a generous donor. Once the resources for construction are assured, permission to construct is secured from the government. The Padre produces a rough sketch, which native and Chinese artisans interpret and produce. The parish house or <strong>convento</strong>, bell tower, and school follow. Tax exemption is an incentive for working and contributing to the town church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1963 essay on churches of Central Luzon, Ahlborn begins with an introduction on the evangelization and colonization of the Philippines, and then organizes the essay as itineraries that radiate out of Manila as a hub. He develops each itinerary in an analogous way as his previous publication on places near Manila. After defining Central Luzon as the area from Tayabas Bay to Lingayen Gulf, he begins his itinerary: first, from Manila to Zambales, Lingayen, and North Pangasinan; second, to Batangas and Laguna; and third, to Cavite, Pampanga, Bulacan, Bataan, and Rizal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zambales churches have simple styles and a somewhat attenuated classical scheme. Botolan has a bulky belfry resting on the pediment, which houses a number of bells. Pangasinan has many large churches usually made of bricks rather than stone. Churches are characterized by 1) heavy brick surfaces; 2) splendid multi-tiered bell towers or campanarios; and 3) simple facades decorated with pairs of thin, round pilasters. The Batangas churches of Taal and Lipa, built in the 19th century, large and massive, are &ldquo;sufficient evidence of the eagerness and construction habits of the Augustinian missionaries in Batangas.&rdquo; Churches in Quezon that Ahlborn discusses are Lucban, Tayabas, Mauban, and Atimonan. The earliest missionary center can be found in Laguna. Stylistically, Laguna churches present a simplified native classicism in their renovated facades, which adjoin earlier bell towers of more dramatic European designs. Paete church stands out because it has outstanding carved decoration. Other characteristics of the Laguna churches are the carved side entrances and the wooden ceiling of Mudejar construction, that were interpreted by local builders. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>Published 1960. Author: Benito Legarda.&nbsp;<em><strong>Philippine Studies</strong> </em>8 (1), 121-58.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s Benito Legarda, noted economist and historian, Harvard graduate and one time deputy governor of research and board member of the International Monetary Fund, joined a group brought together by the artist and critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel</a>, which was interested in the colonial past. Aside from the author and Zobel, other members were Oscar Lopez and Armand Fabella. To focus his research, Legarda decided to work by regions because he believed each region had a basic homogeneity. However, due to limited time, the group was able to make only one major research trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legarda&rsquo;s &ldquo;Colonial Churches of Ilocos&rdquo; is the result of the group&rsquo;s forays. He would later extend his research to northeastern Luzon resulting in &ldquo;Angels in Clay: The Typical Cagayan Church Style&rdquo; in <strong><em>Filipinas Journal,</em></strong> 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essay on Ilocos is emblematic of Legarda&rsquo;s research pursuits. Questioning the opinion that &ldquo;Philippine colonial architecture, especially church architecture, was merely imitative of Spanish models and therefore unoriginal and uninteresting,&rdquo; (Legarda 1960, 121) he went on to do his own research to find out if it were so. Legarda followed the trail of writers on Mexican colonial architecture like P&aacute;l Kelemen who wrote about Spanish colonial architecture in the Philippines. Although this form was rarely photographed and still less studied, Kelemen showed how Spanish baroque spread through the islands. Although it was much altered, Legarda set out to look for what was unique in the Philippine examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He begins by clarifying that the &ldquo;Filipino element&rdquo; points to four aspects: first, the employment of local material by Filipino labor with Filipino expertise; second, use of local design, like local flora; third, the mingling of native elements with Spanish, Latin American, Chinese and other foreign influences and elements; and lastly, objects created for local use, became part of the local arena, and represent a mix of artistic elements located only in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing the Latin American with the Philippine experience, Legarda finds that the Spanish influence in the latter was much diminished. The Philippine builder had handicaps to overcome, among them lack of a tradition of stonework and few good models to study. In the Philippines, the influence of the Chinese was significant because they were frequently used to erect both religious and secular buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legarda characterizes the colonial Ilocano church according to different aspects, ranging from the ground plan (usually a simple rectangle) and size (quite large for the population) to longitudinal axis (an overwhelming majority faced the west or the sea) and bell towers (the detached tower is more common as one moves north). He noted earthquake baroque elements (broad walls or buttresses) and Chinese elements (<em>Fu</em> dogs and baroque angels fighting Chinese dragons in Aringay). The typical Ilocano baroque has a low profile, an angular pitch of the roof, the embellishment of columns or piers against the wall without pediments, and the existence of numerous finials molded like urns, knobs, and pyramids. Although evangelized by one group, there is no uniform architecture for churches erected by that group. Generally, the churches leave a feeling of simplicity, sincerity, straightforwardness, and strength. Nine churches are treated in greater detail. Sixteen pages of plates with multiple images of the churches discussed in the essay are appended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1981 essay &ldquo;Angels in Clay&rdquo; follows the same lines of research as the work on Ilocos. It speaks of the extensive use of clay for bricks and for decorative elements, finely made, some with the light touch of Rococo. It gives the history, description, and aesthetic assessment of unique churches in Cagayan Valley, like Tumauini with its oversized rose window that doubles as a pediment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essay ends with elegiac paragraphs on how Tuguegarao and the Cagayan Valley turned from a place of music to one of somber silence. In the closing days of World War II, residents sought the safety of the stone church where they hid their pianos and other precious heirlooms. Unfortunately, Americans bombed the Cagayan churches intending to flush out the Japanese who, it turned out, had long since gone. Legarda rued: Musical life in Tumauini changed after the bombing. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Chua. Quezon City: GCF Books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Folk</em></strong> <em><strong>Architecture</strong> </em>is the first full-sized book that deals with indigenous houses in different parts of the country. There are about a hundred cultural minorities throughout the archipelago and probably as many house styles. The houses of 14 of these are the subject of the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1 is devoted to houses of the Cordillera peoples: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a>. The Kalinga houses include those of Upper and Lower Kalinga; Bontok houses, those of the towns of Bontoc and Sagada; Ifugao houses, those in Banaue and Mayoyao; and Kankanaey houses, those of the Northern and the Southern Kankanaey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 is an essay on the bamboo houses of Panay, ethnic houses still, but a departure from the precolonial tradition. Unlike the one-room dwellings of the Cordillera and Mindanao peoples, the Panay houses have several rooms, neatly defined by partitions. The Panay houses are notable for their ingenious use of bamboo for decoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3 covers the vast area of Mindanao and Sulu, describing the boats and houses of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> (Badjao) and the houses of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>. A short section describes the stone and thatched houses of the Ivatan in Batanes, and the houses of the Mangyan in Mindoro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from weather reports, architectural descriptions, and accounts of construction, the essays include myths, accounts of building rituals, various beliefs on houses, and lists of household furnishings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photographs taken in the early years of the American regime and in the 1980s show that the Cordillera and Mindanao houses had not changed much through most of the 20th century, though they are now, as the introduction bewails, an endangered species, a disappearing breed. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>(Intramuros from 1571 until its Destruction in 1945) Published 1958. Author, Pedro Ortiz Armengol. Madrid: Ediciones de Cultura Hisp&aacute;nica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Written by former Spanish ambassador to the Philippines Pedro Ortiz Armengol, the book belongs to the pioneering wave of studies of Spanish colonial architecture in the Philippines. Ortiz Armengol worked in close contact with the Zobel family in Manila, whose scion Fernando took interest in colonial religious statuary, and with a group of other scholars, writers, and collectors photographed and documented colonial remains. He also worked with Spanish historical repositories in the Museo Naval, where he obtained reproductions of the drawings of the Malaspina Expedition, and the Section of Engravings in the Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid. He also worked with Philippine repositories like the American Historical Collection and the then yet to be organized Ayala Museum. Andres Ortiz Armengol did line drawings, especially, details of the 18th century map of Manila by Fernandez Roxas, 1727. Arch Manuel Ma&ntilde;osa drew some of the plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Intramuros de Manila</em></strong> is a single, straightforward narrative essay divided into 76 illustrated sections, between two and four pages long. After a preliminary essay the narrative begins with the entry into Manila of the Spaniards under Martin de Goiti, sent by Legazpi from Pan-ay in 1570. The narrative continues with the coming of Legazpi, the take over of the Rajah Sulayman&rsquo;s palisade, and the establishment of Spanish Manila. The narrative is combined with descriptions of the construction of the walls of Intramuros and the principal edifices of church and state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ups and downs of the city are narrated: its rise as the entrep&ocirc;t of the tripartite trade between China, the Philippines, and Mexico, aka the Galleon trade; the destruction of the city by fire, earthquake, and war and its rebuilding; the threats to its existence with the attack of Limahong in the 16th century; the Dutch Wars of the 17th century; the British occupation 1762-64; and the city&rsquo;s utter destruction in 1945.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book skillfully extracts information from maps and illustrations, demonstrating that these visual evidences from the past are an important area of research. The book in particular extracts information from the 1727 Map of Manila, drawn by Antonio Fernandez de Roxas and commissioned by Gov Fernando Valdes Tamon. This map shows isometric drawings of buildings and dwellings in Intramuros and the nearby districts like Binondo and Santa Cruz, Bagumbayan, and the Parian beyond the city moat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Intramuros de Manila</em></strong> is a popular and vivid account of the historic core of the city of Manila, its great resilience and ability to rise and be reinvented after every calamity. Line drawings, architectural plans, and illustrations enrich the narrative and descriptions. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>(Manual for Buildings and Fortification for the Campaign in the Philippines) Published 1882. Author, Manuel Herbella y Perez. Madrid: La Imprenta Memorial de Ingenieros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not well known except to specialists is the manual of Manuel Herbella regarding the construction of fortifications in the Philippines. Published toward the end of the Spanish era, this two-volume work consists of an&nbsp;<em>Atlas&nbsp;</em>of 47 pages consisting of 23 plates with multiple figures; and a&nbsp;<em>Texto&nbsp;</em>(Text) of 430 pages. Both the Atlas and the Texto are divided into two&nbsp;<em>Tratado&nbsp;</em>(Treatises)&mdash;I:&nbsp;<em>Construccion&nbsp;</em>(Construction) and II:&nbsp;<em>Fortificacion&nbsp;</em>(Fortification).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herbella, assigned for a long time to the Corps of Engineers in the Philippines, wrote in the&nbsp;<em>Prologo&nbsp;</em>(Prologue) that his intent was to put down in writing and document material and methods of construction to update construction in the Philippines, which had not changed much since early Spanish rule. His other intent was to paint a picture of the type of battles soldiers would face in the unique situation of the Philippines. Thus, Treatise II on fortification goes beyond describing and explaining techniques of construction to present an anthropological description of the tribes of the Philippines and outlines a strategy of using both field and permanent fortifications in bringing them under Spanish control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While much of the data about unpacified groups may be found elsewhere, e.g. Jos&eacute; Montero Vidal&rsquo;s <strong><em>Historia de la Pirateria Malayo-m</em></strong><strong><em>ahometana en Mindanao, Jolo</em></strong><strong><em>y Borneo</em></strong> (History of Malay-Mohammedan Piracy in Mindanao, Sulu and Borneo), 1888, Herbella gives a visual insight into military architecture in the 19th century. Furthermore, the utility of Herbella&rsquo;s manual goes beyond military architecture because he documents the use of indigenous material, like nipa thatch (Treatise I, Plate 6), and methods of wood joinery, roof truss designs, and techniques of hewing wood used in other types of 19th century construction, like residences and churches. Thus, the manual is a useful guide for the conservation and restoration of late 19th century structures. Significant, too, is Treatise II, Plate 1, which documents Moro weapons and the Balanguingui fort at Sipac, attacked in 1848 by Spanish troops under Gov-Gen Narciso Claveria. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Oshima. Drawings, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3432\">Manuel D. Baldemor</a>. Quezon City: GCF Books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This comprehensive and authoritative study examines the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na&nbsp;</strong><strong>bato</strong></a> (stone house), which represents the apex in the development of indigenous Filipino architecture from the precolonial period to the American colonial regime. In the bahay na bato the native-house form expanded and was enriched by Western design, particularly by styles of decoration, forming a synthesis that characterized urban, upper-class Filipino culture of the time. The text is complemented by a wealth of photographs and drawings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay na bato has its origin in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay&nbsp;</strong><strong>kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut)<em>,</em>the bamboo-and-thatch one-room dwelling built on stilts and covered by a steep roof. Other house forms that emerged in the Philippines contributed to the evolution of the bahay na bato, namely, the house of the native nobility, the houses built by the Spanish residents of Intramuros, and the <strong>convento</strong> that adjoined the parish church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tropical rain, the heat and glare of the sun, the dampness of the ground, and the frequency and intensity of earthquakes dictated the form and construction of the bahay na bato and challenged the ingenuity of its builders to devise features, such as the elaborate system of windows, that would make the house well adapted to its setting and comfortable for its occupants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction of the house is recounted, from the moment that trees are felled to the laying of the roof. The various rooms and their functions are described, as well as the marks of grandeur that made the house a status symbol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An extensive examination of houses in numerous regions of the country enabled the authors to identify styles&mdash;the geometric and the floral, as well as regional and revivalist styles&mdash;and to place these in historical sequence. Zialcita devotes a chapter to questioning the use of &ldquo;Antillan&rdquo; to describe the bahay na bato. The final chapter pays tribute to the Villavicencio house in Taal, Batangas, which played a part in the Reform Movement, the 1896 Revolution, and the Philippine-American War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the basis of descriptions contained in a will, a 17th-century house in Intramuros is drawn to scale, with floor plans, elevation, and an isometric view of the interior. The book includes short essays on building beliefs, the first Filipino architects, ghosts, and housekeeping, as well as lists of building materials, furniture, and revivalist styles. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p>Published 1972. Author, Alicia Marquez Lim-Coseteng. Manila: UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines, Mercury Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book may be said to have closed an era. It builds upon the data and insights accumulated over the previous decades by scholars, like the Mexican Manuel Touissant, the pioneering work of Maria Lourdes Diaz-Trechuelo y L&oacute;pez-Spinola, <strong><em>Arquitectura Espa&ntilde;</em></strong><strong><em>ola en Filipinas</em></strong> (Spanish Architecture in the Philippines)<em>,</em>1959, and the works of Armengol in 1958, Legarda in 1960, Casta&ntilde;eda in 1964, Kelemen in 1969, and earlier, Ahlborn in 1958-1963 on colonial churches, and Zobel de Ayala on Philippine religious imagery in 1964. With these works behind her, Coseteng delineates the first synthetic picture of Philippine colonial architecture during the Spanish era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Divided into nine chapters, with a preface, introduction, glossary of chiefly architectural terms, index, and a folio of 159 photographic plates (mostly by Silverio Enriquez) and 37 illustrations or architectural sketches (some from archival sources, others drawn by Sammuel Alapan), the book is a sound and easy introduction to colonial architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1, &ldquo;Historical Background,&rdquo; distinguishes Philippine architecture from Spanish and Hispanic/Mexican colonial architecture and decries the comparison of Philippine architecture with foreign examples as &ldquo;invidious&rdquo; (Coseteng 1972, 3). Coseteng points to the uniqueness of Philippine architecture caused in part by the archipelago&rsquo;s physical separation from Mexico and Spain and its situation in Asia. Because of distance, very little personnel versed in architecture crossed the Pacific from Mexico. Likewise no Filipino, until the 19th century, crossed to Mexico and Spain. An opportunity then arose for the emergence of the mestizo Chinese Filipino builder, some of whom we know by name. Juan Antonio de Ayco, Jeronimo Quibon, and Jacinto Caba worked on the Cebu Cathedral. Andrea de la Cruz and Pedro Eulogio gave estimates for the cost of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/397\">Vigan Cathedral</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2689\">Bartolome Palatino</a> who worked on Morong church and Miguel Guanco are other names recorded. Aside from personnel, local conditions both physical and cultural, shaped architecture. Construction methods were simple: post and beam structure, the use of local materials and <strong>tabique</strong> (partitions) and the prevalent use of tropical hardwood. <strong>Conventos</strong> or parish houses, more than churches, hewed closer to the vernacular type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2, &ldquo;The Mission Complex,&rdquo; relates Philippine types to Mexican models, which consisted of a church and a convento contiguous to it. Both face an open atrium, which may have a fence and <strong>capillas posas</strong> (small outdoor oratories) at the four corners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3, &ldquo;Characteristics of Colonial Churches,&rdquo; list these as follows: (1) The rectangle was a commonly used church plan; (2) Churches were fortress-like and had thick walls; (3) Interior flow was straightforward in plan; a nave leads to the apse where the main <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> is built. A variation of the rectangle is cruciform where minor retablos are located at the transept; and (4) A choir loft, a timber-roofing structure like an inverted boat, and a bell tower complete the standard church. Coseteng cites unique examples like the Majayjay choir loft that extends to lateral galleries and the detached bell towers of Ilocos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4, &ldquo;The Cathedrals,&rdquo; traces the history of the Cathedrals of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/397\">Vigan</a> (Nueva Segovia), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/286\">Cebu</a>. It describes these cathedrals and notes how the triple nave is used in their design. Coseteng also adds the churches of Jaro, Lipa, Molo, and Taal in her discussion, because these churches are also triple-naved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapters 5-9 are an overview of colonial churches divided geographically, more or less. Chapter 5, &ldquo;The Churches of Manila,&rdquo; gives a history and description of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a> in Intramuros, and the churches of Binondo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/331\">Malate</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/376\">Santa Ana</a>. Chapter 6, &ldquo;Religious Architecture in the Ilocos,&rdquo; divides the area into Ilocos Sur, with the churches of Vigan, Candon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/378\">Santa Maria</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/375\">San Vicente</a>; and Ilocos Norte, with the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/267\">Bacarra</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/382\">Sarrat</a>, Dingras, San Nicolas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/355\">Paoay</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/317\">Laoag</a>. Chapter 7, &ldquo;The Churches of Bohol and Cebu,&rdquo; include those of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/339\">Maribojoc</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Baclayon</a>, Tagbilaran, Dauis, Dimiao, Talibong, Cortes, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/323\">Loon</a>, all in Bohol; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Santo Ni&ntilde;o</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/280\">Carcar</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/346\">Naga</a> in Cebu. Chapter 8, &ldquo;The Churches of Iloilo,&rdquo; discusses the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/390\">Tigbauan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao</a>, and Guimbal. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/353\">Pan-ay</a> which is in Capiz, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">Argao</a> in Cebu are under this chapter. Tigbauan offers Coseteng the opportunity to introduce the term <strong>tequitqui</strong>, coined by Mexican&nbsp;writer Jos&eacute; Moreno Villa to describe Mexican colonial architecture with marked influence of native aesthetics. Chapter 9, &ldquo;The Baroque Churches of Rizal, Laguna and Bicol,&rdquo; is about the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">Morong</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\">Tanay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/351\">Paete</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/328\">Majayjay</a> in Rizal and Laguna, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/292\">Daraga</a> in the Bicol region. The book ends abruptly with this chapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coseteng&rsquo;s pioneering work has large gaps and sudden jumps. There is little discussion on the Bicol churches, which is understandable considering the difficulty of traveling to these places in the late 1960s, when the data for the book was being gathered. Also the organization of the book, while appearing to be geographical (Chapters 5-9) is in fact not entirely so, because stylistic and architectural features play a role in the choice of examples. This explains why <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/344\">Molo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">Taal</a>, which are not cathedrals are included in Chapter 4. The connection is that both are triple-naved. Argao appears in Chapter 8 which is on Iloilo because it is ornamented like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/390\">Tigbauan Church</a>. And the churches of Santo Ni&ntilde;o, Carcar, and Naga in Cebu are grouped together because these show characteristics of Muslim art, which, according to Coseteng, one sees more as one travels south. The term &ldquo;Muslim art&rdquo; is misleading and that confusion is noted in her statement: &ldquo;Features of Muslim art were adopted during the colonial era for purely artistic effect, whether they were [a] spontaneous, if unconscious expression of a latent or artistic tradition, it is quite difficult to be arbitrary about&rdquo; (Coseteng 1972, 85). The phrase &ldquo;latent or artistic tradition&rdquo; seems to suggest that the Muslim influence came from Mindanao. And this innuendo later becomes fact, when later popular writings misquote or misinterpret Coseteng. More precisely what the author labels &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; should be called Mudejar&mdash;its roots are not in Mindanao but in Spain and the artistic tradition enjoyed a revival during the second half of the 19th century. Whatever Mudejar characteristics there might be in the Cebu churches these do not come from the Philippines. For example, Naga&rsquo;s Mudejar touches come from the architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2652\">Domingo de Escondrillas</a>, who was assigned to the public works office in Cebu. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

Ayala Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is a study of church art of the Spanish colonial period. It deals mainly with forms, avoiding discussion on styles. The author&rsquo;s aim is a modest one, namely, to give both scholars and laymen a framework on how to analyze colonial church artistic forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1 is a short account of the introduction of Christianity in the Philippines, which includes brief notes on the religious orders that evangelized the natives&mdash;Augustinians, Franciscans, Jesuits, Dominicans, and Recollects. The contribution of the secular clergy is given due attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 and 3 are on church construction. From the <strong>tuklong</strong> <em>,</em>a church building of light materials, came the general plan and form which carried over to the stone church. The various parts of the stone church are explained: walls, roof, ceiling, vaults, floor, facade, buttresses, interior spaces, dome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4 presents the furnishings in detail, particularly the main altar and its ornaments. Descriptions of the pulpit, the choir loft, and the baptistry are also made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5 takes the reader through the <strong>convento</strong> or parish house, a part of the church to which earlier literature on churches paid little attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The making of santos or religious images, the printing of religious pictures, and a history of religious painting are the subjects of Chapters 6 to 8, while the final chapter is an inventory of treasures in the sacristy: vestments, chalices, censers, monstrances, reliquaries, and other ceremonial items made of precious metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This slim volume thoroughly covers all that can be called church art, from architecture to altar linens, and includes as well an entertaining assortment of curious details, such as the use of cow&rsquo;s blood to paint walls and the various recipes for mortar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book received the 1991 National Book Award in art from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5489\">Manila Critics Circle</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Wood</em></strong> <em><strong>and</strong> </em><strong><em>Stone...</em></strong> is a study of the architecture of Jesuit churches in the Philippines. It begins with an account of the development of Philippine towns in accordance with the 1573 decrees of Philip II and the establishment of the town church. The introductory chapter also discusses the association of the Jesuits with baroque architecture and gives a history of Il Gesu<em>,</em>the Jesuit church in Rome, a product of Renaissance and baroque styles, which became a model for churches throughout the world, including a few in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After paying tribute to the Jesuit priests and brothers who designed and built churches in the Philippines between 1581 and 1768, the author describes in detail the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/262\">Antipolo</a>, destroyed in 1945; Taytay, destroyed in 1898; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/383\">Silang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1461\">Lobo</a>c, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/307\">Guiuan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/314\">Kawit</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/271\">Boac</a>, and Santa Cruz; and the altars of San Ignacio and Antipolo, both destroyed; and those of Silang, Boac, Santa Cruz, Loboc, and Baclayon. Upon their restoration in 1859, the Jesuits went into building churches with renewed vigor. The most eminent Jesuit landmark from that period was the second <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">San Ignacio Church</a> in Intramuros which was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas</a> and adorned with woodcarvings by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a>.
