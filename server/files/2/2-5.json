		"text": "<p>An <strong>apartment</strong> is a multi-unit residential building generally built in urban areas. A unit within this building is also called an apartment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The burgeoning economy, brought about by international trade during the second half of the 19th century, increased Manila&rsquo;s population. To house this growing population, existing <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\">bahay na bato</a> </strong> (stone houses) were subdivided to house many tenants. In commercial districts where the bahay had an <strong>entresuelo</strong> (mezzanine), this particular area was rented out to tenants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two types of apartment buildings appeared during the American colonial period: the <strong>accesoria </strong> (row house) and the multistory, multi-unit residence. The row house continued to be built to accommodate the growing urban population during the reconstruction following World War II. These houses usually had two stories, occasionally three stories or, alternatively, two stories with a mezzanine. Each residential unit had its own entrance and was separated from its neighbors by a firewall. Sometimes, the individual unit had a carport. The first floor contained the living room, dining room, toilet, and kitchen. The bedrooms were located above, accessible through a flight of steps. Some row houses were built of concrete, others of concrete on the first story and wood on the second. The cheapest were almost entirely of wood. A number of 1950s row houses can still be found in the Malate-Ermita districts, while row houses of the 1960s can be found all over Metro Manila. The term &ldquo;accesoria&rdquo; continued to be used for these rented low middle-class housing, whereas the term &ldquo;apartment&rdquo; was applied to the better appointed residences.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The townhouse seems to have developed from the idea of row houses or apartment units. With the rising cost of urban land, the need for a compromise between the necessity of living several stories above the ground and the desire for a single detached house with its own grounds led to the development of townhouses around the 1970s. The townhouse makes it possible to use limited space in urban areas while departing from the typical boxlike structure of row houses and apartments. Some variations are designed around a common open area with facilities like a swimming pool and playing courts. Ownership of townhouses may also mean an interest in the common area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, townhouses do not go beyond three stories and are complete residential units sharing a common wall with a neighbor on either side. Depending on the target market, materials used range from modest to luxurious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multiple stories and units of an apartment may share a common main entrance. A number of units may occupy the same floor and share the same corridor that leads to the main entrance. The units are complete dwellings that include the living room, dining room, kitchen, bedrooms, and bathrooms, all on the same floor. An example of this apartment type is the Syquia Apartments on Adriatico St (formerly Dakota) built ca 1937. This apartment building is composed of four towers that share a common open space enclosed by a wall and tall gate. Each tower contains about a dozen living units. This type of apartment is the precursor of the condominium, which&mdash;more than a particular architectural form&mdash;is a new form of property ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1970s the condominium (from Latin&nbsp;<em>cum</em>, &ldquo;with,&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>dominiums</em>, &ldquo;ownership&rdquo;) first appeared. The growing economy and the increased buying power of the growing population are two of the major factors influencing the development and proliferation of condominiums. Republic Act No 4726, or the Condominium Act, defines a condominium as &ldquo;an interest in real property consisting of a separate unit in a residential, individual, or commercial building and an undivided interest in the common, directly or indirectly, land in which it is located and in the common areas of the building. A condominium may include, in addition, a separate interest in other portions of such real property.&rdquo; Ownership of the condominium unit therefore means ownership of the residential or office unit itself and a portion of the common spaces, such as a parking space and perhaps a rooftop laundry area (Feliciano 1991).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Condominiums, popularly called &ldquo;condos,&rdquo; are generally multistory with central service cores for elevators and stairways. Units are designed for compact living and are small by the standards of those used to living on the ground. The lack of space is usually compensated for by amenities such as air-conditioning, communications equipment, and the accessibility of business and commercial areas. Condominium units can range from a small one-room affair, called a studio, to a unit with living room, dining room, bedrooms with their individual bathrooms, and a well-appointed kitchen. Not just a variation on the architectural form of residences, condominiums have revolutionized forms of ownership. Condominium units are also used as business offices and may be owned by corporations rather than by individuals or families. A condominium building may also be of &ldquo;mixed use&rdquo;&mdash;i.e., spaces are owned by shop operators, business entities, and residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interiors of condominiums and townhouses depend largely on the personal taste and income of the occupant, whether owner or tenant. More expensive units are complete with modern amenities. Townhouse developments that target the middle class are usually simple spaces with basic amenities, which the owner can modify by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/215\">redesigning interiors</a> to suit personal taste and budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The private sector is the more dominant participant in residential and real estate development and focuses on high-yield units, like condominiums and townhouses. The target for these units is the high-income group, like expatriates, foreign entrepreneurs, and local people in search of high-yielding investments. This system of private initiative, which flourishes through free trade, has created lopsided development in favor of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">urban centers</a>, where infrastructure such as transportation and communication is already in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples of early condominiums are the Legaspi Towers, built in 1974, on Roxas Blvd; the Renaissance Towers in Pasig, 1989; and Pacific Plaza in Makati, 1992. Luxurious townhouses may be found in New Manila, Greenhills, and the Bonifacio Global City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toward the end of the 1980s, condominiums proliferated not just in Metro Manila but also in provincial urban centers. The boom in high-rise condos has been catalyzed not just by a growing population but also by investors and financial speculators, both local and foreign. New sections of the cities are the areas where development is taking place, such as the Bonifacio Global City (the former Fort Bonifacio), the foreshore of Pasay in Metro Manila, or in Laguna from Santa Rosa southwards. In Iloilo, the area covers the old airport and surrounding places in Mandurriao. In Cebu, the development is southern part of the city toward Talisay and up the mountains to Busay and Talamban and the hills of Guadalupe. Many of the new developments are spearheaded by large corporations like Ayala Land, SM Development Corporation, Filinvest, and Mega World. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ana Maria M.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>bahay kubo</strong> (from Tagalog&nbsp;<em>bahay</em>, &ldquo;house,&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>kubo&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;hut in the fields&rdquo;) may be regarded as the indigenous, lowland Christian house. However, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> (Badjao) also use the term <strong>kubu</strong> to refer to the indigenous large <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/228\">houseboat</a> of the&nbsp;<em>panglima&nbsp;</em>(community leader).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay kubo is often seen as a solitary house in the middle of ricefields. When there are many of them, they are lined along seacoasts and riverbanks, strung along roads and highways, or clustered together in fields and groves. Usually owned by peasant families and other low income groups, the bahay kubo traditionally evokes the rural idyll. Such is the image imprinted in every Filipino child of the folk song <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\">&ldquo;Bahay Kubo&rdquo;</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p>Bahay kubo kahit munti,<br />\r\nAng halaman doon ay sari-sari:<br />\r\nSingkamas at talong, sigarilyas at mani,<br />\r\nSitaw, bataw, patani,<br />\r\nKundol, patola, upo at kalabasa;<br />\r\nAt saka mayroon pa, labanos, mustasa,<br />\r\nSibuyas, kamatis, bawang at luya;<br />\r\nSa paligid-ligid ay puno ng linga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(The nipa hut, however small,<br />\r\nHas a variety of plants:<br />\r\nTurnip and eggplant, winged bean, and peanut,<br />\r\nStringbean, hyacinth bean, lima bean,<br />\r\nWhite gourd, sponge gourd, white squash, and orange squash;<br />\r\nAnd then there&rsquo;s radish and mustard,<br />\r\nOnion, tomato, garlic and ginger;<br />\r\nAnd all around are sesame seeds.)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay kubo retains the features of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\">indigenous house</a>&mdash;namely, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">pile construction</a> and the hip roof; in addition, it has push-out or sliding windows for added ventilation, a necessity in the hot and humid climate that prevails in these areas most of the year. Some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">hispanic influences</a> are evident, such as the altar for the resident family&rsquo;s santos, and the benches, tables, and other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furnishings</a> required by hispanized manners. Although commonly claimed to be of hispanic influence, the <strong>silid</strong> or <strong>kuwarto</strong> (room), where the women of the house could change clothes in private, already existed prior to hispanization, as attested to by early chroniclers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay kubo consists of a <strong>balkon</strong> or <strong>beranda</strong> (front porch) that opens to a square or rectangular multipurpose <strong>bulwagan</strong>, the main room of the house, on one side of which is the <strong>silid,</strong> a small room for household storage. The bulwagan leads to the <strong>kusina</strong> (kitchen), usually with a separate roof, and finally to an open-air <strong>batalan</strong>, a back porch which serves as a cleaning or washing area, or even as bathroom. The house is entered through the front porch or through the batalan via a removable bamboo ladder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The balkon is one step, or around 15 cm, lower than the floor of the bulwagan. As the receiving room of the house, its windows are much wider than those of the main room and are often decorated with fanciful latticework made out of short bamboo slats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The all-purpose bulwagan functions as a sleeping area at night. During the day, it serves as dining, work, and entertainment area. Originally there was just the floor and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\"><strong>dulang</strong></a> (low table) for dining; later a built-in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\"><strong>papag</strong></a> or <strong>papagan</strong> (long bench of split bamboo) was introduced, along with other furnishings, as a result of Spanish contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A silid is not only a changing area especially for the women but also for the storage of pillows, rolled mats, and the <strong>tampipi</strong> (chests and woven trunks) for the household&rsquo;s personal belongings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To keep a fire from spreading and to ensure a clean interior free of smoke and grime, the kusina is built on the ground level but still connected to the main house by a shed or lean-to type of roof. Alternatively, it may be built as a separate structure like a mini-version of the main house. The latter may be joined to the main house by a corridor or a bridgelike passageway, which could serve as a dining room. More often, however, the kitchen is part of the main house, on the same floor level or a step lower, with a roof of its own. Unlike the bulwagan, it is a more open area with the slats of the walls and flooring spaced wider so that during cooking time, smoke easily escapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The batalan is an open porch usually connected to the kitchen and is raised for better sanitation, as it is almost always wet here during the day. Its floors are somewhat loosely arranged lengths of whole bamboos cut from the bases of old stems. Some batalan are built on the ground level, their boundaries marked by a fence. Big jars of water are kept in the batalan for drinking and washing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>silong</strong> (space under the house) is used only to store farm and fishing implements, mortars and pestles, and other heavy or bulky articles. This space is a source of ventilation for the house, especially if the floor of the house is of slats set slightly apart. It may be open sided, or it may have walls of vertical or crisscrossed bamboo slats to keep pigs and poultry in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>kamalig</strong></a> is a separate storehouse for palay (unhusked rice) and is built following the form of the main house and with similar materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>House forms and materials of the bahay kubo vary, depending on the local terrain and climate. Thus, in areas frequently ravaged by typhoons, houses tend to be low and squat, elevated by about half a meter, like those in Bicol. Where heat and humidity are more oppressive, houses tend to be taller, with the floor about 3-3.5 m above the ground, and more spacious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variant of the bahay kubo is the temporary shelter built in the kaingin (swidden farms) in the uplands, or in the middle of the rice fields or fishponds in the lowlands. It is a resting place or occasional dwelling for the farmer whose home is far from the place of work. The hut is a one-room structure, raised on stilts, roofed with thatch, and provided with thatch or bamboo sidings. Alternatively, it could be nothing more than a roofed platform. Part of it is used for keeping tools and implements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite local variations, the bahay kubo is basically a house of bamboo and nipa, hence its English translation, &ldquo;nipa hut.&rdquo; These materials account for the buoyant, seemingly cool and easy feel of the house. However, for all its lightness and rather humble appearance, its construction demands special skill and artisanship and, in fact, a building technology of its own. For instance, traditional folk wisdom dictates that bamboos be cut only in season&mdash;i.e., at the start of the bamboo&rsquo;s resting period, which covers a mere 20 or so days each year: from the start of the&nbsp;<em>misa de aguinaldo&nbsp;</em>(nine-day dawn masses before Christmas) to the Feast of the Epiphany, or from 16 Dec to 6 Jan. During this time, bamboos are already mature and no new leaves or branches are produced; the sap flow is sluggish; and tissues are poor in starch and sugar, and thus can no longer attract the&nbsp;<em>bukbok&nbsp;</em>(powder-post beetle). To ensure that all insects are eliminated, the cut bamboo stalks are first soaked in river or lake water, or buried in the sand for some six months. Of the 30 or more different species of bamboo in the Philippines, only three or four may be used in house construction, the best of which is the <strong>kawayang tinik</strong> (spiny bamboo).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nipa is planted between the months of May and August, during the rainy season when the soil is wet. When mature, this plant rises to about 3 m and its long leaves acquire a rich green color. When used for thatching and walling, nipa leaves are doubled up, sewn together, and then dried.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">roofing materials</a> include bundled cogon grass, rice stalks, sugarcane leaves, split bamboo, anahaw, and other palms. <strong>Sawali</strong>, split bamboo, coconut leaves, abaca leaves, and anahaw are used for wall sidings. Rattan is used for lashing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building a house is no simple matter. First, an auspicious site for a dwelling is selected, then blessed with prayers to ward off evil spirits. Certain omens are observed and rites performed before, during, and after construction. The proper orientation of various house parts such as the door and the ladder, or even of the house itself, is important because these are all essential to the prosperity of the family and the strength and stability of the house. A house that faces the east is generally considered lucky. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> of Panay island believe in a mythical dragon, Bakunawa, whose position in the sky determines the winds. One must know where the Bakunawa faces before beginning construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next step involves the erection of the posts, followed by the installation of the floor joists. After this, construction shifts to the roof and from there works downward to the <strong>dingding</strong> (walls), then the windows and the doors. All these stages are marked by rituals: coins are placed in the holes of the principal posts to ensure the financial stability of the family; blood from a slaughtered chicken or goat is smeared on the carpenter&rsquo;s tools and the posts of the house to ward off any misfortune that might befall the carpenter, his tools, and the house being built; and, as a house blessing rite to ensure a happy home, a new pot containing water is dropped to wet the whole floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An outstanding feature of the bahay kubo is the highly flexible planning and arrangement of house units to give free, easy interaction and movement to people within and outside the house. Thus, a great sense of interdependence and community develops among its occupants as they sleep, eat, and work together in this one-room setting. Here one mingles freely with nature, and with family, friends, and neighbors in a spirit of harmony and togetherness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay kubo remains an iconic architectural type, although it is being built less and less in the rural areas. Some huts have been replaced by houses made of concrete and galvanized steel as family fortunes improve. However, the bahay kubo has found new incarnations, such as the cabanas in resorts and gazebos in gardens. Architects such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2674\">Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa</a> have used the bahay kubo as an inspiration for contemporary architecture. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (from Tagalog&nbsp;<em>bahay&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;house&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>na bato&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;of stone&rdquo;), also known as <strong>bahay kastila</strong> (Spanish house) and <strong>bahay na tisa</strong> or <strong>balay tisa</strong> (house of tile), are residences of the well-to-do, built in many towns during the 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay na bato has certain basic features, though it has undergone changes in the course of its development and varies according to region. It generally has two stories, sometimes three. The ground floor is of cut stone or brick; the upper, of wood. Grilles protect the ground floor windows, while second-story windows are wide, with sliding shutters whose latticework frames are either shell or glass panes. Below the <strong>pasamano</strong> (window sill), alternative windows reach to the floor. Called <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows), these are protected with either iron grilles or wooden <strong>barandillas</strong> (balusters) and have sliding wooden shutters. Above the whole house is a high hip roof&mdash;i.e., sloping on four sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most surviving examples of the bahay na bato date back only to the 19th and early 20th centuries, although the form developed during the 17th century as a fusion of three traditions: the indigenous, the Spanish, and the Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Houses in the islands during the precolonial period followed a pattern common throughout Southeast Asia. They were of frame construction with floors raised high above the ground. Such houses stood on stilts, like spiders on many legs. Thus, they protected the occupants from the humid ground, seasonal floods, insects, wild animals, as well as human enemies. The resulting space below the floor served as a work space and animal pen. Thatched roofs, hipped or gabled, were steeply pitched to let rainwater flow down quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commoners lived in small houses with floors and walls of split bamboo. The nobility enjoyed houses that were considerably larger and had hardwood floors and walls. Largest and tallest of all was the chief&rsquo;s house. The rooms were many, according to the 17th-century missionary Francisco Alzina, SJ; and the floors, of several levels. There were nine or even 11 posts on each side, and three ridge-poles. Carvings ornamented the houses. Sulayman, lord of Manila, dwelt in a house of substantial proportions, which stored many precious goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Spaniards conquered Manila in 1571, they established a settlement and initially constructed their buildings in the local manner. But after an accidental fire consumed the city, many structures were rebuilt in stone quarried from the cliffs of Makati&mdash;namely, volcanic tuff, which came to be locally known as adobe. By this time, the Chinese were flocking to the islands in increasing numbers to settle. A newly arrived Jesuit, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a>, taught both native and Chinese workers the Spanish way of making tiles and building houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The all-stone houses that appeared were tile-roofed structures that were tall and spacious, with many windows, balconies, and iron grilles. They were said to resemble their contemporaries in Spain and Mexico. Still, not all housebuilders abandoned wooden construction. A detailed list from 1617 of all houses in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> indicates that slightly more than half were of wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strong earthquake shook Manila in 1645; many stone buildings collapsed. While the massive stone houses were fireproof, they were too rigid during earthquakes. On the other hand, the local frame houses swayed with the shocks. Because of this, a synthesis emerged. The entire house was now supported by <strong>haligi</strong> (wooden pillars) following the native style. The upper story would be of wood, the lower story of stone, giving rise to the <strong>arquitectura mestiza</strong>. The roof would be either of curved tile or of thick thatch. Tiles had the advantage of being fireproof, but because they were laid in several layers, they could easily fall through during tremors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A will drawn in 1699 describes an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/360\">Intramuros house</a> belonging to a widow, Do&ntilde;a Isabel Navarro de Pi&ntilde;ero. It had many wooden pillars, each with a diameter measuring 1.67 m. Adobe was used largely for the ground floor walls that were 1.12 m thick. The wooden upper story had <strong>balcones voladizos</strong> (balconies) projecting over the street. These could be closed with latticework shutters with panes made out of capiz shell. Such shutters did not yet slide as would become the norm in later houses; instead, they could be swung out. The idea of having latticework panels for windows came from the Chinese artisans, for such were used in China to hold either translucent rice paper or oyster shells. Glass became cheap all over the world only during the 19th century. Below the shell windows were ventanillas reaching down to the floor. The over-hanging balconies shielded the interior from the sun while allowing air to flow in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1699 will does not mention a ceiling, the rafters and beams were surely exposed, as was the case in Intramuros houses of the following century that the Frenchman de Guignes described.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The floor plan of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/360\">Pi&ntilde;ero house</a> typified a pattern that would last till the 1890s. The ground story had storage rooms and a porter&rsquo;s room. A stairway in two flights led to the rooms above. The first was a large <strong>corredor principal</strong> (corridor) at the top of the stairs. This opened into a hall called <strong>canon,</strong> probably because of its length, which extended to the street side. Most likely, the canon was a receiving room. Beside the canon were two <strong>camaras</strong> or <strong>cuartos</strong> (bedrooms). The <strong>cocina</strong> (kitchen) stood behind the house as a separate structure but connected to it by a walkway. Beside it was an outhouse of wood. The L-shaped floor plan of the house provided a rear courtyard with a well to the side. There were clear continuities with the earlier native tradition of confining the family&rsquo;s living activities to the upper story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This wood-and-stone style of construction spread through the islands. The development of the wood-and-stone style during the 18th century deserves exploration. Two of the very few 18th-century houses that survive are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/313\">Jesuit House</a>, 1730, in Cebu City, and the Incon House, ca 1734, in Loboc, Bohol. The picture clears up from the 1780s onward. Many buildings of this period are found all over the country; moreover, numerous descriptions and house plans are available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 1780s to the 1880s, houses followed a style that can be called &ldquo;geometric.&rdquo; In this style, the flying wooden gallery, now called either the <strong>galeria volada</strong> or <strong>corredor</strong>, extended along the exterior walls. It had two sets of sliding shutters: the outer one of <strong>concha</strong> (shell) and the inner of wooden <strong>persiana</strong>, or jalousies or louvers. An intervening wall of plastered brick separated the volada from the adjacent rooms. Wooden doors opened out into the volada. The wooden gallery brought in light and air, and screened out excess sunlight, for during this period, roof eaves were just a narrow strip. In the middle of the day, shell shutters were pushed to the sides, and the half-open jalousies drawn instead. When it rained, the reverse occurred. The drawn shell shutters brought in light. Still, not all houses of the period had a galeria volada that could be closed on both sides. In others, the rooms extended all the way to the exterior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Surface decorations were minimal: shells in squares and diamonds on the window panels, and friezes with simple, neoclassical motifs; hence the term &ldquo;geometric.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 19th century the huge pillars that characterized the house documented in 1699 had shrunk to 50 cm or less. They either stood exposed or were enclosed within stone or brick walls almost a meter thick. Stone or brick were bonded with mortar and received a coating made of lime mixed with either egg whites or the sap of local plants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In geometric-style houses, wooden ceilings and partitions enclosed the rooms. Ceilings were high, as much as 4 m or so, to enable the hot air to float up. To facilitate circulation of air, the <strong>calado</strong> (wooden fretwork panel) began to appear in the wall space between door and ceiling. The idea may have come from the Chinese who decorated their walls with traceried panels. On the other hand, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> (Badjao) did use <strong>lauwa-lauwa</strong> (&ldquo;cobweb&rdquo;), calado-like panels on their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/228\"><strong>balutu</strong></a> or <strong>kubu</strong> (large houseboat), which was the residence exclusive to their&nbsp;<em>panglima&nbsp;</em>(community leader). Although now obsolete, a few derelict balutu with the lauwa-lauwa were anchored at Tawi-Tawi in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>zaguan</strong> (ground floor) of the bahay na bato housed carriages, old furniture, and saints&rsquo; floats. Sometimes it had an <strong>entresuelo</strong> (mezzanine) for offices and servants&rsquo; quarters. This was elevated 1 m from the often humid ground. Windows were protected from intruders by <strong>barrigones</strong> (literally, &ldquo;big bellies&rdquo;), aka <strong>buntis</strong> (&ldquo;pregnant&rdquo;), which were bulging iron grilles. <strong>Cuadra</strong> or <strong>caballeriza</strong> (stables) were located outside the house proper on the other side of an open courtyard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A two-flight stairway led from the zaguan to the upper story. The <strong>caida</strong> (receiving hall) could serve as both receiving and dining room, particularly in some big houses. However, other houses distinguished between the <strong>antesala</strong> (anteroom) and the <strong>sala</strong> or living room. Near the sala was the <strong>comedor</strong> (dining room). In some houses the kitchen also doubled as both cooking area and dining room on ordinary days. Kitchens with exterior walls of either cut stone or brick lessened the threat of fire and thus became common. Connecting the kitchen to the toilets and the bathrooms was the <strong>azotea</strong>, a raised stone porch with ceramic banisters. This porch had many purposes. As it stood either beside a <strong>balon</strong> (well) or over an <strong>aljibe</strong> (cistern), food preparation and laundry activities took place here. It was also a convenient nook for cultivating many potted plants that were useful for cooking and healing. The multipurpose character of the common rooms and the notion of a kitchen-porch was another carry-over from the humble bamboo hut to the magnificent wood-and-stone house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, the house was occupied by a large extended family consisting of a couple, their children, and their grandchildren. Yet the bedrooms were few, often just two or three, for the children often slept together on large mats rolled out on the caida or the sala. At certain times of the year, particularly during the town fiesta and Holy Week, the house became a community center because the owners were obliged to feed all who came to revere the holy image that they kept&mdash;regardless of the devotee&rsquo;s social background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extant examples of the geometric version are the houses of the Ilagan (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Taal</a>), Constantino (Balagtas), Quema (Vigan), Syquia (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>), Lizares (Talisay), and Gorordo (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1863 and 1880, earthquakes rocked Manila, destroying many houses. New ordinances decreed that house posts were to be thinner but connected to each other by many braces for more flexibility. Thin brick panels were inserted between the braces. In the new Manila houses, both brick panels and posts had almost the same thickness, 21 cm. Where brick was not readily available, the house posts stood beside the walls to prevent these from cracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another ordinance discouraged the use of curved tiles and instead encouraged the use of either imported corrugated-iron sheets or flat tiles. The former became popular because it seemed sturdier and easier to install. Unfortunately, without a high ceiling beneath it, it radiated the sun&rsquo;s heat into the rooms. However, since iron roofs were relatively lighter, they could extend well beyond the exterior walls to create wide eaves, which had soffit vents to provide outlets for hot air gathering under the roof. Windows were further protected by <strong>tapancos</strong> or <strong>media aguas</strong> (metal awnings) made of artfully shaped tin sheets. <strong>Desagues</strong> (tin tubes) or downspouts conducted rainwater from the roof to the ground below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since these innovations protected the house walls from rain and sun, the volada, as a closed corridor, became obsolete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Post-1880 houses had more expansive space than their forbears because of these innovations. Moreover, they made more use of wood for the upper-story walls. Sidings were sometimes of wooden panels adorned with <strong>bandejados</strong> (oval, platterlike forms). Glass, sometimes frosted, sometimes in multicolored harlequin, became increasingly common; thus, rooms became brighter. The calados widened and extended from post to post, and their fretwork took the form of butterflies, flowers, or lyres. Floral motifs proliferated all over the exterior as well: in the soffit vents, the corbels, and the iron grilles. Hence, this style of the bahay na bato, which lasted from the 1880s to the 1930s, can be called the &ldquo;floral.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other innovations differentiated the floral from the geometric. The roofs became more varied in form. For instance, Swiss-style jerkinhead roofs became popular. By the roof rose a <strong>mirador</strong> (tower) for surveying the distance and for keeping more plants. As walls in the ground floor became thinner and therefore less humid, bedrooms for family members were built in the entresuelo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The floral version is typified by the houses of the Pamintuan (Angeles), Tecson (San Miguel de Mayumo), Bautista (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a>), and by the interiors of the houses of the Pastor (Batangas City) and Avenido (Alaminos, Laguna). Villavicencio&rsquo;s gift of a Taal house to his bride Gliceria Marella, in the 1870s, is floral in conception.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">Furniture</a> and furnishings were many and diverse. Philippine furniture and painting did attain a zenith in these houses. Finely carved consoles, chairs, and tables of hardwood abounded in the antesala, the sala, and the comedor. On the walls were locally executed easel paintings and murals, together with imported lamps and mirrors. Ornate four-poster beds dominated the bedrooms, which had side closets, chests, and chests of drawers. Sir John Bowring, British diplomat, commented in 1859 that these houses were &ldquo;not, as often in England, overcrowded with superfluities.&rdquo; Photographs and surviving interiors from the 1880s to the 1900s suggest a healthy sense of moderation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of regional variations of the bahay na bato. In the Ilocos region, especially Vigan, walls on both stories are of plastered brick, which encase a wooden frame. Exteriors have undecorated pilasters and simple, continuous cornices. &ldquo;Vigan House,&rdquo; the popular term for denoting a house with a lower story of stone and an upper story of wood, is therefore misleading. The plaster is sometimes tinted light indigo, for Ilocos used to export the dye. Houses like those of the Mercado in Bustos, Bulacan, also use stone for both stories. But the corner posts are carved into bunches of slender pillars, while bas-reliefs of stylized flowers and crosses decorate the exterior wall space between window sill and floor. Some houses in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/425\">Silay</a>, Negros Occidental, like that of the Gamboa, have cusped arches at the ground floor porches. Other notable houses in Negros Occidental are those owned by the Locsin and Gaston in Silay and the Lizares and Claparols in Talisay. One of the best representations of the bahay is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/284\">Casa Gorordo</a> in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay na bato as a house form began to decline in the 1930s. But its influence persists to this day. Many a house in both town and village has a ground floor with hollow-block walls and an overhanging upper floor of wood. Farmers in Ilocos often prefer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>capiz</strong></a> panes to glass. Although ventanillas are no longer provided, the space beneath the windows in many houses from the 1950s to the present continues to be differentiated from the adjacent wall surface by a frame. If the house is of concrete, plaster bas-reliefs or bricks adorn this space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wood-and-stone house of the 1800s to 1930s marks a high point in the development of a truly urban Filipino style. It took note of both earthquakes and climatic conditions and was thus eminently secure and comfortable. While it acquired ornate ornamentation during its final phase, at its best it exercised restraint. The beauty of many a house from that period resides in its proportions and its balancing of empty with filled space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, appreciation for the achievement of this style has been hampered by the insistence on calling it &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; or&rdquo; Antillan.&rdquo; As has been pointed out, it is a unique fusion of three building styles and is found only in the Philippines. Alzina in the 1660s called it &ldquo;mestiza,&rdquo; for it blended wood and stone. Engineers sent over by Madrid during the 19th century referred to it as &ldquo;el sistema adoptado en el pais&rdquo; (the local style), which they preferred to the all-stone &ldquo;European style&rdquo; because of its clear advantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also no evidence that house styles in the Philippines are mere copies of the Antillan, a form identified with the Antilles island group in the Caribbean. The authentic Antillan or Caribbean houses used stone for exterior walls in both stories and had projecting open balconies which had neither sliding shell shutters nor shuttered ventanillas. At the turn of the 19th century, some houses, like that of the Claparols in Talisay, did sport long, continuous balconies like those in Cuba. But they were the exception rather than the rule. Moreover, they had very un-Cuban upper stories of wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the provinces, continuities with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut) are obvious. Kitchen and even dining room floors sometimes had no floorboards. Instead, they consisted of timber joists that could be walked on; thus trash was easily swept into the ground below. Although ceilings may be coffered, they are made of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>sawali</strong></a> or woven bamboo strips. The way of life within the gentry&rsquo;s mansion is often just a more upscale version of life in the traditional hut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another reason why such houses are labeled &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; is the mistaken notion that their residents were Spaniards. In fact, peninsular Spaniards were always numerically small in relation to the population. The occupants of such houses were locals: mestizos and Christianized natives, all of whom would eventually call themselves &ldquo;Filipino&rdquo; to differentiate themselves from the peninsular Spaniards who monopolized high positions in the state and the church. Indeed, by 1840, the authorities noted with alarm that a significant proportion of home owners in Intramuros were&nbsp;<em>indigenas&nbsp;</em>(natives) and mestizos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The residents were either professionals or members of the land-owning elite who resembled 19th-century elites elsewhere, even in noncolonized states. Democratic ideals had yet to be absorbed, although many residents did play important roles in the emergence of nationalism. Still standing are the houses where lived Fr Jose Burgos (Vigan); Emilio Aguinaldo (Kawit); the Luna brothers (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>); Gregoria de Jesus, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s widow, and her second husband <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4093\">Julio Nakpil</a><strong><strong> </strong> </strong> (Quiapo); Gliceria Marella (Taal), who gave the doomed First Republic its one and only warship; and Manuel Hidalgo (Tagbilaran), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s brother-in-law who was exiled to Bohol, and whom Rizal visited there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing an alternative name for these houses has not been easy. &ldquo;Bahay na bato&rdquo; suggests an all-stone house, which it is not. &ldquo;Bahay na bato at kahoy&rdquo; or the &ldquo;wood-and-stone house&rdquo; might be more accurate. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5798\"><strong>Fernando N.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>barong-barong</strong>, also known as <strong>balong-balong</strong>, <strong> banlag</strong>, <strong> hayub-hayub</strong>, <strong> lagkan</strong>, <strong> pala-pala</strong> <em>,</em>and <strong>payag</strong>, are shanties of informal settlers&mdash;i.e., dwellings of the landless poor, built on whatever land they can occupy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Informal settlements in the Philippines began when the Walled City of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> was built as an enclave of the Spaniards. The hills, marshlands, and islets beyond the walls consisted of Parian, Dilao, Malate, Ermita, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, Tondo and Quiapo, which all became settlements of Filipinos, Chinese, and other nationalities that streamed into the country as traders. The settlers&rsquo; population expanded as transport along the Pasig River and numerous esteros or waterways of Manila became accessible, hence enabling small businesses to flourish. During the 1920s, jobs became available as the port area and commercial districts of Manila prospered, attracting more urban migrants. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong>Accesorias</strong></a> (row houses) were built to solve the problem of the rapid influx of migrants. Additionally, World War II dislocated residents in the country, hence swelling the homeless population in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">Informal settlers</a>, also called the &ldquo;urban poor,&rdquo; are generally migrants from the countryside who come to the urban areas in search of jobs and a better life. Unable to acquire or rent property, they build makeshift dwellings on public land or idle private property. After World War II these settlers discovered that, despite the cramped conditions of the barong-barong, they could still rent out space. Thus, the barong-barong itself became a new source of income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Informal settlers initially use spacious idle lands for planting vegetable or raising animals. As the population increases, small businesses, such as&nbsp;<em>sari-sari&nbsp;</em>(variety) stores and repair shops, ease out the agri-business activities. The number of dwellings in such settlements ranges from less than 10 to several hundreds. Barong-barong sites include the&nbsp;<em>tabing-dagat&nbsp;</em>(bayshore),&nbsp;<em>tabing-ilog&nbsp;</em>(riverbanks), esteros, along the&nbsp;<em>riles&nbsp;</em>(railroad tracks),&nbsp;<em>barangay basura&nbsp;</em>(garbage dumps), road easements, abandoned buildings, and the space along high masonry walls around exclusive villages. Barong-barong have been built under bridges and in the hollow of sea walls. Their sites are generally near their places of livelihood. Larger settlements have shanties built close together along narrow alleys or around a common space. In villages built on mud flats or swamps, houses are on stilts and connected by plank bridges.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The barong-barong may be divided into two types: continuous houses and detached houses; or single-room houses, one-story multiple-room houses, and two- and three-story houses. These structures are the primitive or folk architecture of the present time, since they are dwellings of minimal space, made of found, scavenged, or recycled materials, and crudely assembled by the house owners with the help of neighbors. Their areas range from 6 to 30 sqm or more. A small one would have a single all-purpose room; a large one could have a living space, a dining nook, a kitchen, bedrooms, a porch, and an alcove for storage. Rare is one that has its own bathroom and toilet. However, barong-barong vary in size, plan, exterior appearance, and construction; no one description can fit them all. The barong-barong is an organic house that increases its rooms either vertically or horizontally, or both: a single-room house may grow into a one-story multiple-room house, to a multistory house or commercial structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The posts, beams, joists, and rafters could be of wood or bamboo, depending on what is readily available. The roof, usually of one slope, is of scrap corrugated, galvanized iron sheets, flattened biscuit tins, metal sheets from billboards, scrap plywood, tarpaulin, plastic sheets secured with fishnets, cardboards covered with plastic sheets, canvas, old mats, linoleum, or nipa. The ceiling, if headroom allows it, serves as insulation; it could be of plywood, styrofoam, sawali (woven bamboo strips), or plastic sheets.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Since roofs are often made of materials that cannot be nailed on, they are held down by improvised weights&mdash;rocks, concrete hollow blocks, discarded battery casings, rubber tires, bicycle wheels, upholstery springs, wooden blocks, and plastic jugs. The floor may be the ground itself or an existing pavement. It could also be raised above the ground by 50-200 cm or more. When the floor is the ground itself, it is covered with plastic sheets, sections of advertising tarpaulin, or a mosaic of bottle-caps. In some shanties, fragments of concrete blocks or cement tiles are used to form a pavement. Elevated floors are of wooden boards, scrap plywood, <strong>lawanit</strong>, or bamboo slats. Wooden floors are sometimes covered with linoleum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sidings are a patchwork of galvanized iron sheets, lawanit, bamboo, nipa, sawali, cardboard, discarded billboards, dismantled crates, <strong>capiz</strong> shutters, and plastic sacks. Tin cans planted with hardy ornamentals hang from rusted interlink wire. For additional protection, the sidings are lined inside with plywood, cardboard, plastic sheets, or thick paper. The materials used for sidings are also used for door and window shutters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside, the shanty may have auxiliary structures or spaces, such as a <strong>batalan</strong> (unroofed porch), which is a work area with a floor slightly lower than that of the house or on ground level covered by an extension of the roof. Some shanties have a small entrance porch adorned with iron grilles or balustrades. The minimal floor area of the barong-barong is matched by its low ceiling. Depending on where the shanty is located, it has either only one window or windows on two, three, or four sides. Should there be more than one room, partitions would be of light materials&mdash;cloth, cardboard, or a wooden lattice. Sometimes a free-standing&nbsp;<em>aparador&nbsp;</em>(cabinet) serves as a partition. In two-story shanties the stairs are as steep as ladders in order to save space. Cooking utensils are hung underneath the stairs. The upper floor or loft, used as a sleeping area, has a low headroom</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The furniture and appliances in a shanty are the index of the family&rsquo;s standard of living. Some households have only the barest necessities&mdash;a wood-burning or a single-burner gas stove, water jugs, cartons for storing clothes, sleeping mats, and sometimes, a folding tabletop that is hinged to the wall and supported by an 80-cm high removable post. Some houses have more comforts: chairs, tables, cabinets, beds with mattresses, an electric fan, a sewing machine, a refrigerator, and a television set. Outside the house could be an array of potted and hanging plants. Electric power in informal settlements is accessed from power lines by means of jumper cables, and water is diverted from public water pipes with the informal settlers&rsquo; makeshift ones. Waste disposal and garbage collection are haphazard. Thus, the Republic Act No 7279, the &ldquo;Urban Development and Housing Act of 1992,&rdquo; was passed to provide informal settlers with &ldquo;decent housing, basic services, and employment opportunities.&rdquo; These were to be made possible with socialized and economic housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However poor a house may be, it usually does not lack an altar or shrine. In a corner, on a long shelf, or on top of a cabinet stand images of the Holy Child, the Sacred Heart, the Blessed Mother, San Roque, San Martin de Porres, and other popular saints. Next to these may be posters of half-nude women tacked to the wall.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>bungalow</strong> (from Anglo-Indian &ldquo;bungalow,&rdquo; of Bengala) was originally a one-story house built in India, characterized by a tile or thatch roof and a wide front porch. The term also referred to a vacation house in the country. In America the bungalow is usually a flat-roofed, one-story house, like those common in California.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines a bungalow is a one-story house unit with large windows, and sometimes a lanai or a terrace. The lanai, borrowed from Hawaii, is a roofed terrace walled on one, two, or three sides. Bungalows were introduced in the Philippines during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American colonial period</a>. Those built in the 1920s and 1930s had a spacious porch on the front and sides. Although the porch was an important element of the bungalow, this was sometimes reduced to a small vestibule in front of the main entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bungalow could be compact in plan or sprawling, slightly elevated above the ground or practically on ground level. The bungalow, in reduced and simplified form, has become a model for low-cost housing. During the 1950s government-financed housing unit projects had a basic format. A unit had one small living room, one or two bedrooms, and a bathroom. As a single, detached unit, it had its own entrance but, instead of a fence, it had a hedge. Its roof was either of asbestos or galvanized iron. Of the variations in structure, the most common were the single unit and the duplex.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">Project communities</a> have developed according to income bracket. The low-cost houses, specifically those in the Quirino district&mdash;i.e., Projects 2 and 3&mdash;were characterized by windows with wooden jalousies. In Project 4, the area bounded by Aurora Blvd, P. Tuazon, and J.P. Rizal; Project 6, Pag-asa district; and Projects 7 and 8, Mu&ntilde;oz-Congressional district, single-unit bungalows had bigger lots, more rooms, and sometimes swing-out glass windows. The earlier houses in Projects 2 and 3 lack what later Philippine bungalows adapted as protection against the tropical sun and rains&mdash;i.e., elements from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house), such as the pitched roof and the <strong>media aguas</strong> (metal awnings).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Villages called Barrio Obrero became ubiquitous in the 1950s. These were villages with the most basic type of bungalow built for the working class. In Bacolod City, Negros Occidental, Barrio Obrero was originally a village for the wage earners of the sugar mill and permanent workers (as opposed to the seasonal workers) of sugar plantations. Barrio Obrero in Iloilo City was a resettlement site for hundreds of families rendered homeless after the great fire of 1951. It stands on a reclamation area that used to be swampland. Classified as an &ldquo;urban poor&rdquo; area, it was selected as a model housing project area for the Slum Improvement and Resettlement Program of the National Housing Authority (NHA), after a visit of then Pres Corazon Aquino in 1986. Although the types of houses here vary according to the livelihoods of the residents, basic bungalows with standard toilets are found farther inland, in contrast to the <strong>barong-barong</strong> on bamboo stilts standing on the coast. In Davao City, the old barrios or housing projects that were originally built with bungalows include Barrio Obrero and Juna Subdivision. GSIS Heights Matina, also in Davao City, has one septic tank for the entire village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bungalows of the middle class stand on 200- to 400-square-meter lots. A typical house has a carport, a spacious living and dining area, a kitchen, two to three bedrooms, a small garden in front of the house, and a service area at the back. Bungalows in Philamlife, Quezon City, are constructed in blocks around a common space with a plaza which has a park, a playing court, a church, and a clubhouse. They are also found in Singalong and Santa Mesa. Bungalows became especially popular during the post-World War II period of reconstruction in the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the rural areas, solitary modest bungalows for hands-on farm owners began to appear in the middle of farmsteads in the 1950s. Alternatively, plantations owners, such as those in Negros Occidental, had luxurious bungalows built in the capital city to serve as their weekend home; on weekdays they lived in their two-story pre-World War II <strong>balay nga daku</strong> (plantation mansions).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, more upper-class bungalows were built in Makati villages such as Forbes Park and Magallanes, as well as in New Manila. The main house in these subdivisions occupied a 1,000- to 2,000-sqm lot which contained sprawling bungalows with gardens, atriums, lanais, swimming pools, garages, and maids&rsquo; quarters. Similar villages also appeared in cities outside Manila, such as the Santa Clara Subdivision in Bacolod City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However large or intricate, the Philippine bungalow has always had problems with ventilation. Its usually low ceilings, enclosed rooms, and inadequate windows reduce air circulation and thus tend to make the house warm. Floods can also be a threat to bungalows built right on the ground in low-lying areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the increase in land prices and a growing population, the single-detached residence like the bungalow has become a luxury in an urban setting. Here the trend is to build condominiums with living areas as small as 19 sqm. While 200- to 400-square-meter lots can still be found outside <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">urban centers</a> in new housing developments, even there the price of a lot of such size can be prohibitive. Houses built in such subdivisions usually have two stories, on lots that could be less than 100 sqm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While rising real estate prices might be forcing the bungalow out of the market, it is still being built in seaside resorts designed as single or duplex detached houses. The bungalow continues to find new ways of existing in the changing landscape of residential houses. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Annaliza B.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>casa real</strong> (royal house), also identified as the <strong>cabildo</strong> (town hall), <strong>casa de ayuntamiento</strong> (council house), <strong>casa municipal</strong> (municipal house), and <strong>gobierno</strong> (government) was the center for civic rule during the Spanish colonial period. It was usually built near or opposite the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>, overlooking the plaza. The ruling body of a town, called cabildo or ayuntamiento, met in the casa real; hence the casa real was, by extension, called &ldquo;cabildo&rdquo; or &ldquo;casa de ayuntamiento.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its construction was part of Spain&rsquo;s strategy not only to Christianize the Philippines but also to hispanize it. The erection of civic structures, such as the casa real, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>casa tribunal</strong></a> (courthouse and jail), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a> for boys and girls, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a>, and watchtowers, complemented the building of ecclesiastical structures and served as an index of a town&rsquo;s westernization and financial solvency.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In theory, each town had a tribunal, a separate primary schools for boys and girls, and a casa real. But well into the 19th century, these structures were absent in many towns because of the towns&rsquo; inability to pay for their construction. In theory, civil government paid for all civil construction; but, in fact, many of these structures were built by the townsfolk themselves, without help from central government and often under the direction of the parish priest, the&nbsp;<em>alcalde mayor&nbsp;</em>(governor) or other local officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The casa real also served as lodging for dignitaries who came to visit a locality. In cases where the casa real was never built, visitors took to staying in the <strong>convento</strong>, or the parish priest&rsquo;s residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases, the casa real did not represent a special type of architecture. It was akin to the convento, which in turn was an oversized <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). Normally, these were two-story structures with a lower floor of stone and an upper floor of wood. For example, the two-story casa real built in Cabatuan, Iloilo, in the late 19th century had a lower story of stone and an upper story of wood. Large overhanging eaves, windows with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">capiz</a> shutters, and <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows) mark the casa as belonging to the bahay na bato genre. The casa real of Balanga, Bataan is also an enlarged bahay na bato. The cabildo of Pasig, Rizal, had two stories and an arcade in front of the first story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One-story structures were also built, such as that in San Fernando, La Union, built with four bays on either side of the central section of the facade but which had been renovated during the American colonial era and eventually destroyed during World War II. The cabildo at Boac, Marinduque, was built not along the church plaza but at the foot of the hill, where the church-fortress stands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, the casa real assumed monumental proportions fit for the seat of government. Examples are those of Bacarra, Ilocos Norte, completed in 1900 but probably started during the previous century, and the cabildo of Mahatao, Batanes, which is a two-story stone structure pierced by narrow grilled windows in the manner of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2353\">Ivatan</a> house. There was often no physical difference among the tribunal, cabildo, casa real, and even the school houses; moreover, over time the same building might be used as a court of law, school, and lodging. Thus, the names of these civic buildings are commonly interchanged in popular parlance, with the term &ldquo;casa real&rdquo; as the most common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of growing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">heritage awareness</a>, attention has been turned to deteriorating but still standing casa real, resulting in the project of restoring and rebuilding them. The casa real in Lingayen, Pangasinan, built in the mid-1800s, stood intact and functioning until it was severely damaged by a typhoon in 2008. In 2002, the National Historical Institute declared it a National Historical Landmark for being &ldquo;an outstanding example of civic architecture from the Spanish period.&rdquo; As such, plans for the restoration of this building were being initiated as of 2016. The casa real in Argao, Cebu, built perpendicular to the tribunal, has been restored and presently functions as the municipal hall. The casa real of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a>, also known as <strong>casa presidencia municipal</strong>, was built of stone in 1767 and then of brick and mortar in 1786, rebuilt in 1843 and renovated in 1918.

		"text": "<p>Buildings for commercial purposes may be divided into those designated for the buying and selling of goods, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">markets</a>, and those which house business offices, banks, and factories. Only the second group of commercial buildings is here discussed, with the first group being found under the entry <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">&ldquo;Palengke.&rdquo;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The very first large commercial building in the country was probably the Alcaiceria de San Fernando, inaugurated in 1758 in the populous Chinese village of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, just across the river from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>. The two-story octagonal edifice housed not only several shops for the Chinese merchants but also government offices for the control of trade. Destroyed by fire in 1810, it was not rebuilt, perhaps because by then many other stores and shops had already opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After the opening of the Philippines to international trade, British, German, French, and other foreigners set up businesses on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a> and adjacent streets, so that by the second half of the 19th century this had become the most important commercial district in the country. Most of these houses engaged in the import and export of goods. Early trading houses were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) adapted for commercial purposes. The ground floor was occupied by offices, while the upper floor served as the residence of the owner of the firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the more active architects in the design of commercial buildings was the Spaniard <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2661\">Juan Hervas</a>, who was the municipal architect of Manila from 1885 to 1893. To meet the commercial needs of the city, Hervas designed the offices of Rafael Perez on Anloague St (now Juan Luna) in Binondo, the Ynchausti Brothers office along the waterfront, and the Purchasing Agency Office. He is credited with designing the Manila Railroad Station at Tutuban, the terminal of the railway that ran up to Dagupan. He also designed commercial buildings: Estrella del Norte, the Heacock Store Building, the Paris-Manila building, and the building occupied by the American Bazaar, all on Escolta St; and the Hotel de Oriente building and the La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory, both at Plaza de Binondo (now Plaza San Lorenzo Ruiz). With its intricate <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Moorish motifs</a>, the La Insular is a good example of a building that combines commerce and art.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Related to the rise of commerce was the establishment of banks. Between 1823 and 1829, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\">Aduana</a>, or customs house, was built in Intramuros along the banks of the Pasig. The first bank, the Banco Espa&ntilde;ol-Filipino de Isabel II, precursor of the Bank of the Philippine Islands, was housed in the Aduana until the bank moved in 1862 to its own quarters in Intramuros. The second bank, the Monte de Piedad, originally at the Colegio de Santa Isabel in Intramuros, moved to a new building at Plaza Goiti (presently Plaza A. Lacson) in Santa Cruz. The bank, designed by Hervas, had a facade similar to that of Greek temples, in accord with the current neoclassic style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The establishment of American rule and the improvement in the economy fostered the construction of office buildings. In the late 1920s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, chief architect of Manila from 1920 to 1924 and son of the painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3634\">Juan Luna</a>, designed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\">Perez-Samanillo Building</a> on the Escolta. The building was one of the first to use art-deco ornaments. Luna later designed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/288\">Crystal Arcade</a>, also in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> idiom, which was considered the most modern building in Manila before World War II. It combined shops with office space. Notable buildings of prewar Manila were the Paterno Building and the Cu Unjieng Building, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo Sr</a>; the Regina Building by Andres Luna de San Pedro; the Geronimo de los Reyes Building (now Soriano Building) and Capitan Pepe Building by Juan Nakpil; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5618\">Ramon Roces Publications</a> Building by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>. Most preferred was the art deco idiom, which was a decorative style and not a new program on the use of space. Most office buildings contained similar elements: a lobby on the first floor, and elevators and stairs that led to the upper floors. On each floor, corridors led to rooms for offices. The first floor also had office spaces or stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architecture of the 1950s was influenced by the International Style, which favored asymmetry and used bold rectangular forms, plain wall surfaces, clean lines, and large windows. Sunbreakers were used in many buildings as a protection against intense tropical sunlight. Notable commercial buildings of this period are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/358\">Philamlife Building</a>, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2635\">Carlos Arguelles</a>; the Capitan Luis Gonzaga Building by Pablo Antonio; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\">Insular Life Building</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2646\">Cesar Concio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buildings became increasingly taller in the decades that followed. Until the 1950s, the height of buildings was limited to 30 m. In 1960, a Manila ordinance raised the limit to 45 m. Since 1990, buildings have risen to 140 m, or over 40 stories. The Rufino Tower, a commercial building in Makati, is 150 m high. However, architects of commercial buildings have taken cognizance of the need to be environmentally sound. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/373\">San Miguel Corporation</a> in Pasig is designed to be energy efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Marcos era, the influx of foreign capital and the privatization of government property as a means to pay the Philippines&rsquo;s foreign debt opened new areas for development. A &ldquo;global city&rdquo; was built at Fort Bonifacio, straddling Makati City and Taguig. As conceived, the global city was a planned environment of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">high-rise</a>, high-tech, and high-density buildings with commercial, residential, educational, hotel, sports, and medical facilities. Foreign designers were drawn into the making of this global city to add prestige and global marketability to the new development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other developments were undertaken in Metro Manila, such as Eastwood in Quezon City and Rockwell beside Tiendesitas in Pasig. The growth of the Business Process Outsourcing industry and backroom operations for multinational corporations catalyzed the construction of high rises open 24 hours a day for call centers. Cafes and restaurants, fast food chains, and convenience stores opened 24 hours, 7 days a week, thus creating a different rhythm for city life. The corresponding architectural effect followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More of these global cities are rising outside Metro Manila, such as those in Alabang, Rizal, and Santa Rosa, Laguna. Cities outside Manila are building their own techno hubs, such as those in Camp John Hay in Baguio City, the former site of the Lahug Airport in Cebu City, and in Liloan, north of Cebu. In Talisay, Cebu, a magnet to attract companies and families to settle in the new development is the Church of San Pedro Calungsod, hailed as the Visayan saint. In Iloilo, the site of the airport at Mandurriao, abandoned since the airport was moved to Cabatuan, is being redeveloped with the construction of a multimillion convention center. Davao is developing sites at Matina and Lanang near the Francisco Bangoy International Airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variation of the global city is the entertainment capital. Examples of these are Resorts World, in front of the Ninoy Aquino International Airport 3 (NAIA 3), and the City of Dreams, which is at the reclamation area in Para&ntilde;aque City near the SM Mall of Asia. The latter has hotels, casinos, and theme parks. These commercial entertainment areas cater to a growing metropolis and a more mobile international set that can spend a weekend in another country as it pleases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As commercial buildings rise and also get taller, the ecological impact of these new developments has raised some concerns. A new awareness of environmental responsibility has spurred the rise of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">&ldquo;green architecture.&rdquo;</a> This is architecture that saves on energy and resources such as water and fuel. It is architecture that aims to leave behind a small carbon footprint and restore the greenery and its beneficial effects, which the bulldozing of land for new development hampers and even destroys. The Philippine Green Building Council, formed in 2006, awards certifications called the Building for Ecologically Responsive Design Excellence (BERDE)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for buildings and construction firms that follow ecologically sound principles. The First Balfour Inc., a construction company, received the first BERDE certification in 2014. The United States Green Building Council also awards certifications called the Leadership for Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The Zuellig Building in Makati received the LEED Platinum Certification in 2013. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

These structures could also double up as informal schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Two types of school buildings emerged during Spanish rule: the <strong>colegio</strong> (college) or <strong>universidad</strong> (university) found in cities, and the <strong>escuela pia</strong> or <strong>escuela primaria</strong> (primary schools) found in different pueblos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Girls were taught separately from boys; boys under the tutelage of priests and brothers; girls under nuns. Within the walls of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> were the boys&rsquo; schools: the Dominican-run Universidad de Santo Tomas and Colegio de San Juan de Letran; and the Jesuit-run Colegio de Manila and Colegio de San Jose. Schools run by nuns were Colegio de Santa Rita of the Augustinian-Recollects; Colegio de Santa Isabel of the Daughters of Charity; and the Colegio de Santa Potenciana of the Franciscans. A unique primary school, established near the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, was the Escuela de Tiples. This was a residential school for the children&rsquo;s choir that sang at the ceremonies of the cathedral. Also in Intramuros were the seminaries, training ground for the clergy. The first seminary, built in 1705, was the Seminario de San Clemente, located behind the Manila Cathedral. This was abandoned in the 1750s after the seminaries of San Jose and San Carlos Borromeo were established. Outside the walled city, the Jesuits established the Colegio de San Ildefonso in Santa Cruz (Manila), the Colegio de Loreto in Cavite Puerto, the Colegio de Iloilo in Arevalo, the Colegio de San Ildefonso in Cebu, and the Colegio de Zamboanga beside <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\">Fort Pilar</a>.

Students living in such a college go to the university for their courses, although lectures might be delivered by professors and priests living in the college to augment the learning acquired in the university. Thus, the boarders of the Colegio de San Jose went to the Colegio de Manila (later Universidad de Manila) for their courses. In the absence of a university nearby, the colleges developed into boarding schools. Until the 19th century, very few Filipinos studied in the universities. More often than not, they were seminarians obtaining a bachelor or licentiate degree as a prerequisite for ordination. The student body was composed mostly of Spaniards and their children, soldiers, and religious completing their courses. Higher degrees were given for law, letters, and theology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 19th century, as more Filipinos acquired wealth, their children studied for advanced degrees. The University of Santo Tomas (UST) offered degrees in medicine and pharmacy. In 1859 the Jesuits were given charge of a school that would become the Ateneo de Manila. Starting as a primary school, it later evolved into a college with bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in arts and letters, surveying, and engineering. Not all college buildings were of durable <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">material</a>. In 1734, the Jesuit college in Zamboanga had a nipa roof and was probably of bamboo. Provincial colleges also did not have many priests assigned to them, as only two or three would compose the faculty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 1727 map of Manila indicates which of the early 18th-century school buildings were built of stone and masonry. The permanent stone buildings were generally depicted as following the atrial plan. Typical of the school buildings built during this period was the Colegio de Manila. Here a church or chapel formed one side of the atrium. In the atrium was a garden with a well. The building around the atrium housed school facilities on the lower floors and residences on the upper floor. The college was unusually tall with three stories, whereas the other colleges had two stories. In this college were found a library, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/74/1564\">printing press</a>, classrooms, a pharmacy, an herbarium, a refectory or dining hall, kitchen, storeroom, and stables. The precise location of these rooms within the building is unknown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The colleges were repaired and expanded during their long history. By the late 19th century, UST had laboratories for physics, a museum, and an extensive library in a long two-story building. This fronted the Colegio de Santa Potenciana and was separated from the neo-Gothic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">church of Santo Domingo</a> by a street and the Plaza de Santo Tomas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A feature of 19th-century Manila schools was the <strong>salon de actos</strong>, an auditorium where plays, lectures, and other school functions were held. The salon was the best appointed room in the whole structure. The UST salon had a coffered ceiling; the Ateneo had an elegant pair of stairs that led to the hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the establishment of primary schools was an integral part of colonizing strategies, the construction of numerous schoolhouses did not gain headway until the 19th century. During the 17th and 18th centuries, classes were conducted in the <strong>convento</strong> or in the house of the maestro, the male teacher whose stipend was paid by community funds. Primary schools were geared toward catechetical instruction above all. Reading and writing were taught to help children learn prayers and the teachings of the Catholic faith. The reading primer was popularly called&nbsp;<em>caton</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 19th century, primary schools had been organized under the heading of&nbsp;<em>primera&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>segunda enze&ntilde;anza</em>, roughly equivalent to present-day elementary and high schools. Girls were taught separately from boys under a maestra, or female teacher, while the boys had their own maestro; likewise, separate schoolhouses were built for girls and for boys. Where feasible, schoolhouses were built of durable material, such as stone, brick, and hardwood. These schoolhouses were generally built at the urging of the townspeople with the support of the parish priest, who sometimes took charge of construction. Schoolhouses were long and narrow one-story structures, built close to the ground, with no posts raising the floor above bare earth. The portal of the school was found at the center of the longer side of the building, decorated with engaged columns or pilasters and crowned by a pediment. The walls left and right of the portal were pierced by rectangular windows. Schoolhouses employed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> elements, such as Doric and Tuscan capitals and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Roman</a> arches. These schoolhouses were built fronting the plaza or near the church and consequently had no grounds. They were also poorly lighted, having small windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of hispanic-type schools still stand today. The one found in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte, has one story, with an entrance whose pediment is decorated with the name of Jesus. The school at Magsingal, Ilocos Sur, built in 1827, is a one-story structure, with a triangular pediment on the facade, plain pillars flanking the arched doorway, and rose windows piercing the clerestory. The escuela pia in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Taal</a>, Batangas, has semicircular steps leading to the entrance. A plain triangular pediment crowns the center of the facade, which is flanked by unadorned pilasters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the <strong>seminario</strong>, a school for those preparing for the priesthood <strong>,</strong> the <strong>casa de huerfanos</strong> was a residential institution that also held classes for its boarders. This was an orphanage for children whose parents had died or who had been abandoned. It had no distinctive architectural features that would differentiate it from the colegios and other residential schools. As in the colegios, the lower floor was dedicated to classrooms, library, offices, and public spaces, while the upper story was for living quarters. Two casas de huerfanos that have been in continuous operation since the Spanish era are the Asilo de San Vicente de Paul, established in 1885, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">Hospicio de San Jose</a>, established in 1810 in Pandacan, then transferred between 1835 and 1840 to Isla de Convalescencia, an island on the Pasig River. Both have been run by the Daughters of Charity since the late 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Asilo de Huerfanos in Malabon was established by the Augustinian friars in 1887 to house orphans of the 1882 plague. The orphanage had been housed in Mandaluyong before the transfer to Malabon, an Augustinian parish. The orphanage building, consisting of a longitudinal, two-story structure, is still standing in Malabon, although it has long been abandoned as an orphanage. The building is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) of enormous proportions. In its heyday, it had separate quarters for boys and girls. It had a library, classrooms, laboratories, shops, a sewing room for the girls, and a printing press, which included rooms for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">lithography</a> and bookbinding. In 1893, the orphanage housed at least 101 persons: 74 orphans, 11 who ran the shops, 12 paid helpers, and four friars who administered the orphanage. Damaged by fire in 1899 during the Philippine-American War, the building awaits <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the close of the Spanish era, the government had built a number of school buildings in the more important towns of the islands. In 1900, it was estimated that there were about 1,000 schools in the Philippines; 39 were located in Manila, but there were only 4,000 to 5,000 students attending school daily. These buildings were not all of stone, some being oversized nipa sheds. The Americans, when setting up the public school system, used these buildings as well as small chapels until more satisfactory structures were built. They also rented private homes and set up temporary structures, paid for by municipal funds, and used these as schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine Commission passed Act No 1801, appropriating one million dollars for school buildings. This appropriation was augmented by Act No 2029 of the Philippine Assembly of 1908, which appropriated half a million dollars, or one million pesos, to be made available over four years, to aid municipalities in the construction of reinforced-concrete schoolhouses. These were popularly known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\">Gabaldon schoolhouses</a>, after Isauro Gabaldon, the assemblyman who authored the bill. Central or Insular government was responsible for giving two pesos for every peso raised by the municipal government. The initiative for building schools rested firmly on the municipal government. A level, well-drained, square site was considered ideal. The school was to be built away from the street, its distance depending on the size of the building; the bigger the school, the farther away it was to be. Grounds were needed for playfields, gardens, walks, and lawns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a> designed 15 prototypes for elementary, intermediate, and high schools. From 10 of these, local governments chose what was most appropriate for the size of their barrio or town and their budgets. Raised one meter above the ground, the Gabaldon schoolhouses had concrete walls roofed by galvanized iron sheets. They had steep roofs and wide overhangs, and windows of wood and capiz that swung out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buildings erected for tertiary level education during the American period include the main building and dormitory of the Philippine Normal School, and the initial buildings of the University of the Philippines at the Padre Faura Campus. The latter, as typified by University Hall, were in the neoclassic style, surrounded by porticoes with ionic columns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">Construction</a> of school buildings and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">reconstruction</a> of those damaged by war continued during the Philippine Republic. The new buildings followed the early <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/254\">plans</a>&mdash;long, rectangular, one-story structures&mdash;but were different; to save on construction cost, they now hugged the ground. The classrooms had two doors to allow immediate evacuation of students in the event of a fire or earthquake. Concrete, wood, and galvanized iron were the materials used. The Marcos-type school building incorporated features of previous designs but had the advantage of being prefabricated, allowing the construction of many buildings in a short time. The schoolhouse had an iron frame bolted together. The asbestos roof kept heat under control, as a typical building came without a ceiling. The walls were of prestressed concrete, and the doorframe of iron. The open transom allowed free passage of air. Windows had wooden jalousies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some elementary schools, especially in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">urban centers</a>, are more elaborate than the quick-build type. The typical building has two to three floors. The stairway, located at one end of the building, is its distinctive feature. On the high blank wall that hides the stairs from the street, the name and emblem of the school are displayed. On the second story is a corridor. The balcony serves as an extension of the classroom. An air of lightness and transparency is created by the simple wrought-iron balustrade of the balcony and by the wooden or glass jalousies. Examples of this type are the Leodegario Victorino Elementary School in Marikina and the Aurora School in Cubao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">heritage value</a> of the American-era Gabaldon schoolhouse has been recognized by the Department of Education, which in 2002, initiated a program to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">rehabilitate and restore</a> outstanding buildings. Hence, some Gabaldon schoolhouses have been cited and declared as important cultural properties by the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, public elementary and secondary school buildings being currently erected are designed primarily to be functional. They are more oriented toward answering the need for classrooms rather than creating an aesthetic experience. However, at the tertiary level, public and private colleges and universities have opted to build &ldquo;iconic buildings,&rdquo; or buildings that make a statement about what the university is about. De La Salle-College of St. Benilde&rsquo;s design school, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2641\">Ed Calma</a>, entices because of its interlocking volumes. It rises as a behemoth along crowded Singalong St and from its heights opens to a panorama of the area, with its mixture of high-rises, low and old two-story apartments, and the flimsy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\">homes of the urban poor</a>. The distinctive mark of the Lyceum University in Cavite is the recurring motif of a wide and long arching canopy that is shaped like a laurel leaf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 2000, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2122\">Schools of Living Traditions</a> have been established all over the Philippines for the preservation of indigenous arts and crafts, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">epic chanting</a>, playing and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/38/844\">making musical instruments</a>, dancing, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2106\">mat weaving</a>, and hat making. Recipients of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2123#awards\">Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (GAMABA)</a>, or National Living Treasures, are the master teachers, who pass on their knowledge by storytelling, demonstrating the process, and other such non-formal ways. The venues are generally structures built for this purpose. These may range from simple makeshift shelters with a thatched roof held up by posts, to the more elaborate houses designed according to the indigenous architectural styles of the cultural group. In Basey, Samar, the mat-weaving school is the Sa-ob Cave, the mouth of which has an extended overhang under which the students work. The&nbsp;<em>tnalak&nbsp;</em>weaving school, called Manlilikha ng Bayan Center, in Lake Sebu, South Cotabato, was built with the monetary award that GAMABA awardee <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3527\">Lang Dulay</a> (1924-2015) received for her lifetime&rsquo;s dedication to the weaving of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2119\">tnalak textile</a>. The school is a traditional house on stilts, and about 45 ft long to accommodate the length of the weaving loom and the t&rsquo;nalak cloth. The Balay Turun-an in Calinog, Iloilo, is in the architectural style of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2358\">Karay-a</a> indigenous group. It is a bamboo house with a hip roof thickly thatched with cogon. Instead of walls, it is surrounded on all four sides by windows with crisscrossed bamboo slats that are widely spaced for ventilation. In these Schools of Living Tradition, furniture is either absent or sparse because the learning activities require much space. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>Gabaldon schoolhouses refer to the schoolhouses built by the American colonial government starting 1907 which followed one of the 10 main prototypes designed by American architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a>. These were schoolhouses for elementary and intermediate or high school students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the American period from 1900 to 1946, education was a priority of the American colonizers, and into it the colonial government poured all the resources and personnel that it could muster. American-style education had the avowed aim of producing good, upright, skilled, and educated citizenry to benefit from and to contribute to the establishment of the American type of democracy in Asia. Toward this end, the Americans established the Bureau of Education, the predecessor of the Department of Education (DepEd) of the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To work for the Bureau, American teachers called Thomasites (because the first batch arrived on the USS Thomas) were brought early in the 1900s to replace soldiers who had been teaching since 1898. English was introduced as the medium of instruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The need to provide school buildings to facilitate the education of the Filipinos became immediately evident. In 1898, there were 534 schools constructed by the Spaniards. The Americans added 1,000 more school buildings and the numbers steadily grew in the first decade. The Americans adopted three kinds of school buildings: the barrio school, the municipal school, and high school buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American Architect and Yale University graduate William Parsons was commissioned to design several prototypes for the schoolhouses. He designed 20 prototypes that ranged from the school with one classroom to one with more than 10 classrooms. Prototypes were also designed for elementary schools and high schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1907, assemblyman Isauro Gabaldon allotted a budget of one million pesos or $60,000 for the construction of these prototypes all over the Philippines. Because of his sponsorship of the prototype schools, they came to be known as Gabaldon Schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The schoolhouse prototypes ranged from 1 to 20 classrooms and depending on the budget and requirements, these were normally laid out in a straight line, L-shaped, U-shaped, or quadrilateral with a courtyard in the middle. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">materials</a> were made of wood or concrete depending on the availability of materials in the vicinity. The roof was commonly made of corrugated galvanized iron sheets on a truss system made of wood members. There were two distinctive construction systems of a Gabaldon school, one was the vertical member of truss made of round steel bars and if the walls were made of concrete, it was made of a reinforced concrete built-in wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gabaldon schoolhouses were invariably one-story structures raised above the ground by a meter or so to keep the wooden floor safely above the humid ground. The ceilings were about four meters high to allow hot air to rise. The ceiling kept heat generated by the roof from seeping downwards. A steep roof with wide overhangs, similar to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) roof, kept rain away. The windows were tall but narrow and swung outwards like the awning windows of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut). These were made of wood and <strong>capiz</strong> shells. To give the school a monumental air, the facade had a portico approached by stairs that traversed the length of the building. The more common structure had a room jutting out from each end of the facade, creating a recessed effect. The initiative for building schools rested firmly on the municipal government. A level, well-drained, square site was considered ideal. The school was to be built away from the street, its distance depending on the size of the building; the bigger the school, the farther away it was to be. Grounds were needed for playfields, gardens, walks, and lawns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were 15 typical plans. By 1911, Plans No 4, 5, 9, and 11 were abandoned since the other plans served their purposes well. Plans No 1 and 2 had one and two rooms, respectively, and were suited for barrios. Plan No 3 was for a central barrio in a town where the average school attendance was not large. Plan No 6, designed for a central barrio whose students did not exceed 200, had the advantage of having an assembly hall and could be built in parts as municipal finances allowed. Plan No 7, similar to Plan No 6, had a storeroom and office. Plan No 10 was suitable for intermediate schools and was built in large growing towns. Plan No 12 was Plan No 10 with additions and was large enough for the needs of a large provincial capital. When completed, it formed a quadrangle and had 20 classrooms. Plans No 8 and 12 were for trade schools. Provincial high schools were designed case to case. Schools varied in cost from 2,100 to 2,700 pesos for Plan No 1 types, and from 17,000 to 22,000 pesos for Plan No 10 schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High school buildings, which likewise followed a longitudinal plan, could have porticos in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance style</a>, i.e., with arches resting on columns or arches without columns. In spite of the devastations caused by World War II, many schools from the first half of the 20th century survive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2003, the Department of Education or DepEd allotted a budget for the conservation of several Gabaldon schools in order to commemorate its centennial celebration. The Gabaldon school is projected as the image of the department and an icon of the education system. Since most of the Gabaldon schools were left abandoned and deteriorating, restoring these schools would add more public school classrooms, which were needed by the educational system. The restored Gabaldon school would also be the central hub of the campus as it would house not only classrooms but also common facilities, which students could use even as they appreciate the style of the old school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DepEd issued guidelines in identifying school buildings that were to be conserved. The distinctive significance&mdash;whether architectural, historical, social, or scientific&mdash;of the Gabaldon schoolhouse marked them as deserving conservation. As one of the key buildings in a town, some schoolhouses had the added significance of being the site of historical events or being associated with a famous person. DepEd listed the following characteristics as giving significance to the schoolhouse:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1) Architectural</strong> &mdash;The buildings&rsquo; adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical</a> forms to a tropical setting makes the schoolhouse an important <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">heritage building</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) <strong>Historical</strong></strong> &mdash;The schoolhouses have historical significance because of their age. According to Republic Act No 10066, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009</a>, the schoolhouse counts as an Important Cultural Property due to its age which is more than 50 years old. The schoolhouse points to the origin of DepEd as the continuation of the American education system established in 1901. The Gabaldon buildings are the living testimony of DepEd&rsquo;s history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3) Social</strong> &mdash;The schools attest to the role of education in Philippine life. Majority of Filipinos in the American period were educated in these schoolhouses, including many outstanding Filipinos, some of whom have assumed public office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Scientific</strong> &mdash;Its more than 10 prototypes spread all over the Philippines are a significant accomplishment and a unique one for heritage buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Melvin G.

		"text": "<p>Heritage refers to the historical, social, cultural, and religious inheritance of a place or a people that may be tangible or intangible. Using the distinction made by UNESCO in the Kyoto Heritage Convention of 1972, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">National Cultural Heritage Act of 2009</a> or Republic Act (RA) No 10066, passed 27 Jul, defines <strong>tangible heritage</strong> as &ldquo;sites, places or locations, structures and objects that last through time and remain long after their original creators have passed away,&rdquo; while <strong>intangible heritage</strong> &ldquo;refers to practices, customs, belief manifested externally but need to be reenacted, repeated, renewed and passed on often through oral instruction and hands-on practice.&rdquo; Tangible heritage is thus applied to town plazas, buildings, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortifications</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a>, ancestral houses, government buildings, sites, and landscapes, as well as art works and objects of value and significance, either because they are associated with an important historical person or event, express a culture distinctly, or have artistic and aesthetic merit. Intangible heritage is applied to such things as performances of drama, music, dance, ritual, practices, local cuisine, arts, and crafts passed on from teacher to student.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Heritage Act defines <strong>heritage zones</strong> as &ldquo;historical, anthropological, archaeological, artistic geographical areas and settings that are culturally significant to the country, as declared by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> and/or the National Historical Institute.&rdquo; A heritage zone covers <strong>built and open sites</strong>, protects tangible heritage, and fosters the continued existence and survival of intangible heritage. This same law identifies the National Museum and/or the National Historical Institute, now <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2683\">National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</a>, with the cooperation of the Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board or HLURB and other agencies, as the implementing agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In its Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR), RA 10066 defines other terms related to heritage zone. <strong>Historical landmark</strong> refers to &ldquo;sites or structures associated with events or achievements significant to Philippine history as declared by NHCP.&rdquo; <strong>Historical shrines</strong> refer to &ldquo;historical sites and structures hallowed and revered for their history or association&rdquo; as declared by NHCP. In addition, two terms of popular nomenclature are <strong>heritage site</strong>, which refers to specific areas, whether built or open, or a building, and <strong>historic center</strong>, which refers to the poblacion of a municipality. In lowland areas influenced by hispanic urbanism, this corresponds to the areas around the town plaza where the church complex, civic centers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">market</a>, school, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\">town hall</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>, and principal houses are built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually found within these historical areas are the following as defined by RA 10066: <strong>Cultural property</strong> refers to &ldquo;all products of human creativity by which a people and a nation reveal their identity, including architecture and sites of human activity.&rdquo; <strong>Important cultural property</strong> refers to a cultural property having exceptional cultural, artistic, and historical significance&rdquo; as determined by the NHCP, the National Museum (NM), and the National Archives. <strong>National cultural treasure</strong> refers to a unique cultural property found locally, possessing outstanding historical, cultural, artistic, and/or scientific value which is highly significant and important to the country, and officially declared as such by the pertinent cultural agency. The NM is the agency that usually declares an object or site as a national treasure or an important cultural property. The latter designation is a step below national cultural treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>An NHCP declaration entitles the historical site or heritage zone to a marker and government protection. Likewise, all property declared by the NM as cultural heritage areas enjoy government protection. Interventions on them must be consistent with the characteristics of the declared site. Adaptive re-use or &ldquo;the utilization of buildings, other built structures, and sites of value for purposes other than that for which they were intended originally, in order to conserve the site, their engineering integrity and authenticity of design is recognized&rdquo; by the IRR. The IRR also provides for professional assistance from the government, including funding, for declared sites and properties, whether publicly or privately owned. Funding for conservation and restoration, however, is subject to availability. But the provisions of this law have proven to be beneficial, for example, in the case of the earthquake-damaged churches of Bohol and Cebu, which received assistance through the NHCP and NM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines, the NHCP has singled out a few areas as historical. In 2000, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/424\">Pila</a>, Laguna&rsquo;s town center with its church complex and 35 residences were declared a national historical landmark. In 2001, the town center of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a> was also declared a national historical landmark. Declared as the first Heritage Zone on 24 May 2011 is the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/418\">&ldquo;Old Town of Dapitan,&rdquo;</a> marked as &ldquo;Ang Lumang Bayan ng Dapitan&rdquo; in celebration of the 150th birth anniversary of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Dr. Jos&eacute; Rizal</a>, who lived in Dapitan from 1892 to 1896. In 2014, a portion of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/420\">Iloilo</a>&rsquo;s central business district was declared as a historic center with the title &ldquo;Distritong Pangkomersyong Lungsod ng Iloilo Bilang Pook Pamana.&rdquo; The zone includes the area of the former Calle Real and clusters around the Iloilo Central Market. Also in 2014, a portion of Santa Ana in Manila was declared heritage zone by the NHCP. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>&rsquo;s heritage zone, which includes the cathedral, bishop&rsquo;s palace, the Burgos house, and the many <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) of the former parian, stands unique because in 1992, it was listed in UNESCO&rsquo;s World Heritage List.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither the NHCP nor the UNESCO&rsquo;s list is exhaustive, though they indicate those sites that have passed their respective criteria. These often need thorough and adequate documentation, a local body organized to protect and conserve the heritage site, and a plan of action for conservation and protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although not officially declared as such, the following are also recognized as heritage zones: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>, University Belt, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Taft Ave Corridor</a>, and San Juan in Metro Manila (NCR); and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a> city center, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/428\">Tayabas</a> poblacion, Romblon poblacion, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/425\">Silay</a> City center, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a> poblacion and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/416\">Carcar</a> center, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/422\">Loay</a> poblacion, Romblon poblacion, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/430\">Zamboanga City</a> center in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the historic capital of the Philippines, Manila encapsulates the country&rsquo;s architectural and built heritage. The walled city of Intramuros, the heart of Manila&rsquo;s heritage zone, stands out. Although damaged during World War II, Intramuros has been partially restored, and its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">walls</a> still speak of the Spanish legacy. Across the Pasig and north of Intramuros are two business districts: Binondo, which represents the Spanish era, and Escolta, which represents the American. But representing the American years best is the Taft Avenue Corridor, enclosed by three parallel roads that run north to south: Roxas Blvd (formerly Dewey), Taft Ave, and San Marcelino. Bounded north by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Central Post Office</a> on the banks of the Pasig and Rizal Memorial Stadium on Pablo Ocampo St (formerly Vito Cruz), this zone contains public and private buildings associated with the American colonial era. In this zone are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a>, the Finance and Agriculture Buildings (now all part of the National Museum complex), the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, the Philippine General Hospital, and the University of the Philippines. Along Roxas Blvd are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2284\">Rizal Shrine</a>, Elks Club, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army-Navy Club</a>, American Embassy which used to be the residence of the American Commissioner, and other hotels. Scattered in the area are churches, schools like St. Paul&rsquo;s and De La Salle, residences, and business establishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The University Belt along C.M. Recto Ave (formerly Azcarraga) and Espa&ntilde;a is so named because of the many schools clustered in the area. The City of Manila and NHCP declared Santa Ana, along Pedro Gil and around the church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Desamparados, a heritage zone. San Juan&rsquo;s heritage zone is along N. Domingo and P. Guevarra Sts. On the elevated portion of P. Guevarra known as Little Baguio are grand houses, a few even from the American era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baguio is the direct result of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burham</a>&rsquo;s plan for a summer retreat on a hill station for the American civil government and bureucracy. The heritage areas here include the city center around Burnham Park, northward to Teachers&rsquo; Camp, Mansion House, Camp John Hay and Baguio Country Club, and the surrounding hills Aurora, Dominican, and Mirador.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Malolos heritage district is composed of the Barasoain district, which includes the Barasoain Church and <strong>convento</strong>, several bahay na bato on Paseo del Congreso, and the restored <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a> (royal house); and across the bridge, the older poblacion dominated by the Malolos Cathedral, convento, and plaza, including the ancestral houses around the church and plaza, especially in the&nbsp;<em>pariancillo&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>kamestisuhan&nbsp;</em>barrio right next to the church where most of the Women of Malolos lived and where most of the offices of the Malolos Republic were housed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tayabas is the old capital of Quezon Province. The heritage zone is in the town center, with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/388\">church of San Miguel</a> and the casa real. At the boundaries of the town are the Spanish colonial cemetery, with its chapel and bridges from the same era that connect the capital to the rest of the province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Silay has not been officially declared by the NHCP as a heritage zone, a number of structures have been marked by the agency. The city itself has marked other ancestral houses and historic structures, thereby virtually declaring Silay&rsquo;s center as a heritage zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the NHCP has declared the central business district of Iloilo a heritage zone, the zone may actually be expanded south to include Plaza Libertad, Gen. Hughes St until Fort San Pedro, which has been demolished. This zone is the site of historic church of San Jose, the Elizalde and Ker houses, Colegio de Sagrado Corazon, the Casino Espa&ntilde;ol, the English Club, and theaters such as Prince. Northward, the zone may include &ldquo;millionaires row,&rdquo; which is along the road that connects Iloilo with Jaro and Zarraga. Molo up to Arevalo Sts along the highway could be considered as a heritage zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cebu&rsquo;s heritage zone is defined by the areas around <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/301\">Fort San Pedro</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Basilica Minore of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/286\">Cathedral</a>, the Parian and Tinago districts, and the southern end of Colon St. Structures built here are from the Spanish and American colonial eras. The Cebu City Hall, the Maritima building, and the Gotiaco Building are from the American era. Another heritage zone is midtown and uptown Cebu where the Fuente Osme&ntilde;a, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/273\">Bradford Memorial Church</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/285\">Cebu Provincial Capitol</a>&mdash;all from the American era&mdash;are located. The town of Carcar has two foci: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/280\">Santa Catalina church</a> and its immediate environs, and the lower town linked by a road system that connects to the National Highway. Loay&rsquo;s heritage zone is on the hill where the church is located and at the foot of the hill where there are ancestral houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Romblon poblacion are possible heritage zones. Romblon&rsquo;s heritage zone is defined by the pier, plaza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/366\">church</a> complex, city hall, provincial capitol, and hills that flank the poblacion where the fortifications are located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zamboanga&rsquo;s heritage zone is defined by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\">Fort Pilar</a>, which represents the Spanish era, and the Zamboanga City Hall, which represents the American era. Within this area are found the residence of Gen &ldquo;Blackjack&rdquo; Pershing who was appointed military governor of Moro Province and the park named after him. Pettit Barracks, the Ateneo de Zamboanga, and the Knights of Columbus are also found in this zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heritage zones define a city or town. They contribute to the sense of history and continuity of a place, give it an identity, and foster neighborliness instead of individualism and separation.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

These are found among the seafaring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> (Badjao). As of the 1930s, the Badjao had three types of boats: the fast sailing <strong>vinta</strong>, the fishing <strong>lipa</strong>/<strong>lepa</strong>, and the <strong>sapit</strong>. The latter two may be considered houseboats. The lipa, a longer and slower boat than the vinta, had no outriggers and was used as a residence. The houseboat, which never left the anchorage, was 12-15 m long and 1.80 m wide, and had a <strong>palaw</strong> (house) mounted on it, which made it top-heavy and cumbersome for maneuvering on the open sea. However, the palaw of both the lipa and the <strong>djenging</strong> can be dismantled so that the boats can be used for fishing or speedy travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sama Dilaut of Tungkalang have three types of boats: the lepa; the djenging; and the <strong>dapang</strong>. The houseboats are the lepa and djenging, whereas the dapang is used for fishing and long trips. The boats are dugouts or made of <strong>casco</strong> (timber or log) that are hollowed out. Of the three boats, the lepa is without outriggers. From end to end, or bow to stern, its hull is about 11 m. Its palaw consists of a long pole with a <strong>sapaw</strong> (nipa roof) slung over it. An adult cannot stand straight inside the palaw, which is only a meter high.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The djenging is considered by the Sama Dilaut to be their oldest type of houseboat, which they trace back to their ancestors. The hull of this boat is 15 m long and 2 m wide, on the average. Its palaw has four <strong>dingding </strong> (walls), windows, doors, and a galvanized iron roof. The walls may be of either wood or thatched coconut palm leaves. The cooking area is at the bow, which is the front part of the boat; one enters the palaw through the stern. It is simply furnished: a sail, a lamp for fishing, a water jar, a stove, several pots, plates, poles, a&nbsp;<em>baul&nbsp;</em>(chest), perhaps a suitcase, pillows and mats, and above the roof, fishing gear held by two poles with forked ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sama Dilaut&rsquo;s home is also a place of worship; they have no special structures designated as such. Thus, the palaw&rsquo;s interiors may also include the <strong>hainan</strong>, a bar 1.5 meters long that represents the ancestral spirits. It is carved in the <strong>ukkil</strong>/<strong>okir/okil</strong> style, which consists of lines, curves, and geometric shapes painted in the traditional Sama Dilaut colors of green, red, yellow, blue, and white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The largest houseboat, no longer being built, was the <strong>balutu</strong> or <strong>kubu</strong>, which was the residence of a wealthy&nbsp;<em>panglima&nbsp;</em>(community leader). The house was 10 m long and 3 to 4 m wide; thus, it was the most spacious of the houseboats. Running along the top of the front and back walls of its house were panels with the <strong>lauwa-lauwa</strong> (cobwebs), which were very finely carved designs. This was similar to the <strong>calado</strong> in the Spanish-period <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (stone house) owned by the Christianized elite.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional Sama Dilaut houseboat is a sculptural and visual work of art. Up to the 1960s, individual master boat builders were known by name and highly respected for their artistic genius. First, with the use of his <strong>patuk</strong> (tools), the <strong>tukang</strong> (boat builder) works upon the natural shape of the casco that will become the <strong>baran</strong> (keel). This determines the boat&rsquo;s basic structure. The hull of the boat is a layer of planks that are laid on the hollowed-out log. Each plank must be deliberately bent to fit the shape of the keel. The plank is balanced on a pile of rocks like a seesaw so that each end can be bent down by weights. The <strong>katig</strong> (bamboo outriggers) are bent in the same way so that the ends will rise slightly from the surface of the water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wooden ornaments carved with ukkil designs are attached to the <strong>jung-ar</strong> (prow). The most eye-catching of these is the <strong>sa-am</strong>, an elaborately carved and brightly colored wing-like extension jutting from the bow. Designs for the sa-am are the dragon, the <strong>sarimanok</strong>, and the <strong>buaya</strong>, which imitates a crocodile&rsquo;s gaping mouth. The <strong>ling-ai-at</strong> is a strip of decorative carving placed underneath the jung-ar. Additionally, a bar in the ukkil design stretches along the whole length of the boat itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Related to the houseboat is the <strong>casco</strong>, a flat-bottomed boat used for transporting goods at a short distance. Popular from the 19th to the early years of the 20th century, the casco in Manila and its environs also had provisions for living. Toward the rear of the casco, an area covered with sawali matting was used for sleeping and eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the flooded plains along the banks of the Agusan River are the floating houses of Bunawan, Agusan del Sur. These residences, built by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, are placed on top of a raft of timbers. The raft rises or sinks with the overflow of the river. Unlike boats, these houses do not travel but are tied to piles, trees, or stone anchors.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>&ldquo;Indigenous house&rdquo; refers to domestic architecture among the ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines, and includes the lowland houses called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut), as well as the dwellings found among the cultural communities in the Philippines and known by various names. They can be as elaborate as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> <strong>torogan</strong> (datu&rsquo;s large house) or as simple as the <strong>dait-dait</strong>, the windscreen of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a>. These houses are created in the typical Southeast Asian fashion with no architects, guided only by traditional wisdom and a humanistic vision of the house as a setting for relationships with other human beings and with nature. The indigenous house shares common features with the rest of Southeast Asian indigenous architecture, namely, piles or posts to elevate the floor of the house, and the gable or hip roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether built on a hill, mountain, plain, river, or sea, these structures are fashioned out of the bounties of the earth&mdash;wood, vegetation, sometimes mud. Bamboo is the favorite material, as in most of Southeast Asia. It is used for posts, flooring, siding, roofing, and many other purposes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">Materials</a> may include coconut wood and leaves;&nbsp;<em>bakawan&nbsp;</em>or mangrove; hardwoods such as narra, pine, and molave; stones; cogon grass, nipa, and banana bark for roof coverings and wall sidings; and rattan and other vines for fastening.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Most indigenous houses conform to a general pattern: they have steep thatched roofs to keep out the rain; they are elevated on posts or stilts, the answer to floods and the dampness and humidity of the earth; and they have slatted flooring, which allows the cool air from below to enter the house. In the lowlands, they use bamboo, nipa, and cogon to help keep out the heat; and in the uplands, tightly fitting solid planks to help keep out the cold. In the absence of walls or partitions within the house, the use of different levels, even mats or a fireplace in a corner, can differentiate one section from another. This generally results in a multipurpose one-room structure, which is light and airy, comfortable and functional, yet durable and structurally stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decoration of the house is often a good fusion of aesthetics and social, political, and religious realities. Pig skulls or carabao horns may adorn a house mainly for social prestige. Among the Maranao, the colorful <strong>panolong</strong> (decorative beam-ends) of houses indicate one&rsquo;s social position.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Culture dictates a set of beliefs and assumptions decidedly indigenous that govern the choice of site, time, and season for building; rituals to be observed before and during the construction of the house, including the reading of signs or omens that may affect the progress of the work; orientation of the house as well as the distribution of interior parts; and such other beliefs and practices that assure good health and a prosperous, happy family life, as well as protection from evil spirits for both occupants and builders.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Rituals and celebrations are a way of life for the indigenous peoples, and for these occasions the house doubles as a social and a cultural center. Ritual platforms are then built near the house or attached to it; otherwise, different parts of the house, such as the porch, or the whole house itself can be transformed into the setting for these rituals or ceremonies by simply moving or altering some parts to allow for more space and create a more appropriate setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With such frequency of rituals and life-cycle celebrations, a strong sense of community and indigenous identity inevitably emerges. People work together, build houses together, do things together in a spirit of harmony and togetherness. In such a culture that permits and encourages maximum interaction of people, communication is largely indirect, intimate, accomplished through suggestions, hints, gestures, and symbols, where each message may be decoded with ease and fluency by the members of that culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Territorial spaces are not marked by fences or walls, but merely suggested by certain symbols which are, however, accorded a certain degree of respect by the other residents in the area and by passersby. The following are avoided: littering within another&rsquo;s space; allowing cows or carabaos to stray into a neighbor&rsquo;s area; and passing too near a neighbor&rsquo;s window where someone may be sleeping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While privacy is generally observed within the understood limits of each area within and without the house, the plot of land or the designated zone at sea or along the shoreline where the houses are built remains communal property. Thus, the responsibility of maintaining the surroundings&mdash;e.g., the hill where the cluster of houses stands&mdash;rests on all the residents in the area. Common areas give the children a wider and bigger area for play, and adults more opportunities for socializing, with the increased number of possible conversation sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may be surmised that the earliest architectural improvisations bear the same pattern as present-day indigenous houses, and that the basic features of lowland dwellings, the bahay kubo of the Christian indigenous populace, had already been established even before Spanish contact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous dwellings developed with changing life styles and modes of sustenance: the lean-to evolving from the highly nomadic life of hunters and food gatherers such as the Aeta; the bamboo or wooden, one-room houses emanating from the more settled life of dry- and wet-rice cultivators such as the Cordillera groups; and the elevated house standing in water for seafaring groups in the south such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> of Sulu, and fishing communities along the coast across the Philippine archipelago. During times of intercommunity strife, when the warriors&rsquo; culture prevailed, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/248\">tree houses</a> were built by several indigenous groups, such as the Samarnon of eastern Visayas; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a> of northern Luzon, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> peoples of Mindanao. In Batanes, sturdy, stone dwellings with thick grass roofs have withstood frequent typhoons. Other house types that evolved in response to various conditions are the longhouse for community dwelling among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a> of Mindoro; the twin houses of the Itawit of Cagayan Valley; and the multi-level house of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanua</a> of Palawan and the Manobo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous concepts of building would persist well into the succeeding periods. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial period</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\"><strong>tsalet</strong></a> (chalet) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American colonial period</a>, and even the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\"><strong>barong-barong</strong></a> of the contemporary period, the prototypal indigenous house is recognized despite changes in material, scale, plan, and elevation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The indigenous house has also provided motifs and elements for modern houses and buildings. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2674\">Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa</a>&rsquo;s design for Pearl Farm on Samal Island is inspired by the Sama&rsquo;s houses on stilts. The ridge beam of the Tausug houses have inspired carved ridge beams in diverse projects such as municipal halls, hotels, and restaurants. The indigenous house remains a rich source of ideas for architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The indigenous house is a structure that copes with the specific conditions of Philippine geography, climate, and environment. It is also the embodiment of indigenous values relating to family, clan, community, and class. As a structure that expresses the unity of the people, nature and society, the indigenous house embodies some of the best characteristics of architecture that can be called Filipino.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>kamalig</strong>, also known as <strong>kamarin</strong> (from Spanish&nbsp;<em>camarin</em>, &ldquo;cabin&rdquo;), <strong>alan</strong>, <strong>alang</strong>, <strong>bangan</strong>, <strong>baysa</strong>, <strong>falig</strong>, <strong>tambubong</strong>, and <strong>tangkil</strong>, is a granary&mdash;i.e., a storehouse for grain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The storage of rice and corn, which is harvested once to three times a year, is an important preoccupation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">farming communities</a>. Therefore, the granary is their most important economic structure. This is indicated by the history of place names in certain regions of the Philippines. Tambobong is the old name of Malabon, Manila. Camalig, which is the original name of Albay, is said to derive from a shed-shaped hill next to the town. The town gave its name to the province of which it was a part until 1847, when the new province of Albay was established.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The meticulous construction of the granary produces distinctive and striking structures such as those in the Cordilleras. The alang of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> and alan of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a> are smaller replicas of the <strong>bale</strong>/<strong>fale</strong> (house), which are of wood and cogon. These are built on posts with <strong>lidi</strong>/<strong>liphon</strong>/<strong>libong</strong> (rat guards) that can take the form of disks, knobs, or cylinders. The Ifugao alang has wooden walls called <strong>gaob</strong> in Kiangan/Hungduan. The Isneg alan has walls of <strong>sawali</strong> (woven bamboo strips) that flare outwards, thus giving it the shape of a large basket. On the other hand, the <strong>falig</strong> (granary) of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a> is built at the center of their <strong>fayu</strong> (house). It is raised above the living quarters on the ground floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside these granaries are the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">bulol</a>,&nbsp;</em>a representation of the Cordillera rice god, and the&nbsp;<em>pun-amhan</em>, or the ritual box. Under the alang, the&nbsp;<em>mumbaki&nbsp;</em>(priest) performs the&nbsp;<em>baki-hongan di page</em>, which is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> for the agricultural cycle. Offerings of animals are made as the mumbaki chants and prays to the Ifugao gods and ancestors for a bountiful harvest.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In lowland communities, the <strong>silong</strong> or space beneath the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut) can be a place for storing grain. However, the more common practice is to store grain in the kamalig/kamarin, which is a separate building. The term &ldquo;kamalig&rdquo; remained in use during the Spanish colonial period despite adaptations made by the people to changing circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two common methods of storing rice appeared during the Spanish period. The more common was to keep sacks of rice in the <strong>zaguan</strong> or lower floor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). These were piled up side by side with carriages as well as equipment and supplies needed by the household. Big landlords, who took a share of their tenants&rsquo; harvest, kept rice in large stone buildings, also called &ldquo;kamalig&rdquo; or &ldquo;camarin.&rdquo; The term <strong>almacen</strong> was also used, but this term could also refer to stores for buying and selling. The kamalig consisted of a thick wall of stone and mortar in which small openings were made; hence the interior was almost always dark. A single entrance with a sturdy door was usually cut into the center of the long side of the kamalig. The building could have a roof of nipa, tile, or galvanized iron. Tile was the common roofing material because it kept the interior cool. The interior was a large space in keeping with its function of storage. Many kamalig still stand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the sugar plantations of Negros Occidental, Spanish-period 19th-century kamarin are intact, though few remain in use as storage buildings. Originally these were for storing equipment, tools, and machine spare parts, such as those of the hydraulic or the carabao-drawn sugar mills. These were also spacious enough to function as evacuation sites for the plantation workers and their families during typhoons and floods. When sugar centrals took over the milling process with 20th-century technology, the kamarin were abandoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A kamalig in Laoag, Ilocos Norte, once the storehouse of tobacco for the government company Tabacalera, is now the Ilocos Norte Museum. An ethnographic museum, it is called Gameng&mdash;a word meaning treasure. The structure resembles a church because of its pitched roof and longitudinal plan. A ruined kamalig standing near the Marikina Church has fluted pilasters in the upper story. It has been restored and is used as the Shoe Museum of Marikina, which highlights the town&rsquo;s best known product.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As modern methods of drying and storing rice developed, so did the structures for storage. The national government, through the Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s National Food Authority (NFA), built warehouses for storing bought grain. These large, long buildings have steel frames and galvanized iron sheets. The entrance is at the center of the long side. Provisions have been made so that delivery trucks can come in and out of the building with ease. Rice traders build smaller versions of the NFA-type warehouse. Structures using galvanized iron sheets for walls and roofing over a metal or wooden frame are common.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>In the Philippines, the <strong>kapitolyo</strong> or <strong>capitol</strong>, from the Latin word&nbsp;<em>capitolium</em>, has always referred to the building of the provincial government, located in the capital town or city. The kapitolyo houses the three branches of the provincial government: the executive, which includes the office of the Governor; the legislative, including the offices and meeting room of the Provincial Board; and the judicial or the court. The term has never been applied to the national legislature in Manila, which has been called the National Assembly or later on, Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term capitol originally referred to the Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill in Rome and was later applied to city halls of the Roman empire. In the United States, the Capitol is the building in Washington, DC that houses Congress. The kapitolyo was introduced during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American period</a>. During the Spanish regime, although a town was designated the capital of the province, there was no specific type of building for the provincial government.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Following norms set down by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a>, consulting architect of the Philippine government from 1905 to 1914, the kapitolyo was located in a park, away from the center of the old town, in a place that was dignified and restful. Thus, kapitolyo are found in spacious grounds or at the end of a broad boulevard, or when possible, on a bayshore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire building or its main portion was rectangular in plan, two to three stories in height, and set on a podium consisting of several steps. A two-story portico at the center of the facade sheltered the entrance which had one or several doors. In some instances, one-story buildings flanked the main body of the building. The spacious rooms had high ceilings and large windows and were arranged along broad corridors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most kapitolyo were in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassic</a> or Greek-revival style, characterized by the use of columns, entablatures, and pediments. Their architecture was influenced by the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Paris, which championed neoclassicism and had influenced architectural schools in the US where the early 20th-century Filipino architects were trained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the notable kapitolyo in the neoclassic style are those of Batangas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a>; the one in Laguna built in 1912; the Sorsogon Capitol built in 1916; the Pangasinan Capitol built in 1918; the Negros Occidental Capitol in Bacolod, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a> and completed in 1933; and the Leyte Capitol designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2702\">Antonio Toledo</a>. Some kapitolyo, such as those of Bulacan in Malolos and Tayabas (now Quezon) in Lucena, departed from the neoclassic style and tended toward the modern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1970s, new capitols have been built either to replace older ones or to construct new ones for recently organized provinces. When Pasig became a chartered city, Rizal moved its capitol to Taytay, where a neoclassical capitol with Grecian temple facade and a dome were built. Saranggani, in Mindanao, has a capitol also in the neoclassical style. That of Sulu province in Jolo is inspired by the shape and motifs of Islamic architecture, like the dome and the geometrically decorated entrance reminiscent of the <strong>iwan</strong>. When the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao was created, a central building was constructed, with a roof quoting vernacular and regional architecture characterized by projecting roof beams.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>kuta</strong>, also known as <strong>muog</strong> and <strong>tanggulan</strong> (from the Tagalog&nbsp;<em>tanggol</em>, meaning &ldquo;defend,&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>an</em>, a suffix to denote place), and later as <strong>fuerza</strong>, <strong>fortaleza</strong>, <strong>trinchera</strong>, and <strong>baluarte</strong>, is a fortification&mdash;that is, a structure built to protect the lives and property of a community against enemies. Fortifications are often built in strategic locations where protection is provided by such natural barriers as waters, swamps, cliffs, hills, mountains, and narrow passes. High grounds, which function as natural fortifications are called <strong>ili</strong> or <strong>ilihan</strong> in Visayan. Ilihan Hill in Dapitan is an example of such a fortification. In Ilocano, ili can mean village or one&rsquo;s native place. It is not unusual for these high grounds to be inhabited over time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous fortifications use stakes driven into the ground, earthwork, and stones piled on top of each other to improve the natural defense of a site. Cordillera communities locate their villages in areas which can be easily defended. Entrances to villages may be protected by low stone walls. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2353\">Ivatan</a> fortify elevated places accessible only through narrow paths. Rocks are stockpiled in the <strong>idjang</strong>, the places of refuge, in case of enemy attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Islamic communities call fortifications kuta, &ldquo;whether constructed of stone or earth&rdquo; (Majul 1961). In its broadest sense, kuta refers to any fortified position, so that even well-protected residential compounds may be regarded as examples of kuta. In 1609, Antonio Morga reported that indigenous fortifications consisted of putting up &ldquo;walls of palm trees and stout&nbsp;<em>arigue&nbsp;</em>(wooden posts) filled with earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2107\">Lantaka</a>&nbsp;</em>(native cannons) were mounted at strategic points on these walls. Houses were usually located inside the fort to insure the safety of the inhabitants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although forts were built in non-Muslim communities, notably in Pampanga and the riverine settlements along the Pasig, the best kuta were found in Muslim communities. So effective were they that they repelled advancing Spanish and American troops. The best known Muslim kuta during the Spanish period were Raja Sulayman&rsquo;s in Manila, perhaps one of the earliest Muslim kuta, which had a palisade of palm-tree logs surmounting a narrow mound and from which medium-sized artillery were mounted; Sultan Kudarat&rsquo;s in Ilihan heights close to his capital in Lamitan in Cotabato, its name derived from kuta and&nbsp;<em>bato&nbsp;</em>(stone), and having trenches around designed by the Dutch; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a> and Buayan string of kuta, which featured long-range cannons of Portuguese and Dutch manufacture, and were built on hills, swamps, and plains along the Pulangi River; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> kuta in Lanao, which vexed the Spaniards greatly; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> kuta in Sipak, Balangingi, Sungap, and Bukotingul, the most formidable being the Sipak kuta which had 5.4-6 meter-high walls of thick tree trunks filled with coral, rock, soil, and earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sulu kuta of Raja Bongsu, located on a hill close to Jolo on one of the slopes of Bud Tumantangis, had a system of interlocking trenches and walls of stout tree trunks, and had an ordinance of native lantaka and Spanish cannons. The fort, considered impregnable, resisted several assaults by Spaniards. It fell only when an outbreak of cholera, dysentery, and smallpox forced the occupants to surrender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other forms of indigenous fortification are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/248\">tree house</a> and the strong house made of hardwood called muog in Tagalog. Around 1672, Ignacio Alzina provided an illustration of the Visayan tree house, which one approached using a retractable ladder or a rope or vine. He explained in his <strong><em>Historia de las Islas e Indios de Visayas</em></strong> (History of the Islands of the Natives of Visayas) that the ladder was used to bring women and children safely to the tree house, while the rope or vine was used by men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American period</a>, the kuta, such as the Sahipa kuta on the western slope of Bud Sinuman in Sulu, continued to be built. However, such archaic fortifications proved inutile under attacks by heavy American artillery, which knocked them down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spain introduced the European system of fortification, which may be categorized into field and permanent fortification. Field fortification was used during battle and was usually a reinforced trench or an embankment of stone and gravel, supported by a palisade. Permanent fortification used stone and mortar. The best fuerza or fortaleza was made of thick walls of masonry. Forts of lower grade were the <strong>estacada </strong> (palisade) made of stout tree trunks stuck to the ground to form a wall, and the <strong>terraplen</strong> (earthwork).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first permanent fortification built by the Spaniards was a circular roofed tower on the southern side of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, facing the hermitage of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia after which the tower was named. It was designed by the Jesuit <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a> and built ca 1587 during the governorship of Santiago de Vera. Criticized in 1595 as medieval, the tower was incorporated into Bastion San Diego, a corner of the defensive system that Gov-Gen Perez de Dasmari&ntilde;as built around Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intramuros was considered the premier fortification built by the Crown. It underwent a number of renovations to improve its defensive capability, especially after the British successfully occupied Manila from 1762 to 1764. Other major defenses include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/300\">Fuerza de San Felipe</a> in Cavite, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/301\">Fuerza de San Pedro</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a> which was built ca 1600, Fuerza de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/420\">Iloilo</a> built in 1617, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\">Fuerza de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/430\">Zamboanga</a>, built in 1635 under the name San Jos&eacute;, demolished in 1663, then rebuilt in 1719.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>rThese forts were constructed following the most advanced system of fortification. The forts were laid out as polygons&mdash;Intramuros, a pentagon of unequal sides; San Pedro in Cebu, a triangle; and Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar, a quadrilateral. Thick <strong>cortina</strong> (connecting walls), about 3-10 m, connected protruding <strong>baluarte</strong> (bulwarks) built at every corner of the polygon. Soldiers stationed on these bulwarks had a good view of the connecting walls and could easily ward off attackers seeking to ram the gate or breach or scale the walls. The walls could be vaulted structures providing space within for shelter and storage. Around the 18th century, <strong>parapeto</strong> (parapets), an innovation in military architecture, were added to the walls and bulwarks. The walls could have a <strong>casamata</strong> (platform) on which were mounted the artillery that guarded the <strong>foso</strong> (moat), and a <strong>garita</strong> (guardhouse of wood or masonry) to protect sentinels from heavy rain. The moat, a deep and wide ditch surrounding the fort, was usually filled with water. The moat was fortified with masonry: the inner wall, nearer the fortification, was called <strong>escarpa</strong>; the outer wall was called <strong>contraescarpa</strong>; and its depths, <strong>fondo</strong>. A <strong>falsabraga</strong> (low wall), called <strong>barbacana</strong> in ancient times, was built in between the moat and the walls to serve as protection for the higher and principal wall. Sometimes a <strong>contrafoso</strong> (second moat) was dug to improve defenses. Another feature of fortifications of this era was the <strong>revellin</strong> or <strong>rebellin</strong>, polygonal in plan, like the bulwark, and built in front of the <strong>puerta</strong> (entrance) of the fortification to delay direct attack. Open on the side facing the principal wall, the revellin was linked to the gate by a covered road. If the fort had a moat, part of this road had a drawbridge. Provisions for water, living quarters, ammunition, and military offices were found in the fort. A chapel occupied a secure area within. Soldiers usually prayed before a battle, and a military chaplain was on hand to hear their confession and bless them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To protect the Christianized communities from marauding pirates, slave raiders from the south, and foreign invaders, and also to protect the path of the galleon, the economic lifeblood of the colony, a complex system of fortifications began to be erected as early as the 1630s in towns along the galleon route and the route of pirates. The town church itself, if made of stone or brick, was the most important defensive structure. Beside the church, the tall bell tower served as a lookout, and the tolling of its bells signaled the approach of enemies. To augment the church&rsquo;s defensive capabilities, walls were built to its side or surrounding it. The corners of these walls sometimes had bulwarks on which artillery was mounted. Outstanding examples of walled churches are found in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Baclayon</a>, Bohol; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/271\">Boac</a>, Marinduque; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/290\">Cuyo</a>, Palawan. Small freestanding forts were called <strong>fortin</strong>, an outstanding example of which is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/297\">Castillo de San Vicente Ferrer</a> at Punta Cruz, Maribojoc, Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The baluarte and <strong>castillo</strong> were two other defensive structures built at strategic places according to plan. Located on a hilltop, the baluarte was a fortified structure with slit trenches, blockhouses of stone, and a palisade of wooden logs or palm trunks with an embankment. In it was the residence of the <strong>castellan</strong>, the officer in charge of the fort, and sometimes a parade ground. Building the baluarte took more than three months. The castillo was less costly to build. If not built of stone, it was a structure with four sturdy posts, an elevated platform, and a roof resembling an oversized dovecote. The baluarte and castillo were not impregnable. In fact without ammunition, these were reduced to vulnerable structures of stone or wood. Other defensive systems were devised including the planting of pandan thickets and the scattering of star thistles along the enemy&rsquo;s path.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Signal systems were devised to warn the populace of an impending attack. Sentinels posted on the baluarte or castillo struck a hollowed tree trunk or wooden gong like the&nbsp;<em>balalong</em>,&nbsp;<em>batong</em>, and&nbsp;<em>tatolong</em>, or blew a horn, which could be a big shell called&nbsp;<em>bodyong&nbsp;</em>in the Visayas, or a handcrafted carabao horn called&nbsp;<em>tambuli&nbsp;</em>in Tagalog. The ringing of church bells was the most common signal. Flags, baskets hoisted on poles, bonfires, candles, torches, the firing of three cannon shots, and even fireworks were also used to signal impending attack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Delgado, writing in 1754, listed other forts in the country:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Luzon-Palawan area were Fort of Playa Honda in Pangasinan; Fort of Mamamalas in Lubao, Pampanga; Fort San Francisco in Nueva Segovia, Lal-lo, Cagayan; Fort San Jose Cavicunga, Fort San Jose Capinatan, Fort Santiago, and the forts of Tuao and Cabagan in Cagayan Valley; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/302\">Fort of Taytay</a> in Palawan; and Forts of Cuyo, La Lutaya, Linapacan, and Culion in the Calamianes Island group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Visayas were Fort of Capiz, Panay Island, which was a palisade; Fort of Romblon Island; Forts of Carigara and Palo, Leyte; Forts of Baclayon and Dauis, Bohol; and the forts of Palapag, Lauang, Catbalogan, and Guiuan in Samar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Mindanao, there were Forts Santiago and San Francisco in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte; Fort of Iligan in Lanao del Norte; Fort San Jose in Cagayan de Oro, Misamis Oriental; Forts of Linao in Agusan; and the forts of Tandag and Cateel, Davao Oriental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fr San Antonio added the following to Delgado&rsquo;s list: Fort Santiago Itugud and Fort Cabaga in Cagayan Valley. Besides these, Fort Nuestra Senora de Triunfo was built in Ozamis during the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Delgado&rsquo;s and San Antonio&rsquo;s lists are incomplete, though. In the later part of the 19th century, forts were built in Jolo, Sulu; Lamitan, Basilan; and Bongao, Tawi-Tawi. Taken together they formed a defense network. A survey of colonial fortifications completed for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a> in 2008 documented more than 350 structures consisting of permanent forts, watchtowers, small forts or fort&iacute;n, gun emplacement points, fortified towns, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the fortifications that dotted the Philippines were built at the initiative of the townsfolk under their parish priest. The Franciscans in Albay, the Recollects in Mindanao, Palawan, and Mindoro, the Jesuits in Bohol and Mindanao, and even the secular priests in Antique built many fortifications with government approval. As ammunition and artillery were modernized, the thick connecting walls that characterized fuerzas built during the 17th and 18th centuries were replaced by thinner walls with more provisions for rifles. A government-built 19th-century fort is at Pikit, Cotabato toward the direction of the headwaters of the Pulangi River. It was built on a hill to forestall any Maguindanao attack on the Christian settlements downstream. With the coming of the Americans and more sophisticated weapons like the Winchester repeating rifles, the Spanish fort became obsolete. Although soldiers did take refuge behind these old walls, dug trenches, and set up palisades and sandbag walls during the Philippine-American War and World War II, the fort of masonry was no longer built. Forts like McKinley, later renamed Bonifacio, were tracts of land surrounded by wire fences. This was also the case for Camp Keithley in Lanao and Fort Stotsenberg (later renamed Clark Field) in Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of these fortifications have found a new use that has proven to be popular. A number have been turned to parks and venues for events. Examples are the Fort San Pedro in Cebu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/302\">Fort Isabel</a> in Taytay, Palawan, and Fort del Pilar in Zamboanga.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>kuweba</strong> (from Spanish&nbsp;<em>cueva&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;cave,&rdquo;), also known as <strong>yungib</strong>, <strong>kweba</strong>, <strong>liyang</strong>, <strong>langub</strong>, <strong>butas</strong>, <strong>lagusan</strong>, <strong>lungga</strong>, may also be an overhang or a rock shelter. It is a term associated with ancient habitation, enchantment, mystery, the supernatural, worship, ritual, burial, and treasure. Since the appearance of modern man on the planet about 200,000 years ago, caves have been a very essential means of man&rsquo;s survival. Prehistoric humans used caves as their dwelling place, source of water, a place for making <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">pottery</a>, tools and weapons; and for protection from heavy rain and cold. Eventually, humans used caves to bury their dead, to perform ceremonial or ritual activities, and to express their artistic talents. Thus, such caves have a high cultural and scientific significance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines, the oldest known human fossil was retrieved in Callao Cave, Pe&ntilde;ablanca, Cagayan Province. Dated about 67,000 years old, this human fossil is the oldest that has yet been found in the Philippines. Callao Cave is one of the biggest caves in the massive Pe&ntilde;ablanca limestone formation, which is covered with lush vegetation. It is located on the formation&rsquo;s higher elevation. The cave opening is 50 m wide and 36 m high. Composed of seven large chambers with stalactites growing from the ceiling and stalagmites on the cave floor, the cave is well lit. Skylight from the large openings and the crevices on the ceiling illuminates the large chambers, making this cave ideal for habitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The most popular ancient habitation sites are found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/386\">Tabon Cave Complex</a> located in Lipuun Point, Quezon, Palawan Province. Archaeological explorations and excavations in the area since the 1960s have yielded numerous artifacts and ecofacts that provide insights on 50,000 years of Philippine prehistory. The most important find is the set of human remains dating to 47,000 years ago, recovered from a cave popularly known as Tabon. It is named after the flightless megapod bird that buries its eggs in a mound and is thus known as the &ldquo;Philippine mound builder.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tabon Cave is located at the foot of a cliff about 34 m above sea level, with one chamber and a big mouth, measuring 8 m high and 16 m wide. The large dome-shaped chamber, which is more than 40 m long, has stalactites growing on the ceiling. It is constantly sun-lit, making it a perfect place for human occupation. In this cave, studies made on the human remains and associated tools provide significant information on the subsistence patterns of humans during the Paleolithic Age, or the Old Stone Age (50,000&ndash;8,000 years ago). They were hunter-gatherers who lived in caves and used chert tools with sharp edges. In this cave, they hunted bats and birds, which were their primary sources of protein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bongao, Tawi-Tawi Province, a prehistoric habitation site that can be traced back to the Neolithic Period (8,810 to 5,190 years ago), was discovered in Balobok Rock Shelter, considered as one of the oldest and most significant archaeological sites in Mindanao. Located along a cove in Sanga-Sanga Island, the Balobok Rock Shelter is a coral limestone formation resembling an amphitheater, 19 m long and 10 m wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the interior of the rock shelter, the ground surface, or flooring, slopes slightly 12-15 m, then drops abruptly to the shore. The floor is 10 m above sea level while the sides extend to the water to form a cove, which has a sandy white beach. The archaeological excavation undertaken by the National Museum has yielded significant archaeological materials, such as shell adzes, that have had an impact on the reconstruction of the prehistory of the Philippines, Southeast Asia, and Pacific islands. Based on this archaeological information, Balobok Rock Shelter may have played a significant role in the movements of people into Southwest Pacific and to the Pacific World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Neolithic Period, about 3,000 years ago, a shallow rock shelter, measuring 63 m wide and 5 m high, was also used for artistic expression. Considered the oldest known work of art in the Philippines, the Angono-Binangonan Petroglyphs include 127 drawings of human-like, frog-like and lizard-like figures carved on the rock wall, which is made of volcanic tuff. In the Anda peninsula in Bohol, a rock shelter is likewise decorated with hand prints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The petroglyphs are representational symbols bearing some cultural content. In Maitum, Sarangani, archaeological excavations in Ayub Cave resulted in the discovery of unique anthropomorphic secondary burial jars that could be traced back to the Developed Metal Age, or about 2,005 years ago. This limestone cave is located in a coconut plantation traversed by a narrow road. The cave has an opening, about 2 m wide and 2 m high, which slopes downward. Considered as part of the sacred grounds in the past, Ayub Cave provides significant insights on Maguindanao prehistory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another significant site that was used for burial during the Age of Trade with Great Traditions of Asia is the Ipot Cave located in the Guyangan limestone cave system in Banton Island, Romblon Province. This cave is located in a very high cliff overlooking the sea, an ideal site for burial. In this cave were found two pieces of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2141\">Banton cloth</a>, which were associated with wooden coffin burial, and Yuan and Ming <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">ceramic tradeware</a> (ca 13-14th centuries AD). This is the oldest <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2119\">textile</a> ever found in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 19th century, the many caves of Marinduque, were documented, such as that of the island of Los Tres Reyes. The caves southwest of Boac have calcined walls and guano deposits. When discovered, these contained human bones and other relics. A larger cavern in the proximate area is partly hidden by vegetation and is entered through a small opening, which leads into several narrow galleries lined with bats. On the east coast of the island, about 70 m above sea level, are a cave and a grotto with volcanic debris and skulls, as well as funeral urns and ornaments. Nearby, a boulder blocks the entrance to another cavern. Among the caves found in Napo, Santa Cruz in the northern coast is one that opens into a vale and another, named Bathala, which has two burial chambers. East-southeast of Santa Cruz are silicon caves which are difficult to enter. These were likewise burial grounds that had been disturbed by landslides. Deep and empty caverns surround the mountain. The funeral cave at Pamin-Taan is intact and well preserved. The Macayon Cave has huge chambers below which are great depths and above which are hanging stalactites. The caves May-Igi and Padua are located in the vicinity of Boac, and are copper mines once rumored to contain gold. Still within the same vicinity, a 70-meter-high coral rock has five to six caves. Inside the lowest of these caves was discovered a small broken gargoyle and a skull covered with stalagmite. At the peak of this coral rock, an elevated vault crosses the entire top, from which corridors can be seen. Coffin debris and&nbsp;<em>tibor&nbsp;</em>(stoneware jars) were discovered inside one of these corridors. The little port of San Andres has near empty caves. One of these stands at the top of a 300-meter calcareous mountain and may have contained a considerable amount of carbonic acid. The entrance to this cave is through a well. In the Gasan area, a small mountain borders the coast line. Discoveries inside include burial traces and clay vases that contained a human skull, a little tibor, pearls, and urns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside the caves of<strong> </strong>Antipolo, Gasan were found little wooden statues. The caves of Manoche and Salombog had skulls, pieces of tibor, and a big broken plate. A kilometer from Pamin-Taan, near Boulen, was a cave containing pot debris and two sculptured coffins. Eggs of tabon were unearthed inside the caves of Moupon Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The functions that people put to the caves in their vicinity are also determined by historical necessity. In times of colonial repression, the caves were sites of native defiance and resistance. During the Spanish colonial period, babaylan priests and priestesses&mdash;such as Papa Isio of Negros, Tamblot of Bohol, and Tapar of Panay&mdash;gained a following of thousands, who continued to hold their secret rituals in mountain caves. Revolutionaries held their initiation rituals in caves, which were also their hiding places and forts, which foreign invaders continually tried to penetrate. Caves abetted such revolts as the 85-year-long Dagohoy rebellion (1744&ndash;1829) in Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Filipino-American war, caves served as armories for the Filipino guerillas. Maestranza Cave in Dingle, Panay, became an ammunitions factory. Gintabuan Cave (from Ilonggo&nbsp;<em>tabo</em>, &ldquo;encounter&rdquo;) in Silay-Patag, Negros Occidental, is the site of a major battle between the American invaders and the Ilonggo resistance fighters. In this cave they held off for several days until, having run out of ammunition and refusing to surrender, they charged down on the American troops. They were led by Lt Elias Magbanua, who belonged to a family of revolutionaries and resistance fighters, the best known of whom is his older sister, Teresa Magbanua.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Spanish-period chronicles, a cave in Gigantes Island, Iloilo, was called Longon-Longon (&ldquo;like a burial place&rdquo;), a name that is verified by the mark of a set of human ribs imprinted on the cave floor. However, in the people&rsquo;s memory, including that of the elders, it is called Bakwitan Cave. Oral tradition attests that a boulder in the cave was used during World War II to block the entry of Japanese soldiers into its deeper chambers. Bakwitan Cave is also an evacuation site against typhoons and storm surges, the deadliest of which was Typhoon Yolanda (international name Haiyan) in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the rainy season, when low-lying areas in Palawan become flooded, the Tau&rsquo;t Bato in Barangay Ransang move from their huts to live in caves and rock shelters. They settle at the cave mouths for light and air and where smoke from their firewood can make an easy exit. The natural formation of the cave walls provides ledges and supports for bamboo platforms to rest on. Each platform has a domestic function, such as the <strong>da-tag</strong> (sleeping platform), the family&rsquo;s living room, a makeshift dish rack, and so on. The cave ceilings and walls are sources of food, such as snails and bats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1971, an alleged &ldquo;Stone Age&rdquo; indigenous group called the Tasaday was announced to have been discovered living in caves on a mountain peak in South Cotabato. However, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> people, who are indigenous to the area, have always known of these caves they call Kilib Mata Awa (Caves of Mercy), which are on the mountain peak they call Tasaday. This system of caves is their holy ground, where they give offerings to their ancestor gods or take shelter when they travel long distances. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Monica P.

		"text": "<p>According to the Quran, the <strong>masjid</strong> are &ldquo;houses which Allah had permitted to be erected that his name be remembered in them,&rdquo; and therefore primarily centers of divine worship. Masjid is Arabic for &ldquo;a place for prostration,&rdquo; where the usual activities inside a mosque symbolizing complete surrender to Allah are done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the arrival of Islam in Sulu sometime during the 14th century and in Mindanao in the 15th century, the country was introduced to a type of organized religion which demanded a more permanent and separate place for worship. Thus, the tradition of mosque building began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, the mosque was just a courtyard encircled by a wall modelled after Muhammad&rsquo;s house in Medina, Saudi Arabia. Eventually, a minaret was added for the&nbsp;<em>azan&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>adhan&nbsp;</em>(call to prayer); then the mihrab (prayer niche), considered nowadays the most important part of the mosque as it indicates the direction of Mecca, the holiest city of Islam, toward which all Muslims pray; the&nbsp;<em>mimbar&nbsp;</em>(elevated pulpit) for delivering the&nbsp;<em>khutbah&nbsp;</em>(sermons); the dome, which represents the &ldquo;dome of heaven&rdquo; of the original open uncovered courtyard; and arches supported by pillars, as well as cloisters, both important elements of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Islamic</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/254\">architectural design</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>While the general features of Philippine mosques approximate the traditional mosque, some of its elements are peculiar to the country. The <strong>sahn</strong> (wide enclosed courtyard), for example, is generally absent; instead, benches are provided outside the mosque where people may sit and talk while waiting for the next prayer. Also, the mimbar is not as high as those of Africa and Western Asia. An elevated platform, a chair, or any similar structure could take the place of the mimbar in some mosques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, the call to prayer was usually done, until recently, not on tall minarets but inside the mosques as in Indonesia. Suspended drums called variously the&nbsp;<em>tabo, jabu-jabu</em>, or&nbsp;<em>dabu-dabu&nbsp;</em>are beaten to call the people to the mosque. Great care, however, is taken so that the sound of the drums in one mosque is not heard in nearby mosques; the same care is observed with respect to congregational prayers. While minarets may be present in Philippine mosques, they are usually not functional. The&nbsp;<em>bilal&nbsp;</em>(the one who calls the prayers) may simply stand in the mihrab found in the&nbsp;<em>quibla&nbsp;</em>(wall) that faces Mecca and call the azan there, traditionally with the beating of drums, with the help of a microphone and loudspeakers mounted on the domes or minarets.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Another interesting feature of Philippine mosques is the almost ubiquitous presence of the crescent and star ornament on top of many graceful domes all over the land. The use of&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">okir</a>&nbsp;</em>carving and the&nbsp;<em>burak&nbsp;</em>(a mythical winged creature, half-human, half-horse), and other motifs in highly colorful designs are also local adaptations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two types of mosques may be recognized in the Philippines: the masjid and the <strong>ranggar</strong> (Maranao) or <strong>langgal</strong> (Tausug and Yakan). The masjid is the &ldquo;larger and more permanent structure, built on stone foundations, often near a stream or a body of water&rdquo; (Gowing 1979). It is only in the masjid where the Friday noon assembly prayers, accompanied by a sermon, and Id observances may be held. The ranggar or langgal is some sort of chapel, a &ldquo;small semipermanent structure built for the convenience of the faithful who are not in easy walking distance to the masjid&rdquo; for the afternoon prayers during the Ramadan season. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> of Basilan Island, the langgal may sometimes serve as a mosque in the absence of a masjid so that even the Friday noon assembly prayers may be held there. It is described as a rectangular building elevated on piles, like the typical Yakan dwelling, although the side walls of the Yakan house of prayer do not reach up to the roof. Entrance is through the porch, which is normally covered by a roof somewhat lower than that of the main room, which is also a step higher than the porch. At the center of the opposite end wall is a&nbsp;<em>sunting&nbsp;</em>(niche) that faces the west. During services this part of the langgal is covered with cloth, but usually it is devoid of any decoration, like the rest of the place.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In a sense, the langgal of the Yakan is the equivalent of the Indonesian Javanese <strong>langgar</strong> and the Malaysian <strong>surau</strong>. Like the Javanese langgar, the Yakan langgal has a porch with a separate roof, and a large room with a&nbsp;<em>pangimbaran&nbsp;</em>(niche), and the whole house-like structure stands on piles in the same way as the langgar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The masjid was originally a three-tiered bamboo or wooden structure similar to a <strong>Chinese or Japanese pagoda</strong> or a <strong>Balinese temple</strong>, a pattern also common in Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula. A second style developed later, the more familiar onion-shaped dome on squinches set over a carpeted square or rectangular hall that can accommodate at least 40 (or 44 as in the case of Sulu) people at any given time. Perhaps this style emerged as a result of exposure to Middle Eastern mosques in the course of the Mecca pilgrimages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, while the pagoda type of masjid is the older of the two, the langgal is even older and antedates the former by several centuries. The oldest surviving example of the old multitiered pagodalike style is the Tubig-Indangan Mosque in Simunul Island, Tawi-Tawi, said to have been built in the 14th century by the celebrated Muslim figure Makdum Karim. According to Majul (1973), this must have been rebuilt several times. In particular, its roofing of palm leaves must have been changed many times, and its floor space must have been expanded at various times. But its four huge pillars of ipil wood are said to be the original. Two photographs, one taken in 1923 (in Orosa) and another in 1975 (in Majul), show the extent of the changes that have taken place on the structure. In the Orosa photograph, it appears as a slightly raised, cubelike adobe structure with a single pyramidal roof of nipa, while in the Majul photo, the nipa roof has given way to galvanized iron and shows not only one but two overlapping pyramids over which is a small minaret-like tower crowned by a bullet-shaped dome. Another dome has also been added over the mihrab. The interior views show a few windows and separate entrances for the men (on the sides) and the women (in front). As is typical in any mosque, the females do not go beyond the wooden screen while the males stay in the main prayer hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the area of Lake Lanao, opinions differ as to which is the oldest mosque. For the Taraka people, it is the Babo-Ramain Mosque, while other sources mention the mosque built in Bundi Alao in the&nbsp;<em>inged&nbsp;</em>(township of Ditsaan, presently a part of the Ditsaan-Ramain municipality). A number of mosques carrying this old, wooden, tiered roof style may still be found in diminishing numbers in the Ramain area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mosque with dome and minaret is more popular nowadays. Hundreds of this type are found in many Muslim communities around the Philippines. One of these is the Quiapo mosque, a part of the Islamic Center in Globo de Oro and Elizardo Sts. Designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2695\">Jorge Ramos</a>, it has stained-glass panels by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3528\">Antonio Dumlao</a>. It was built to symbolize the nation&rsquo;s Islamic heritage. The mosque is also located near the Quiapo church to highlight Muslim and Christian ties in Philippine society. Aside from the Quiapo mosque, other outstanding mosques of this style are the Grand Mosque of Bacolod in Lanao del Sur and the Blue Mosque in Maharlika Village in Taguig. Both of these retain traditional elements but incorporate modern features in design and planning, such as modern ablution facilities and, in the case of the Maharlika Mosque, a separate structure for the ritual washing of the dead prior to burial. The mosque complex may also accommodate a school, a library, a conference hall, and other function rooms around an open courtyard behind the main prayer hall or the mosque proper. Arabic geometric designs as well as large Quranic inscriptions have also become more common and have replaced in many places the traditional okir designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Islam continues to spread, larger mosques are being built. The King Faisal mosque near the entrance of Marawi State University, the Capitol Mosque, the Maahad Marawi Mosque, and the Central Mosque built by the late Acmad Domucao Alonto Sr. are examples of large mosques found in Marawi City. These are in the style of Middle Eastern mosques, characterized by the dome and minarets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The masjid has undergone numerous changes, but the main features have remained, their symbolic value strengthened and renewed in every new mosque constructed. This place of worship has continued to be a religious as well as a political, social, and cultural center for Muslims.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>munisipyo</strong>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>municipio</em>, refers to the town hall or a government building constructed during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American period</a> to house government offices on the municipal level. The munisipyo housed offices for the three branches of government, such as the office of the mayor, the chamber for the town council, offices to transact business like the city registrar&rsquo;s and the engineer&rsquo;s, and the municipal court and jail. Most munisipyo were built at the center of a town, but with the growth of their population, some towns have constructed new munisipyo at the outskirts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>At the beginning of American rule, the insular government merely co-opted the existing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a> (town hall) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\">tribunal</a> and made these into the town hall of a municipality. In 1901, an act of the Philippine Commission established the Bureau of Architecture and Control of Public Buildings. This bureau, abolished on 1 Nov 1905 and reorganized as the Division of Building Construction and Repair, was reestablished as the Division of Architecture by the Jones Law (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3467\">Casta&ntilde;eda</a> 1964, 55-56). This government office was tasked with designing and supervising the construction of public buildings, following the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassic style</a> favored by its US-trained Filipino architects. It built many munisipyo during the 1930s and the 1940s.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Porticos and vestibules were almost always inseparable parts of town halls built during these decades. Town halls were constructed using concrete or wood and concrete, and they had galvanized iron roofs. They had invariably two stories. Casta&ntilde;eda remarks that the &ldquo;incorporation of porticos in the structures was necessarily not the outcome of a dictum of the architects or designers, but usually that of the town dignitaries.&nbsp;<em>Alcaldes&nbsp;</em>(mayors) and the&nbsp;<em>concejales&nbsp;</em>(councilors) usually had the avowed option that a town hall would appear more dignified with them than without&rdquo; (Casta&ntilde;eda 1964, 63). However, the influence of government architects prevailed. By this time they had built neoclassical buildings in Manila, namely the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Post Office</a>, and the University of the Philippines buildings which employed porticos and colonnades.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Many early town halls resembled the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) because they were formerly either a tribunal or a casa real. The Macabebe, Pampanga town hall, which may have been a casa real, hews closely to the bahay na bato, as it is a simple frame building with wide eaves and an upper-story <strong>volada</strong> (protruding galleries). The portico, rising to the second floor, gives it the air of an American town hall. Wooden ionic columns support the roof of the portico, which has no pediment. Another town hall with the silhouette of a bahay na bato is the concrete two-story Tiwi, Albay munisipyo. The building has no portico; instead, a grand entrance approached by concrete steps in decreasing widths is the facade&rsquo;s most prominent feature. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a>, Bulacan town hall, a plain concrete structure built in 1940, has a portico of square pillars supporting a flat roof. The town hall of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Taal</a>, Batangas is a pleasing variation of the typical munisipyo design. A terrace on the second floor is supported by arches with quadrilateral pillars. The portico is in the central portion of the second floor. Four pilasters support the gabled roof. Balusters decorate the second story. The Tabaco, Albay town hall has four Doric columns rising to two stories to make up the shallow portico. Through these columns can be seen the balconies on the second story. The rectangular building has a low-pitched roof, in contrast to the Tiwi munisipyo&rsquo;s which has a high-pitched roof similar to that of the bahay the bato. While most munisipyo were built in the neoclassical idiom, some exceptions are noted, like the Sariaya, Quezon town hall which is art deco. A tall tower, decorated at its four corners by busts of women, is flanked by two wings to form a C-shaped plan. The entrance to the building is found in the tower and is approached by wide steps. Above the lintel of the main entrance is a concrete plaque depicting coconuts and other agricultural products of Sariaya. Similar in structure and style to Sariaya&rsquo;s is the municipal hall of Jaro, Iloilo.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>ospital</strong> or hospital is a specialized place intended for the care of the infirm. Its root word in Latin,&nbsp;<em>hospes</em>, meaning &ldquo;visitor,&rdquo; indicates that a hospital is a temporary place of residence and not a permanent one. Although hospitals are a permanent feature of the modern landscape, they were not known in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/208\">indigenous tradition</a>. The infirm and ill were treated in their homes by native healers who used herbs for a variety of cures and by the babaylan who invoked the help of the spirits. It was during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial period</a> that hospitals as specialized places were introduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spanish <strong>Period</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the course of Spanish colonization, a number of hospital types were developed. There was the general <strong>hospital</strong>. A smaller hospital was the <strong>enfermaria</strong> (infirmary). Hospitals and infirmaries were also set up in conventos and even <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">bishops&rsquo; houses</a>. Lepers were housed some distance away from the town in a <strong>leprosario</strong>. Members of the army were treated in a hospital or <strong>enfermaria militar</strong>, while those of the navy were assigned to a hospital or <strong>enfermaria naval</strong>. There were hospitals, mostly of an informal nature, built near thermal springs and medicinal waters. The <strong>hospicio</strong> or <strong>asilo</strong> was a place not only for convalescing patients but also for orphans and senior citizens and eventually for the mentally ill. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">Schools</a> such as the&nbsp;<em>beaterios&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>colegios&nbsp;</em>maintained their own clinics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical hospital was of two floors, built as a quadrangle with one or more inner patios. There were long halls for the patients, one each for the sexes. An important early segment was the <strong>botica</strong> (apothecary), where medicines and herbal cures were dispensed. There were spaces assigned for operating rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, storage, and a morgue. There were offices for the&nbsp;<em>mayordomo&nbsp;</em>(director), doctors and their assistants, and pharmacists or managers of the boticas. The larger hospitals had rooms for dignitaries. There were orchards and kitchen gardens, and a little distance away was a cemetery. There was always a chapel, even a church, with the corresponding sacristy and quarters for the chaplain and sacristans. Some hospital compounds were quite large. The hospitals of San Gabriel, San Juan de Dios, and the Hospital Militar, both in the old and new site, rivalled if not exceeded the area covered by the Plaza Mayor in front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>. Some 19th century hospitals incorporated insane asylums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The religious orders took the lead in health care&mdash;as hospital builders, physicians, pharmacists, and infirmarians&mdash;during most of the Spanish period. The most active were the Franciscans who arrived in 1578, and then the Hospitallers of San Juan de Dios who arrived in 1641. Each of the religious congregations had members who initiated the writing down and passing on of local remedies obtained from plants. The Daughters of Charity added to the work force in 1862. It is only in the 19th century when names of professional physicians and surgeons were encountered. The profession was enhanced with the establishment of the Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy in the University of Santo Tomas in 1871, a century after negotiations with Madrid had begun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Majority of hospitals were maintained by the religious orders that founded them, through alms collected from the faithful and through assistance from confraternities. Prelates conceded special blessings to those who aided hospitals and their work. The apostolate among the sick and dying was taken seriously by the religious orders. Felipe Pardo, a Dominican, remarked in 1673: &ldquo;For this Hospital [de San Gabriel] is the most pleasant garden that we have in the Province, where so many flowers are gathered for heaven.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government provided annual subsidies and material support. A hospital for Spaniards, later the Hospital Militar, and another for the natives, the Hospital de los Naturales, were ordered established by Philip II in 1574, together with their maintenance. The latter hospital received 1,500 cavans of unhusked rice, 1,500 chickens, and 200 blankets from the Ilocos every year. Some institutions were adopted by the bishops, although they let the friars continue their physical and spiritual ministrations. Some hospitals received tax-free proceeds from the Galleon Trade or rent from haciendas or cattle ranches. The Hospital de la Misericordia was greatly aided by the Hacienda de San Juan de Buenavista in what is now San Rafael, Bulacan. The hospital for the Chinese was granted by Gov-Gen Luis Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as the income from the river traffic between <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a> in 1595; this ended in 1629 with the construction of the Puente Grande, but the Chinese decided to support it themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hospital dedicated to the Santisimo Nombre de Jesus was inaugurated in Cebu by the confraternity of the same name in 1565, the first such institution established in the Philippines. Unfortunately, not much more is known about the survival of this hospital. Perhaps the most architecturally significant hospitals built during the Spanish period were what eventually came to be called the Hospital Militar, the Hospital de San Lazaro, the Hospital de San Gabriel, and the Hospital de San Juan de Dios, all in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospital Militar.</strong> Miguel Lopez de Legazpi established the Hospital Real in Manila, soon after founding the city in 1571. It was also known as the Hospital de los Espa&ntilde;oles because it cared only for Spanish males. By the 19th century it was called the Hospital Militar, where only members of the military were treated. It occupied a block of four irregular sides along Aduana St in Intramuros across the University of Santo Tomas and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\">Ayuntamiento</a>. Behind it, separated only by a narrow alley, was the Monasterio de Santa Clara. The hospital was burned in 1583 and 1603. After this, it was rebuilt in stone. With the acquisition of an adjoining lot in 1790, it was able to increase its capacity from 60 to 100 beds. Ruined by the 1863 and 1880 earthquakes, the Hospital Militar was rebuilt in 1883 according to modern standards along Calle Arroceros, on the site of today&rsquo;s old GSIS building across the MRT Central Station. The expansive quadrangle consisted of six one-story pavilions, separated from each other by gardens, with 60 beds each. After 1898, the Americans converted it into the Sternberg General Hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospital de San Lazaro.</strong> Soon after the arrival of the first Franciscans in Manila in 1578, Fray Juan Clemente, OFM, a lay brother, started receiving indigent patients and lepers in the monastery&rsquo;s <strong>porter&iacute;a</strong> or reception hall. In 1581, Fray Clemente moved his wards on a site across the road, on swampy land which had been newly filled with the help of Bishop Salazar of Manila. The wooden structure could accommodate 200 patients in two halls. It burned down in 1583 and was rebuilt in stone by 1598, this time with three dormitories. It was first known as the Hospital de Santa Ana, but since it accepted locals of whatever faith, it came to be called the Hospital de los Naturales. After another fire in 1603, it moved out of Intramuros to across the creek from the Franciscan convent of San Fernando de Dilao where the Manila City Hall now stands. Victims of communicable diseases were sent here. In 1623, it welcomed 130 Christian lepers expelled from Japan, after which the hospital&mdash;as well as the creek that ran past it&mdash;came to bear the name of San Lazaro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was ordered demolished in 1663 because of the strategic danger it posed on Intramuros, but was rebuilt in 1681. This time it crossed the creek to be just south of the Dilao convento and near the Balete creek, on the site of today&rsquo;s Technical University of the Philippines. The quadrangular building was of stone and brick. To lessen the danger of contamination, the clothes of the sick were washed in a special pool where the water did not empty into the rivers of the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After one more demolition in 1783, the Hospital de San Lazaro transferred to the former Jesuit hacienda of Meyhaligue on the outskirts of Santa Cruz district. The creek that flowed behind its west end likewise became known as the Estero de San Lazaro. The sprawling compound consisted of two great halls, one for each gender, with 100 beds in each hall. The halls opened onto open-air spaces for recreation. In the middle rose a church, which still stands. The facade features a richly ornamented entablature which recalls the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Baroque</a> era. In 1859, Fr Felix Huerta, OFM took charge of the hospital and improved its facilities. He moved the cemetery to a lot diagonally across, where the Espiritu Santo Church now stands. The lepers were transferred to Culion Island, Palawan. After 1898, the hospital was expropriated by the American government and the Franciscans were not allowed to return to the Hospital de San Lazaro which they had taken care of for three centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The San Lazaro compound is contiguous to the Jose R. Reyes Memorial Hospital&mdash;both are part of a bigger complex that occupies a large city block bounded by Tayuman St to the north, Quiricada to the south, Rizal Ave to the east, and Estero de Magdalena to the west. In this large block is the Department of Health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospital de San Gabriel.</strong> The Dominicans built a hospital dedicated solely to the Chinese, whether baptized or not. What was eventually called the Hospital de San Pedro Martir, built from 1587 to 1588, began as a shed with six beds. It was replaced by a larger one of wood in 1595, but after it burned down in 1597, it was rebuilt across the Pasig and renamed Hospital de San Gabriel. After another fire in 1604, a new hospital was finished in 1625. This one rested on heavy pillars of stone and had two halls that contained at least 70 beds. A third ward was added in 1639. This building seems to have survived the 1645 earthquake, but there were important renovations in 1728-30, 1738, and 1754. As retaliation against the Chinese who collaborated with the British, the Hospital de San Gabriel was closed in 1774. Thereafter, the vast compound was used for other purposes such as a rectory, government offices, military barracks, and apartments. In the 1920s, the decrepit buildings were sold to the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospital de San Juan de Dios.</strong> The site abandoned by the Hospital de los Naturales in 1603, which was by Calle Parian where the Lyceum now stands, was ceded by the Franciscans to the Hermandad de la Santa Misericordia. This charitable institution was founded in 1594 based on those established in Portugal and Macau. The Hospital de la Misericordia attended to patients of non-communicable diseases, including slaves. Spanish women were confined in separate quarters. In 1656, the one-story stone structure for 12 beds was ceded to the Hospitallers of San Juan de Dios, who added two more halls and a church. Subsequent structures were destroyed by earthquakes in 1664, 1674, and 1727.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1742, a grander compound had been erected, with a two-story quadrangular all-stone building attached to a richly decorated church. The botica was located at a corner of the cloister, with a window to the street. A cemetery occupied part of the corner plaza fronting the church and convento. This was not unusual&mdash;a cemetery also lay between the University of Santo Tomas and the Colegio de Santa Rosa. Both levels of the cloister, which opened onto a spacious patio, were arcaded (Maldonado de Puga 1742).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1850s, the three halls with 20 beds each had increased to 5 halls with 129 beds for men, 40 for women, 8 for dignitaries, 8 for cigarette vendors, and 16 for foreigners. The hospital also attended to out-patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the 1863 and 1880 earthquakes, a new building was erected according to the 1876 plan of Luis Cespedes (Aguilera Rojas 1998, 127). The quadrangular compound was divided into four quadrants, each with an inner patio. The chapel, with its iconic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Byzantine</a> dome, occupied part of a corridor cutting the compound in half; its apse fronted the Intramuros wall leading to the Parian gate. Abrogated <strong>voladas</strong> (protruding galleries) were uniquely incorporated onto the two faces of each of the four corners of the compound. The main entrance of the hospital opened onto the Calle Parian. A section of the ground floor was occupied by classrooms for the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Santo Tomas. There were consultation offices, laboratories, two halls for surgery, a delivery room, and a ward for prisoners. The hospital, the largest during the Spanish period, continued to operate until its total destruction during the Liberation of Manila in 1945. A new Hospital de San Juan de Dios opened in 1953 fronting Manila Bay along Roxas Blvd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Leprosaria.</strong> Hospitals for lepers were often dedicated to San Lazaro, himself a leper. These were erected some distance from the town. Many were built of masonry, but apart from the Hospital de San Lazaro in Manila, very few have survived to this day. Leprosaria are known to have been built in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu City</a> in 1850; in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, Ilocos Sur, and Laoag, Ilocos Norte, both in 1861; in Palestina, Naga, Camarines Sur, which was a hospital established in 1586 and revived in 1873; and in San Joaquin, Basco, Batanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Army and Navy Hospitals.</strong> The Hospital del Espiritu Santo was established by the Franciscans in 1591 for the Spaniards and natives working in the shipyards in Cavite Puerto. Its masonry building could accommodate 20 beds. The hospital was turned over to the Hospitallers of San Juan de Dios in 1642. It was destroyed and rebuilt several times, with the last reconstruction in 1885 under the Daughters of Charity. A second hospital was built in Cavite Puerto, this time in the Ca&ntilde;acao district on Sangley Point. The Hospital de la Marina de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores was erected in 1876 as an offshoot of the expedition against Jolo. It consisted of two one-story halls elevated above the ground by two meters and had 26 beds each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From about 1850, more and more army and navy hospitals and clinics were set up all over the country. These accompanied military operations especially in the Sulu Archipelago (Isabela de Basilan, Jolo, Bongao), in the Cotabato-Lanao area (Pollok, Cotabato, Tamontaca, Tumbao, Parang-parang, Tucuran, Pikit, Reina Regente, Iligan, Momungan, Ulama, and Marawi), in Davao, and in Palawan (Puerto Princesa, Balabac). Similar establishments were set up north of Manila in Olongapo, Vigan, Bangued, Bontoc, and Solano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although most of these hospitals were temporary in nature, built of timber or located inside palisaded forts, their design benefited from the research conducted by the military engineers in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/336\">Manila Observatory</a>. The 1873 Enfermaria Naval in Isabela, Basilan, was unique in that it was built on molave piles over shallow water. Like its 1876 counterpart in Ca&ntilde;acao, Cavite, it took on the indigenous way of construction. The 40-bed Basilan innovation comprised rooms for medicine, surgery, and eye operations, as well as a botica, a mess hall, and meeting and officers&rsquo; rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospitals next to Thermal or Medicinal Waters.</strong> The healing properties of thermal and medicinal springs led the friars to build hospitals or even simple <strong>balnearios</strong> (bathhouses) next to the sources of such waters. The most substantial building was that erected in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, a mission formerly called Mainit, founded in 1602 by the Franciscans. A two-story hospital dedicated to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Aguas Santas de Mainit was constructed of wood and stone around 1614. It featured <strong>celdas</strong> (cells) built over the vents of steam and hot water, and various pools, with water brought by bamboo pipes. There were separate quarters and baths for women. Renovations were undertaken in 1727, 1790, and finally in 1877, with plans by Fr Gabino Perez, OFM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Caysasay, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Taal</a>, Batangas, an arch carved with elaborate baroque leaves and tendrils was erected over the Balon ni Santa Lucia (Well of Saint Lucy). Pilgrims took baths in sheds with water drawn from two arched openings cut into the rock. Other places well known for their springs with bathhouses&mdash;actually little more than nipa sheds&mdash;were in Pakil, Laguna; Sibul, San Miguel, Bulacan; and Tiwi, Albay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospicios and Asilos.</strong> Nursing homes and hospices for senior citizens were often built close to each other. The most significant example began as a hospital for convalescents established by the Hospitallers of San Juan de Dios in 1729 on the Island of San Andres, now Isla de Convalecencia, in the Pasig River. Initially consisting of a hall for 12 beds, it was renovated to include eight rooms for dignitaries, a chapel, a cistern, and a garden. In 1849, it was ceded to the Hospicio de San Jose which was founded in 1782 as an asylum for the aged, the mentally ill, and orphaned children. In 1877, the Hospicio expanded into four one-story pavilions separated by gardens and patios, to accommodate 300 to 500 interns. Under this category may be included a Casa de Recogidas, a house for women of ill-repute, established in Intramuros in 1728. The house was rebuilt by the architect Tomas Cortes from 1820 to 1822. Though it did not last long, it gave its name to the street&mdash;Calle Recogidas&mdash;which was only changed later to Calle Anda. The female wards were sent to the Hospital de San Juan de Dios to do laundry and other chores (Guerra 1994, 562-3; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3763\">Santiago</a> 2005b, 93-4).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>American Period</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the many innovations the American colonial government introduced early in the 20th century was the campaign to improve the physical health of the Filipino. Sanitation and health were a priority for the government. Sanitation was a type of preventive medicine. Working toward this end, the Americans improved the water system to make available safe and potable water in homes or in publicly shared facilities, built sanitary <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">markets</a>, and supervised the butchering of animals and the handling of food in the market. In the capital Manila, following the program of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">urban development</a> prepared by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a>, the Intramuros moat was drained and filled with sand. It was later converted to a nine-hole golf course known as Municipal Golf. Esteros in Manila and all throughout the archipelago where there were large populations were periodically dredged to unclog them and allow the free flow of water. Periodic fumigation was instituted to kill malaria-bearing mosquitoes. The government launched a universal campaign on vaccination, the eradication of disease-carrying pests, and the vaccination of pets and farm animals. The Bureau of Health, headed by a medical doctor, managed the program for people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when such preventive measures failed, the Americans organized a system of hospitals and health clinics built on a tiered system. At the village level was the clinic and puericulture center which focused on the health of mothers and children. On the town or city level was the public general hospital. And on the national level was Philippine General Hospital (PGH), which was not only a hospital but a research center and training hospital attached to the University of the Philippines. Inaugurated in 1910, PGH was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a><strong> </strong> in the Mission Revival style. It was the largest building erected in the first decade of the 20th century. The plans, dated 1908 and 1909, show a building composed of several pavilions in parallel array. A front pavilion housing the administration leads to a central area where common facilities are located. Both sides of this central area branch out to the different pavilions which are separated by courtyards and connected by arcaded galleries. Each pavilion houses a department: medical, surgical, orthopedic, or maternity. One pavilion is devoted to private rooms. The plans indicate provision for future expansion&mdash;enough space for five additional wings. The building is formal and symmetrical, the plans being somewhat like an organizational chart. The design is most appropriate for the tropics, since each wing is designed for maximum ventilation and protection from rain. In the PGH, Parsons introduced a style of modern architecture, functional in plan, employing the traditional arch while minimizing surface ornament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the PGH was a training hospital, Nurses Home, a dormitory for nurses assigned to the PGH and for those in internship, was built in 1915 within the hospital compound on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Taft Ave</a> corner Padre Faura. Architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a> designed it in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Renaissance</a> style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since tuberculosis was then the fatal disease that claimed the most lives, it was inevitable that a sanatorium for tubercular patients would be built. The Quezon Institute, designed in the 1930s, a major work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, consisted of pavilions symmetrically arranged and liberally spaced out. The pavilions included paywards, and the teachers&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s pavilions. As with his other building of the same period, Juan Nakpil employed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> style. A native touch appears in the pitched roof of the central building. The Americans also built a laboratory for producing vaccines at the outskirts of Manila in Alabang. Here cattle was raised which were innoculated to produce vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Lazaro, which traced its roots to the Franciscan Fray Juan Clemente&rsquo;s hospital in Intramuros, transferred to Mayhaligue after the 1762-64 British occupation and the expulsion of the Jesuits who owned the property from 1636 to 1768. The Franciscans administered the hospital, named after St. Lazarus because it was a hospital for lepers, until 1898 when the Americans acquired it and repurposed the hospital to be a quarantine hospital for infectious diseases. The pre-World War II building was in the neoclassical style characterized by arches and an arched awning over the central entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another disease which Americans sought to contain was leprosy or Hansen&rsquo;s disease. Because leprosy was still considered incurable and communicable in the early 20th century, the Americans continued with the practice under Spain of isolating patients. The Cebu Leprosarium founded in 1850 continued to function. On 27 Oct 1902, the Second Philippine Commission called for the creation of the Culion Leprosarium, under the Director of Health. The first batch of 370 patients came from the Cebu Leprosarium and arrived in Culion on 27 May 1906. Located on a remote island in northern Palawan, Culion was seen as the ultimate place of segregation, where the most severe cases were sent. The whole island, under the Bureau of Health, was administered as a hospital rather than a municipality although the leprosarium developed as a small town. Culion leprosarium was divided into two districts: Colonia and Balala. Colonia was where the hospital and the houses for those recovered or recovering from leprosy were found. Balala, also known as Sano, was where the hospital staff, the priest chaplains, the nuns, and other who were free of leprosy lived. Culion had its own set of coinage, which was used in the island. Money from other places had to be exchanged for Culion&rsquo;s own money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another hospital that focused only on patients suffering from leprosy was the Central Luzon Sanitarium. More popularly known as Tala Leprosarium, it was the closest leprosarium to the country&rsquo;s capital. It was established in 1940 in Tala, Caloocan and is presently known as Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital (DJNRMH).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Privately run hospitals were allowed to continue, subject to licensing and periodic evaluation. San Juan de Dios moved from Intramuros to a site along Dewey Blvd. Its management was transferred to the Daughters of Charity. Singian Clinic in San Miguel and Adventist Manila Sanitarium (now Adventist Medical Center) were among the pre-World War II private hospitals. Manila Sanitarium was known for promoting a vegetarian diet, following the tenets of the Seventh-day Adventist who were vegetarian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hospitals all over the Philippines were tested to breaking point in 1945 during the liberation of the Philippines, when war left many casualties. Public buildings, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, had to be converted to temporary hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Period of the Postwar Philippine Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the period of rehabilitation and the rebuilding of damaged hospitals like the PGH, construction of new hospitals began in the 1950s. The largest construction project within a few years after World War II was the Veterans Memorial Hospital (now Medical Center), a sprawling two-story building with the front pavilions branching out at oblique rather than right angles. The hospital presided over vast grounds which have been developed into a golf course. A box-like structure with slab overhangs over the windows and parapets concealing the pitched roofs indicated the influence of the International Style. The hospital opened in 1955.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in the 1950s, the Children&rsquo;s Memorial Hospital (now Fe del Mundo Medical Center) located on Banaue Street, Quezon City and designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2646\">Cesar Concio</a> departed from the conventional plan consisting of wings or pavilions. All rooms were in one curving multistory block at the left side of the entrance, while at the right, in a low and compact block, were the auditorium and various common facilities. While the building exemplifies freedom of form in modern design, its shape was dictated by practical considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\">Luis Araneta</a>, the original Manila Doctor&rsquo;s Hospital on UN Ave, completed in 1956, was notable for introducing elegance into hospital design. The lobby was dominated by a curved stairway set against a large curved window. Rooms were liberated from antiseptic white walls and sported cheerful or soothing colors. The hospital was entirely air-conditioned, which was a novelty then. Jutting out on the right of the entrance was a restaurant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Makati Medical Center (MMC), Araneta&rsquo;s largest work, was built in 1965, and with its nine floors, was the tallest in its time. The building, a large rectangular block, was accented at one end by a cylindrical block housing operating rooms, the intensive care unit, the nursery, and private rooms. On the exterior were flat, horizontal strips that serve as sunshades. The MMC represented the high-rise trend in hospital design which continued in such buildings as St. Luke&rsquo;s Medical Center on E. Rodriguez Ave in Quezon City, Medical Center Manila on General Luna St, and the annex of the PGH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the martial law years, a project sponsored by First Lady Imelda R. Marcos was the expansion of the PGH. Along with the rehabilitation of the pre-World War II buildings was the addition of a seven-story tower complex. Respecting the lines of the heritage building, architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2695\">Jorge Ramos</a> echoed the arcades of the Mission revival style of Parsons. The completed project was inaugurated on 2 Jul 1985, Imelda&rsquo;s birthday. Ramos had earlier worked with Imelda in building the Philippine Heart Center, which came about after Imelda had visited Houston and had seen the specialized hospital dedicated to the circulatory system. Later, Imelda would push for other specialized hospitals along East Ave and the Quezon Circle in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine Heart Center for Asia in Quezon City, designed by Ramos and inaugurated on 14 Feb 1975, had two types of accommodations for patients: wards and private rooms. The latter were grouped into &ldquo;petals&rdquo;&mdash;that is, 10 to 14 rooms were clustered around the nurses&rsquo; station and were accessible to visitors through peripheral corridors, which were continuous glassed-in balconies. This arrangement required more space than the standard rows of rooms along corridors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as Marcos&rsquo;s Bagong Lipunan (New Society) forstered a return to one&rsquo;s roots through architecture, Imelda patronized local artists, commissioning large murals celebrating Malakas and Maganda that were installed in various buildings. The Philippine Heart Center mural portrayed her as a loving mother in Filipiniana, embracing the handicapped, the aged, and the infirm of all ages. Behind her were troops of doctors, nurses, and health specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Kidney Institute, also in Quezon City, was a two-story, Y-shaped building with a courtyard at the center. Recently, the hospital was remodeled with additional wings obscuring the original plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The floor plan of the Lung Center of the Philippines was basically two diamonds joined at their middle corners at the shaft of a T and hanging by their top corners from the arms of the same. The sides of the diamonds, called &ldquo;wings,&rdquo; contained the rooms and wards. Vertical bars running through the centers of the squares are supplementary corridors. The bottom of the T, aligned with the bottom corners of the diamonds, form the entrance area. The &ldquo;wings&rdquo; of the building do not spread out but are folded and interconnected in a compact plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imelda also spearheaded the construction of the Philippine Children&rsquo;s Medical Center along Quezon Blvd and near the Quezon Circle. This hospital was especially dedicated to children with rare and terminal diseases like cancer. The center, established in 1980, was in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">modernist</a> style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1970s, early detection and multiple drug therapy had greatly reduced the progression and spread of leprosy that both Culion and Tala began to phase out their exclusive health program for leprosy. Assisted by private foundations and the United Nations, an aggressive program to eliminate leprosy was launched. Culion was one of the key hospitals where discovery and trials of drugs that cured leprosy was conducted. By the late 1980s, leprosy was no longer considered a threat, so in 1992 a law making Culion a municipality was passed and in 1995, the first municipal and barangay elections were held. Similarly, the 808-hectare property of Tala Leprosarium was reduced to 130, with the rest of the property turned over for the housing of previous patients who had been cured. Tala has effectively become a general hospital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the post-Marcos era, there were rapid developments in medical science and technology, and clients and patients expected specialized services and sophisticated facilities. These factors increasingly challenged the ingenuity and creativity of architects in designing hospitals and medical centers that had the latest in medical technology while exuding the air of a hotel or resort. New structures were built in the suburbs like the Medical City in Ortigas Ave, St Luke&rsquo;s Medical Center at the Bonifacio Global City, Cardinal Santos in San Juan City, and the Asian Hospital along the South Expressway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the provinces, Cebu Doctors Hospital and Maria Reyna in Cagayan de Oro have also upgraded and built new structures. These hospitals vary in design. Most are modernist. But what is common among them are the integration of new equipment and modern methods of health care and the effort to make a hospital more appealing to patients. Newer hospitals give an impression of being more like hotels rather than a place for the infirm. Amenities such as fastfood outlets, mini-groceries, pharmacies, and an independent medical arts building for outpatients are included in the design. Depending on one&rsquo;s budget, room choices can be simple like wards or suites like five-star hotels.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong>, with notes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p><strong><strong>Palacio</strong></strong>, which is Spanish for &ldquo;palace,&rdquo; is a generic term designating the residence and office of the highest official, civil or ecclesiastical, during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial era</a>. The term was applied to the Palacio Real del Gobernador/Governador or Palacio Real, Palacio Episcopal (Bishop&rsquo;s Palace), Palacio Arzobispal or Arzobispado (Archbishop&rsquo;s Palace), and Malaca&ntilde;an or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malacanang Palace</a>. By analogy, any large and opulent residence may be called palacio or <strong>palasyo</strong> in Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Palacio Real del Gobernador</strong>/<strong>Governador</strong>. The original location of the first Palacio Real in the 1600s was near <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> facing Plaza Militar, until its destruction in the 1645 earthquake. Then Gov-Gen Diego Fajardo, 1644-53, moved it to a confiscated house formerly owned by Real Audiencia member Manuel Estacio Venegas. Its first true resident was Gov-Gen Sabiniano Manrique de Lara who occupied the palace on 19 Jul 1654. The house functioned as the governor&rsquo;s residence and office, as well as the office of the Real Audiencia or Supreme Court.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>During the term of Gov-Gen Fausto Cruzat y Gongora, 1690-1701, when the Palacio was rebuilt in the Hispanic idiom, there appeared to have been a north wing where the Royal Audiencia (until it had its own building in 1788), the Royal Secretariat, Royal Account Office, and Royal Treasury were located, and a south wing with the upper floor occupied by the governor general and his family. The secretary of the governor was located on the lower floor. The two wings branched out from a central atrium. The main facade had two front doors facing the Plaza Mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A grand stairway led from the front door. On this stairway, Gov-Gen Fernando Manuel Bustamante, 1717-19, was assassinated on 11 Oct 1719. Brig Gen William Draper occupied the building during the British occupation in 1762. The earthquake of 1 Feb 1771 destroyed this Palace, forcing Gov-Gen Simon de Anda, 1770-76, to move to a temporary residence in Santa Cruz, then to an infirmary of the Augustinians in Cavite until 1776.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1850, Gov-Gen Narciso Claveria had redesigned the Palacio in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> style. The renovated grand staircase that led to the Sala de Besamor (Reception Hall) was inaugurated by Gov-Gen Manuel Crespo y Cebrian, 1854-56, on 19 Nov 1855 in honor of Queen Isabela II. Periodic reconstruction and alteration changed its plan until it was destroyed by another earthquake. The 19th century structure was a two-story building in the neoclassical idiom. On 3 Jun 1863, eve of Corpus Christi, a strong earthquake severely damaged the structure, along with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\">Ayuntamiento</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>. Gov-Gen Rafael de Echague, 1862-65, moved temporarily to Colegio de Santa Potenciana, the current site of the Philippine Red Cross Manila Chapter. Due to the summer heat, the governor-general moved to Posesion de Malaca&ntilde;an, the official summer residence purchased by the government from Don Luis Rocha in 1825. Initially proposing to rebuild the Palace, Gov-Gen Echague eventually stopped the construction in favor of moving permanently to Malaca&ntilde;an.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov-Gen Rafael de Izquierdo, 1871-73, campaigned for the restoration of the Palacio del Gobernador with an approved budget of 100,000 pesos for reconstruction. But the Palacio was never rebuilt. When the Philippine Revolution broke out in 1896, the project was abandoned, and the occupying Americans opted to improve on Malaca&ntilde;an Palace instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site of the Palacio in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> was used as a plaza during the American Period. The present Palacio del Gobernador is a high-rise government building constructed in 1976 before the enactment of Presidential Decree No 1616 in 1979 which regulated building construction in the designated historical zone of Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Malaca&ntilde;an Palace.</strong> The decision of Governor Echague to move to the summer home formerly owned by Don Luis Rocha sealed Malaca&ntilde;an&rsquo;s future as the residence of the top executive of the Philippines. The American military governors and governor-generals chose to move into Malaca&ntilde;an during the pre-World War II era. Malaca&ntilde;an and its grounds then underwent renovation, and new facilities were constructed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first American executive to occupy Malaca&ntilde;an was Major Gen Wesley Merritt, whom American president William McKinley appointed as commander of the expeditionary forces to the Philippines. He stayed in Malaca&ntilde;an a mere 16 days in Aug 1898. The following month, Major Gen Elwell Otis replaced Merritt who stayed until he was replaced by Maj Gen Arthur MacArthur in 1900. In 1901, Howard Taft was appointed as the first civil governor, later renamed governor-general, of the Philippines. Received in grand style in Malaca&ntilde;an by MacArthur on 4 Jul, Taft moved in with his wife Nellie, three children, a Japanese maid, and Mrs. Taft&rsquo;s sister, Maria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malaca&ntilde;an then was basically a large <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) in the traditional late Spanish colonial style. It had two stories, the lower floor being made of stone and the upper, of wood. Sliding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>capiz</strong></a> windows, <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows), and sliding windows under the window sill allowed for a well-ventilated upper floor. The house was approached either through the northwest end facing Aviles St (now J. P. Laurel) or through the southeast riverine route facing the Pasig. During the Spanish era and early in the 20th century, the river route was more commonly used. Here, a projecting dock was built, covered by an open balcony. The formal entrance to the house was through its side between the northwest and southeast. It had an overhanging second floor, supported by wooden pillars and reinforced by diagonal brackets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taft had the house renovated to accommodate rooms for his family, especially, a nursery for the children. Nellie Taft loved the house with its expansive garden and old trees, the view of the Pasig and a still unobstructed view of the cordilleras to the northeast. Parties and social gatherings were part of the imperial life style of the governor-generals, and Nellie Taft had the trees lining the Pasig transferred so that a wide promenade could be built along the banks of the Pasig. Here guests mingled and socialized in the open air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequent governors-generals would add their own touch here and there, but the first major renovation was done under Gov-Gen William Cameron Forbes who assumed governorship in 1909. He commissioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2690\">William Parsons</a> to reconstruct the floor system, introduce fire proof reinforced concrete to replace wooden structural elements, and reconstruct the dining area. Parsons respected the traditional lines of the house, replicating in concrete what was once timber. He was charmed by &ldquo;an old Spanish building [having] a good deal of character and charm&rdquo; (Quezon III et al. 2005, 138).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two governor-generals, Francis Burton Harrison and Dwight Davis, did much to renovate Malaca&ntilde;an as the seat of executive power. While previous governors went to the Ayuntamiento to work, Harrison preferred to conduct business in Malaca&ntilde;an. In 1921, he inaugurated the Executive House designed by Richard Doane, the consulting architect of the Bureau of Public Works. Davis added a new wing to house Harrison&rsquo;s large family. Malaca&ntilde;an was demolished and rebuilt, retaining its historic appearance. Malaca&ntilde;an contractor was Marion M. Karolchuck, a Greek who worked on the Paco Church. Under Davis, the palace grounds were improved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1935, Malaca&ntilde;an was occupied by Quezon after he was elected president of the Philippine Commonwealth. The last American governor general, Frank Murphy, then moved to the Mansion House at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a>, while a residence for him was being built along Manila Bay. That residence is now the American Embassy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Quezon, Malaca&ntilde;an underwent expansion. Office spaces were built because Quezon preferred to work in Malaca&ntilde;an rather than in the Executive House as the American governor generals had done. A boat house was built for the launch used to cross to Malaca&ntilde;an Park and down the Pasig. The Executive House was expanded by the addition of extra stories. New gates were installed and the gardens improved and planted with Do&ntilde;a Aurora (Mussaenda Philippica var. Aurorae), a shrub with white leaves, named after First Lady Aurora Quezon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Malaca&ntilde;an itself was only slightly damaged during the liberation of Manila in 1945, it did not escape looting and so lost its furnishings. After World War II, Pres Manuel A. Roxas did little to improve Malaca&ntilde;an because the government set as priority the rehabilitation of the country. It was his successor, Pres Elpidio Quirino, who refurbished Malaca&ntilde;an. Amalia Pastor, Malaca&ntilde;an&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/215\">interior designer</a>, was tasked to make the place less dark and oppressive. Quirino&rsquo;s expenses in refurbishing the palace was met with criticism and became an issue in the election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the frugal Ramon Magsaysay, Malaca&ntilde;an remained largely unchanged from the Quirino era. When <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\">Carlos P. Garcia</a> assumed office, he preferred to spend time in his home at Bohol Ave in Quezon City, rather than in Malaca&ntilde;an. While Garcia commissioned sculptures from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a> who later on became <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2123#awards\">National Artist</a>, his administration did not do much renovation on Malaca&ntilde;an. &ldquo;By the Garcia years, visitors came to view the Palace at this time as dowdy, if not frumpy and down-at-heel&rdquo; (Quezon III et al. 2005, 244). During the Macapagal presidency, First Lady Eva Macapagal worked on Malaca&ntilde;an, cleaning it of debris and improving the garden. The open policy of Magsaysay continued to the Macapagal presidency and visitors would stroll freely in the gardens. With Architect<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\">Luis Araneta</a> as consultant, Mrs Macapagal improved, refurbished, and redecorated Malaca&ntilde;an. The Reception and Social Halls were renovated and the palace, which had changed over time with additions and subtractions, was unified in design without sacrificing the historic accretions on the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Macapagal lost his bid for reelection to Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1965. First Lady Imelda Marcos then launched a series of renovations that would stretch through the Marcos&rsquo; years. In this era, Malaca&ntilde;an was used for statecraft. The palace was now a leading platform in projecting Philippine culture through architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1965, the Marcos Room was added to the residential section. The Executive Building erected in 1921 by Harrison had its second floor cleared to make way for the Maharlika Hall in 1975. This building housed the office of the president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1978 to 1979, Imelda had the residential area renovated. Windows were covered with bullet proof glass, the external walls were pushed forward, and central air conditioning was installed. At the east and residential wing, an open atrium from the time of Gov-Gen Dwight Davis was covered with a colored fiberglass skylight showing stylized coconut leaves in a sunburst design of eight rays. On the second floor of the atrium, bas-reliefs carved by Paete artisans interpreted the historical works of Angono-born National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a>. The private quarters of the First Family were paneled with Philippine hardwood, given a coffered ceiling, and decorated with carvings by Betis artisans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main wing, Kalayaan, housed the Rizal Hall or Ceremonial Hall, the place for grand meetings with a large group. Like the residential quarters, the hall was paneled with hardwood and had two domed coffered ceilings reminiscent of the ceiling design of the Pantheon in Rome. At the center of the ceiling hung crystal chandeliers. Swags and other ornaments of carved wood decorated the curtained entrances. Capiz was used to filter light coming through the windows and capiz dividers were used to mark out space. On a background of hardwood carved to resemble sawali or woven bamboo was the presidential seal. Under the seal, the president and his guests would sit on a long raised platform. The floor was carpeted crimson with yellow gold trim designed as a braided rope and swags of foliage. All told in 1979, seven years after the declaration of martial law, Malaca&ntilde;an was awash with the elements of the Bagong Lipunan (New Society) nationalist aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Aquino, Ramos, Estrada, and Macapagal-Arroyo presidencies, Malaca&ntilde;an had various uses. Corazon Aquino did not want to live in Malaca&ntilde;an because of its association with Marcos. She lived in a Malaca&ntilde;an guest house on Arlegui St and renovated the former San Miguel Brewery, acquired during the Marcos era, to serve as the new Executive House. The 1921 Executive House was renamed Kalayaan Hall, and Malaca&ntilde;an became a museum that exposed the excesses of the Marcoses. Fidel V. Ramos, who succeeded Aquino to the presidency restored Malaca&ntilde;an to its former function by returning to Malaca&ntilde;an and using Marcos&rsquo;s office. He repaired the palace that had been damaged by typhoons. His successor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> decided to take residence at the Premier Guest House and improved it to be a residence and office. The interior of Malaca&ntilde;an was refurbished. But on 20 Jan 2001, he was forced out of office, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took over as president. She renovated Malaca&ntilde;an, cleaning it of the personal effects of the Marcos family, which were turned over to the Presidential Commission for Good Government. She created a Presidential Briefing Room similar to the White House Situation Room. She recovered historic furniture, restored Kalayaan Hall, and spruced up the garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Palacio Episcopal.</strong> In 1595, during the Spanish era, the diocesan structure of the Philippines was organized. Manila was raised to an archdiocese with four suffragan or dependent dioceses: Nueva Segovia, initially based in Lallo, Cagayan, then transferred to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, Ilocos Sur in 1758, Nueva Caceres in Naga, Camarines Sur, Cebu in 1595, and Jaro, Iloilo in 1865. During the Spanish colonial period, the archdiocese and all the dioceses had a palacio. From these residences, usually next to the cathedrals, the administration of the archdiocese and the dioceses was facilitated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only remaining example from the Spanish era of a palacio episcopal which is still functioning as such is the one in Vigan, Ilocos Sur, raised to an archdiocese in 1951. Presently known as Arzobispado de Nueva Segovia, Vigan&rsquo;s episcopal palace is an oversized bahay na bato. Its date of construction is uncertain, but it was most likely built around the same time as the cathedral in 1790. Built parallel to the Cathedral of the Conversion of San Pablo or the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/397\">Vigan Cathedral</a>, the palacio is a longitudinal two-story building with a lower floor of stone and an upper floor of wood. A central arched entrance on the first floor leads to the grand staircase that connects the lower floor with the upper floor. The palacio functions as archdiocesan office, museum, and residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nueva Caceres or Naga&rsquo;s episcopal palace was first built near the bank of the Naga River, along a street presently named Calle Caceres. Called Casa de Clerigos, the first structure was of provisional material, and it was not until the time of Bp Antonio Obrigo Gallego, OFM, that a stone structure 27&nbsp;<em>baras&nbsp;</em>(yards) long was built. This two-story structure had an upper floor supported by arches and a tile roof. By 1783, the building was substantially finished except for the roof which was only partially covered with tiles. In 1797, a seminary was officially established in the casa. It seems that the casa served as episcopal palace, residence of the cathedral canon, and seminary. Because of flooding, Fr Bernard de la Concepcion, bishop 1816-29, decided to move the residence and the cathedral to its present site. This building would suffer damage, repair, and expansion until 1879 when Bp Francisco Gainza assessed the condition of the building as severely damaged. He had the building demolished and a new one built. That building still stands and has been known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/308\">Holy Rosary Minor Seminary</a> since 1964. The post-World War II archbishop&rsquo;s palace transferred to a lot east of the seminary and the cathedral on Elias Angeles Ave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The site of the bishop&rsquo;s palace of Cebu, built by Bp Santos Gomez Mara&ntilde;on, OSA, 1829-40, was across the Cebu Cathedral, on P. Burgos St. When it was destroyed during World War II, Julio Cardinal Rosales, then archbishop of Cebu, transferred the palace to a larger piece of property along Jakosalem St, beside the Diocesan Shrine of the Sacred Heart (formerly Sacred Heart Parish). The ruin of the old palace was torn down and a new building, Patria de Cebu, a diocesan hostel and center, replaced it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jaro became a diocese in 1865, when it was separated from Cebu. Fr Mariano Cuartero, OP was appointed as the first bishop. It is uncertain where the bishop&rsquo;s palace was during the Spanish era, but most likely it was in the convento of the Cathedral of Santa Isabel de Hungria. The present palace, built along Seminario St and facing the Jaro Plaza or Graciano Lopez Jaena Park, is known as Arzobispado de Jaro. It is a post-World War II work by Juan Nakpil, built during the incumbency of Abp Jose Maria Cuenco, 1951-72, first Filipino bishop of Iloilo. The house uses elements from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical</a> architecture like the arch windows and is laid out in the manner of a residence, where the offices are on the bottom floor and the residential area is on the upper floor. Due to the widening of the street in front of it, the road runs very close to the building, with only a narrow sidewalk separating it from the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The palacio or arzobispado of the Archdiocese of Manila was the residence and office of the Archbishop of Manila. The palacio was built along Arzobispo St, parallel to Calle Real del Palacio in Intramuros. The earliest palacio, built in anticipation of the arrival of Bp Domingo de Salazar, OP in 1581, was a makeshift house of wood, bamboo, and nipa. This humble residence was destroyed by fire in 1583 but rebuilt in stone, brick, tiles, and wood by Bp Salazar and Fr Antonio Sede&ntilde;o, SJ soon after. This and subsequent buildings were weakened or destroyed by earthquakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 19th century, the Archbishop&rsquo;s residence, like all the other parochial residences in the islands, probably resembled a large bahay na bato with multiple living quarters, but grander in scale. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5007\">Teodoro Agoncillo</a> irreverently describes the turn-of-the-century Archbishop&rsquo;s Palace in Intramuros as follows: &ldquo;the Archbishop&rsquo;s Palace, a building that did not look like a palace but a well-appointed Antillean house [obsolete term for the bahay na bato] of a get-rich-quick Spaniard of dubious morality.&rdquo; Although the exigencies of living in an island setting probably dictated the principles of traditional Philippine tropical architecture for the palacio, the fashion of the period probably dictated ornamentation of late Revivalism of the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the new colonial regime, the American Government leased the old palacio for Manila&rsquo;s Court of First Instance.The arzobispado in Intramuros was heavily damaged during World War II, so it had to be transferred to Tayuman and then to San Miguel, both in Manila. In the 1950s, then-Vicar General Rufino Santos moved the arzobispado to Villa Grimault in Shaw Blvd, Mandaluyong. The villa was renamed Villa San Miguel in honor of San Miguel Arcangel, the archbishop&rsquo;s patron saint. By the 1960s, the Grimault was infested with termites and was torn down, and the present villa, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2708\">Jose Ma Zaragoza</a>, was built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The present offices of the Arzobispado de Manila were built in the late 1980s on a site next to the old palacio in Intramuros. This structure, which now houses the Archdiocesan Museum and Ecclesiastical Offices of the Archdiocese, resembles an oversized bahay na bato on the outside. Inside is a multistory building. An archdiocesan guesthouse built earlier became the Archbishop&rsquo;s Residence, when the Archdiocese of Manila was divided into suffragan dioceses: Para&ntilde;aque and Novaliches (Quezon City North), established in 2002; and Pasig and Quezon City, established in 2003. When Abp Gaudencio Cardinal Rosales moved into the archbishop&rsquo;s residence in Intramuros, Villa San Miguel became the archdiocesan guesthouse.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ren&eacute; Luis Mata, with notes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>palengke</strong>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>palenque</em>, meaning palisade, is also known as <strong>tiyangge</strong> and <strong>tindahan</strong>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>tienda</em>, meaning &ldquo;merchandise for sale,&rdquo; and the Tagalog&nbsp;<em>han</em>, a suffix to denote place. It is a place or a building for buying and selling goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A specific building for the buying and selling of goods is absent in the ethnolinguistic communities of the Philippines. Instead, the trading of goods occurs at certain times, and any flat or unbuilt area is set aside for such transactions. Sites chosen for trade are usually accessible to many communities. Hence places like riversides, seashores, and deltas become market areas. The number of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">tradeware</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">beads</a> found in archaeological sites amply demonstrates that Philippine communities have long been trading with each other and with their Asian neighbors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tradition of setting aside a time rather than a building for the sake of trade persists even today among lowland Filipinos. During certain times of the week, merchants go to a particular town to sell their wares and by nightfall have packed their goods to sell to the next town. The day for the itinerant market is set by tradition. This market also follows the calendar of fiestas in a given area. Temporary stalls may be set up days before the festivities and are taken down after and moved to another place where another fiesta is about to be celebrated. This itinerant market is called <strong>tabu</strong> (Cebuano for &ldquo;meeting&rdquo;) in Cebu or <strong>mercado</strong> (Spanish for &ldquo;market&rdquo;) in other places.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A tabu is usually a conglomeration of stalls made of bamboo and canvas that are easy to disassemble. When the stalls are not knocked down but remain in a place for a considerable length of time, they are collectively called <strong>talipapa</strong> in Tagalog. Usually a fish stall, the talipapa set up by private initiatives may begin as a temporary setup, then gain permanence and recognition in the course of time. Stalls may be of wood, galvanized sheets, salvaged building materials, and materials solicited from companies selling goods. Stalls usually have simple flat roofs. In neighborhoods, a retail store called <strong>sari-sari</strong> (literally, &ldquo;mixed&rdquo;) is set up by small entrepreneurs. The sari-sari carries foodstuff, cosmetics, hardware, and other goods that might be needed in an area. As a convenience store, it brings goods within easy reach, and the practice of selling goods at retail and sometimes on loan makes it an important economic institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign loan words indicate the cultural influences that have created the Filipino concept of market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the establishment of the Galleon Trade, the Spanish presence in the Philippines was assured. To meet the demand for trade goods and also goods for local consumption such as food, cloth, and building materials, as well as to meet the need for services, the Spaniards allowed the Chinese, already present and trading in the Philippines, to continue with their business in a specific area assigned to them. That area, segregated from the Spaniards, was called <strong>parian</strong>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a>, Manila, and other large towns, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, Ilocos Sur and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a>, Bulacan had a parian. That of Cebu was located on one side of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/286\">cathedral</a> block and around the church specifically built for the Chinese. By 1595, the large number of Chinese prompted Bp Pedro Agurto to request that the Jesuits begin a mission for them. The general area of Cebu&rsquo; s parian has not changed much over the centuries, in contrast to Manila&rsquo;s, which moved at least six times. The earliest location of the parian in Manila was within the walls of the city, but not trusting the Chinese, the Spaniards evicted them and told them to settle in the general area presently occupied by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Manila Post Office Building</a>. The parian was within the range of the cannons mounted on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">walls of Intramuros</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chinese merchants and the Spanish rulers had an uneasy relationship. The Spaniards needed the Chinese for their needs and so tolerated their presence. By 1727, the parian was a village of well-built houses on whose ground floors business was conducted. It was also a thriving parish under the patronage of the Three Kings. In 1758, the Alcaiceria de San Fernando was constructed in the populous Chinese village of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>. Only the Pasig river separated the Alcaiceria from the northern flank of Intramuros. This two-story octagonal building contained several shops for merchants. Destroyed by fire in 1810, it was not rebuilt, probably because by this time many other stores and shops were already operating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The typical market, even the itinerant one, sold food, clothing, utensils, equipment, and many others. The stores that opened in Binondo were actually the intermediary state between the early markets and the modern-day supermarket or grocery. In these buildings, which had two stories and a mezzanine or three stories, the top floors were the residences of the owners and their family, while the ground floors were the stores. These stores sold just about anything except the perishable foodstuff which had to be bought at the palengke. Stores in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a> and also in Cebu&rsquo;s parian had awnings over the entrance to shield passersby or potential customers from the heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently, foodstuff was sold in open areas, in the tabu or in the talipapa, during the Spanish era. Only toward the era&rsquo;s end were permanent markets built. One such market was the Arranque designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2661\">Juan Hervas</a>, a government architect. When the Americans started to govern the Philippines, they found two systems of trading: in the stores were canned goods, preserved foods, clothing, and other dry goods, while in the palengke, popularly called the wet market, were rice, fresh meat, fish, fruits, and vegetables. Sizing up the inadequacy of these structures, especially with respect to sanitation, the Americans built public markets all over the Philippines. Markets in Manila built during the American period include that of Paco ca 1910, restored in 2013 by Kapit Bisig para sa Ilog Pasig (Link Arms for the Pasig River) and partners in the business world. Perhaps the most attractive and best known of the American-built markets was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio&rsquo;s</a>. The site of the market was already in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Burnham</a>-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">Parsons</a> plan. The Baguio market consisted of one-story structures built along a wide passage. Each structure had many stalls in it, with some at the outer flanks of the building and other stalls facing a central interior corridor. Perpendicular to this corridor were narrow passageways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the contemporary developments is the supermarket. Borrowed from the United States, the supermarket puts together the wet market and the grocery. Perishable goods are sold in specially designated areas where the goods are preserved in refrigerators. The goods may come prepackaged or sold by weight. A recent addition to the urban skyline is the mall, also called galleria. The mall, an American building concept, is a covered or open concourse flanked by shops. The concourse may be one or two stories with continuous balconies serving as access to the shops on the higher floors. Malls contain a variety of shops, including a grocery, and are modern versions of the shopping or marketing district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In large urban centers, a reaction against preserved and instant foods has resulted in a return to organic farming and to home-cooked food&mdash;a movement known as &ldquo;slow food&rdquo; in contrast to fast food. This new consciousness about food and health has increased the popularity of the <strong>weekend organic market</strong>, an urban version of the traditional tabu, where sellers bring their produce straight from the farm to the consumers who buy them fresh. Like the tabu, food stalls in these markets are temporary.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>parola</strong>, which comes from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>farola&nbsp;</em>that originated from the Latin&nbsp;<em>faro&nbsp;</em>and the Greek&nbsp;<em>pharos</em>, means &ldquo;lighthouse.&rdquo; It is a structure built on a promontory, island, or rock to guide ships passing through a narrow channel or an area filled with rocks or sandbars. Strategically located, it indicates where a ship might safely pass. The parola first appeared during the mid-19th century and became necessary with increased international trade and the development of steamships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In previous centuries the bell tower of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> served as a beacon, with lights hanging from it to guide ships. The practice continued up to the 20th century, as indicated by the report of the Philippine Commission of 1903 which states that the light at San Nicolas, Cebu harbor was &ldquo;exhibited from a small platform on the south face of a church tower&rdquo; (<strong><em>Fourth Annual Report of the Philippine Commission</em> <em>1903</em></strong>, 193). A light could also be hoisted on a pole or hung from a tall tree. In Batanes, an ingenious system of navigation was built consisting of a monolith with a hole at the top end. Behind the monolith was another stone on which a storm lamp was lit. When visibility was low, the boatman would fix his vision on the light in the cavity of the monolith to guide the boat safely to the shore.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A 19th century parola consisted of a high tower that has a light or beacon, either electrical or chemical, on its upper story. Usually the tower tapered at the top and could be a polygon in plan or a cylinder. The topmost story was walled in by glass plates and had a catwalk built around its perimeter to allow cleaning and maintenance of the light. Below the light were the living quarters of the lighthouse keeper. Parola built during the Spanish era were usually of bricks or cut stone, although iron towers were also used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many extant parola were built in the last decades of the 19th century such as those in Burgos, Ilocos Norte, guarding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/277\">Cape Bojeador</a>; Palauig Island, Cagayan, guarding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/278\">Cape Enga&ntilde;o</a>; Corregidor, guarding the entrance to Manila Bay; Malabrigo, Lobo, Batangas, guarding the Verde Island passage to Tayabas Bay; Capul Island, Northern Samar, guarding the San Bernardino Strait; and Jintotolo Island south of Masbate. A number were not completed or were modernized by the Americans as early as 1903. They had more modern lights manufactured in Europe installed, repaired old buildings, or constructed new ones. In 1903, there were 57 lighthouses, many of them built by the Americans. The Spaniards built a cylindrical tower at Capul Island off Samar but its quarters were built during the American period. The parola at Cape Enga&ntilde;o in Santa Ana, Cagayan is one of the most pleasing. Built during the Spanish era, it is an octagonal tower capped by a cylindrical light, around which is a catwalk of wrought iron. The tower is surrounded by three buildings arranged as a &ldquo;C,&rdquo; which share the same wrought iron gate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lighthouses have recently gained attention as heritage sites and as adventure tourist destinations. The lighthouse at Cape Bojeador, Ilocos Norte has undergone restoration. Bricks baked in a kiln found at the slope of the mountain where the lighthouse stands were retrieved for the restoration process.

		"text": "<p>A <strong>retablo</strong> is the Hispanic altar piece of the 16th to the 19th centuries. It is from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>retablo</em>, from the Latin&nbsp;<em>retro</em>, meaning &ldquo;behind,&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>tabula&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>tabulum</em>, referring either to a &ldquo;board,&rdquo; &ldquo;table top,&rdquo; or an &ldquo;altar piece.&rdquo; It is also known by the French term <strong>reredos</strong>. The retablo, which formed a decorative background for the altar table, evolved from medieval painted panels attached as backdrops to the altar. In Spain and her colonies, the retablo evolved into monumental proportions characterized by a fusion of architectural orders, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>, and <strong>relleve</strong> (relief), which could be <strong>bajo relleve</strong> (low relief), <strong>medio relleve</strong> (demi-relief), or <strong>alto relleve</strong> (high relief). The last contains figures sculpted almost in the round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine retablos tend to be more restrained than their counterparts in Spain or Mexico. While the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical</a> orders, the salomonica (twisted column), and the estipite (inverted obelisk) were used, these were often treated more as decorative than as structural elements&mdash;that is, as parts of a larger composition whose foci were the niches containing santos. Both the salom&oacute;nica and est&iacute;pite were popular in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Baroque</a> Spain and the Americas, with the est&iacute;pite more prominent in Latin American <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a> pieces. A retablo was crowned by a fronton (pediment), the most common being the triangular and the broken or open type.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Few retablos in the Philippines are more than 150 years old. Those that may be identified with the 17th or early 18th century are Juan de los Santos&rsquo;s retablo for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, 1617; the side retablos in Maragondon, Cavite; the central retablo formerly in Pangil, Laguna; and the central retablo in Lubao, Pampanga. These early works are characterized by several tiers of niches with santos, and the use of classical rather than baroque ornaments. The loss of early retablos may be attributed to their destruction by fire, typhoons, termites, and dry rot, as well as to enforced demolition or incorporation of parts into later altarpieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the early 18th century, retablo-making in the Philippines was a fully developed art, with master artisans coming from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a> or Santa Cruz, Manila, and from such towns as Paete, Laguna. Retablos of this period are characterized by multiple niches, florid decoration, bright colors, and&nbsp;<em>aleron&nbsp;</em>(decorative flanges) flanking either side of the retablo. These aleron, also called&nbsp;<em>aleta&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>aleton</em>&mdash;from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>ala</em>, meaning &ldquo;wing&rdquo;&mdash;took the form of large volutes, sometimes resembling coiled millipedes that metamorphosed into foliage with cherub putti peering. Wooden surfaces were primed with gesso and then painted. Details were gold-leafed&mdash;a skill in which women were said to be adept.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Excellent 18th-century retablos are those in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2297\">Silang</a>, Cavite, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Basilica Minore del Santo Ni&ntilde;o</a>, in Cebu. In Silang, the main altar combines statuary with high reliefs on the life of Mary. The Santo Ni&ntilde;o retablo contains 17 niches with santos and sprouts flanges at the first and second stories. Its broken pediment is flanked by a pair of diagonal volutes known as the Dientzenhofer motif, named after a family of architects in central Europe. Other outstanding examples of this period are the high altars in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/326\">Magsingal</a>, Ilocos Sur; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/352\">Pakil</a>, Laguna; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/314\">Kawit</a>, Cavite; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/366\">Romblon</a>, Romblon, dated 1724; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Baclayon</a>, Bohol; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/272\">Boljoon</a>, Cebu; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/307\">Guiuan</a>, Eastern Samar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The frenetic decorations of the so-called ultra-baroque that appeared in Spain and especially Latin America in the 18th century hardly sprouted here. The style was also called churrigueresque, after the Churriguera brothers who worked in early 18th century Spain. Toward the 1770s, rococo motifs called&nbsp;<em>rocalla&nbsp;</em>(from&nbsp;<em>roca</em>, meaning &ldquo;rock&rdquo;) began to appear in art and later in retablos. Rococo presented a lighter treatment of decorative elements, its favorite motif being flamelike decorations surrounding assymetrical niches and cartouches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retablos with rocalla elements are found in the sanctuaries of the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\">Tanay</a>, Rizal; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/270\">Betis</a>, Pampanga; Salasa, now Bugallon, Pangasinan; Sinait, Ilocos Sur; San Jacinto, Tuguegarao, Cagayan; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">Argao</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/291\">Dalaguete</a>, Cebu. The side retablos at Pakil, Laguna; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/388\">Tayabas</a>, Quezon; and Tagbilaran, Bohol also display rocalla elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1780, a reaction in Europe against the excesses of rococo gave rise to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Revivalist</a> styles, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a>. The left side altar of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/397\">Vigan Cathedral</a> is a transition piece, with rocalla tendrils straggling in a classicizing format. An early example of the neoclassical is mentioned by Zu&ntilde;iga, who, writing just before 1800, registered his admiration for the retablo of Lipa, Batangas. Artistic change took some time to reach the Philippines where poverty hindered the renovation of many retablos. But a series of devastating earthquakes from 1852 to 1880 damaged many structures, which were then rebuilt following the latest revivalist style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neoclassical retablos are more architectural than sculptural as compared to those of the baroque. They are characterized by the lack of florid ornamentation, a reduced number of niches&mdash;usually a principal one for the church&rsquo;s patron, flanked by two minor ones&mdash;the use of the classical orders in an architectonic rather than decorative manner, and muted colors. To suit the changing tastes of 19th-century Manila, the baroque central retablo in San Agustin was replaced around 1854 by a neoclassical one and was composed of three pairs of massive Corinthian columns flanking a single niche. Other outstanding neoclassical retablos are found in the churches of Vigan, Ilocos Sur; Badoc, Ilocos Norte; Indang, Cavite; San Jose and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">Taal</a>, Batangas; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/280\">Carcar</a>, Cebu; and Jabonga, Agusan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best-known surviving examples of neo-Gothic retablos are those of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/374\">San Sebastian Church</a> in Manila. However, these were not the best, as they were exceeded in size and grandeur by the ruined altars of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo</a> in Intramuros. Other neogothic altars are found in Calbayog, Samar; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/339\">Maribojoc</a>, Bohol; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/344\">Molo</a>, Iloilo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/312\">Jasaan</a>, Misamis Oriental. The church at Oton, Iloilo, unique for its Greek-cross plan, had a magnificent four-sided neogothic retablo resembling the spires of gothic cathedrals in its very center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Churches often had at least three retablos. The <strong>altar mayor</strong> (central or high altar) was the most elaborate. Flanking it were the <strong>colaterales</strong> or <strong>altares menores</strong> (side or smaller retablos). Some churches had many colaterales, eight in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/378\">Santa Maria</a>, Ilocos Sur or even 10 as in San Agustin, Intramuros. Single-niched retablos were also found in the sacristy and the baptistry, the former often enshrining a crucifix and the latter an image of John the Baptist baptizing Jesus. A charming example of the latter is found in the church of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">Morong</a>, Rizal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>altar</strong>, a long narrow table, was attached to the retablo. Flanking the altar were small tables for liturgical vessels called <strong>credencias</strong> (credence tables). At the center of the altar table, raised by about one-third of a meter, was the <strong>tabernaculo</strong> or <strong>sagrario</strong> (tabernacle), sometimes of wood, often of silver plate. A crucifix surmounted the tabernacle, which was flanked by step platforms, either bench-like <strong>gradas</strong> or stairway-like <strong>gradillas</strong>. Arrayed on these were candlesticks&mdash;at least six in number, in many cases 12 or more&mdash;reliquaries, flowers, and <strong>ramilletes</strong> (flowerlike decorations in silver, wood, or even shell).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The retablo of the altar mayor usually had a flight of steps behind it that allowed devotees to come close to the patronal image to kiss it or its vesture. Some churches maintained a <strong>camarin</strong>, a small room or chapel directly behind the main altar where this image could be cleaned or dressed for the next fiesta. An outstanding example of this space is the recently restored Camarin de la Virgen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/376\">Santa Ana Church</a>, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A type of hispanic altarpiece called a <strong>retablo de espejos</strong> is known in the Philippines only through missionary chronicles and in inventories of church property, where an entry is described as&nbsp;<em>embotido de espejos</em>, literally inlaid with mirrors. This type was characterized by niches which had paneled doors, and by surfaces inlaid with tiny pieces of mirror, hence the name. This retablo was built to house precious relics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Retablos were traditionally made of wood, gesso, paint, and gilt until the late 19th century. Later works used brick and mortar, such as those in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/382\">Sarrat</a> (Ilocos Norte) and Leon (Iloilo), or even marble. Early 20th century workshops or&nbsp;<em>talleres&nbsp;</em>like that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3819\">Maximo Vicente</a> made retablos, which were sent to churches all over the Philippines. An example of the understated neoclassical retablo of the Tampinco atelier may be seen in Manaoag, Pangasinan (ca 1909). The retablos in Bacon, Sorsogon, are in the unusual art deco style. Retablos continued to be made well into the 20th century, often employing cement and marble and favoring the baldachin design. After the Second Vatican Council concluded in 1965, retablos fell into disfavor&mdash;some antique ones were torn down in an overeager but unenlightened attempt to implement the decrees of the Council. Santos and retablo parts found their way into antique markets and ended up as decorative elements in private homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting around the 1980s, a popular sentiment set in: modern churches began to commission retablos. These &ldquo;revivalist&rdquo; pieces favored baroque motifs, like those at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/262\">Antipolo Cathedral</a> or Sacred Heart Church in Kamuning, Quezon City. The revival of retablo-making started a new growth among the talleres of Paete, Laguna and Betis, Pampanga. A number of new retablos utilizes molded resin and fiber glass which are then painted to achieve a contrived wood or stone surface. In these pieces, the joyous colors found in authentic pieces have been replaced by the brown and gold used in funeral fittings, giving rise to the term <strong>ataul</strong> (coffin) <strong>baroque</strong> to describe this style. The path broken by such artists as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Locsin</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3376\">Abueva</a> for contemporary inspirational retablo art still has few travelers.&nbsp;<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>rice terraces</strong> are terraced pond fields planted with rice and carved out of the mountains and hills of the Philippine Cordilleras. They are an outstanding example of an evolved, living cultural landscape that can be traced as far back as two millennia ago in precolonial Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inscribed in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">World Heritage (WH) List</a> in 1995 under the official name &ldquo;Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras,&rdquo; the rice terraces are considered to be priceless contributions of the Philippine ancestors to humanity. While terrace-building is known also to the Assam people of northeast India and among the Naga Hills people of Burma, and in Taiwan, Indonesia, and many parts of Southeast Asia, the Philippine rice terraces are perhaps the most extensive in the whole world, occupying unusually high altitudes in the central Cordilleras of the Mountain Province, especially in the Ifugao, Bontoc, and Kalinga areas, and also in some parts of Abra.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Various theories have surfaced regarding the age of these terraces. Henry Otley Beyer, pioneer in Philippine archaeology, found abandoned rice terraces in Benguet. His theory was that the settlers of the area where the rice terraces were subsequently built migrated from the South China-Tonkin area, entered Lingayen Gulf, and then went up the Agno River to establish the terrace culture of northern Luzon. The oldest terraces, found in the highest mountains, according to Beyer, must have been made around 2,000 years ago during the Copper-Bronze Age, while the last ones were built some 500 years ago. This theory, however, does not explain the presence of similar abandoned rice terraces in Majayjay, Laguna and in the provinces of Rizal, Quezon, and even Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anthropologist Felix Keesing and the Belgian missionary and scholar Fr Francis Lambrecht contradicted Beyer&rsquo;s claims, noting that the earliest terraces could not have been built earlier than the Spanish times or ca. 1680, since no written accounts by Spanish chroniclers who visited the area in the 17th century ever mentioned the presence of these terraces. Even <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> folklore does not offer evidence of wet-rice agriculture. This contention is supported by a C-14 radiocarbon dating of artifacts dug out from an excavation in the area, which yielded a date of not earlier than 300 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1964 to 1967, Robert Maher of the University of Michigan took charcoal samples of rice chaff from a house terrace in Banaue, which revealed a C-14 dating of close to 3,000 BP&mdash;or roughly 1,000 years BC&mdash;that could have readily disproved the Keesing-Lambrecht theory. But Maher made it clear that &ldquo;there was no age determination of the rice terrace itself&rdquo; and that the age of the house terrace cannot be held simultaneous with those of the field-terrace sites (Maher 1973).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Terraces, as understood by the Cordillera peoples, could either mean house terraces which are &ldquo;levelled terraced areas for houses, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">granaries</a> and work sites; drained fields which are levelled terraced areas used for the cultivation of dry crops and intended for more permanent forms of terrace use after a few years; or pond fields, which are the levelled irrigated rice terraces&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Perez III</a> et al. 1989). Almost all terraces, however, belong to the pond-field type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>E.P. Patan&ntilde;e (1975) described a typical rice terracing as not simply &ldquo;the levelling of mountainsides into broad steps or embankments but a whole system of engineering built around a network of irrigation canals fed by a mountain spring&rdquo; (39). However, among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> of Abra, terracing is done &ldquo;along rather steep banks of a river into which flow many rivulets. Ditches or canals are cut at almost right angles to the rivulet, and water is carried down to the terraced fields.&rdquo; Furthermore, all rice terraces require the use of a series of retaining walls on different levels, whose purpose is to create level fields suitable for wet-rice growing in wet-rice farming, the walls retaining also the water diverted from the rivers (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2665\">Klassen</a> 1988).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyer (1955) described the process of building these terraces. The terraces were first built of broken stones. As these decayed, they were replaced by round river stones. After the retaining walls were built, they were backfilled with material from the river or from the hillside. Over gravel and sand the builders put some clay to make them waterproof. On top of this lining they placed another layer of sand. Skillfully built irrigation ditches took care of the water supply. Rice terraces may be found in elevations of anywhere from 500 to 1,600 m. The walls themselves rise up to a towering height of 6 m or, in some cases, up to 16 m in varying shapes and slopes, in stone and mud, depending on the terrain and on the capability and taste of the indigenous builders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditionally known as the artists among the Cordillera groups, the Ifugao have fashioned long, massive sloping walls of stone and earth that seem to follow the contour of the mountainsides so that the terraces themselves appear as an enormous sculptural piece. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, on the other hand, have terraces that run in straight lines with almost vertical stone faces intended to maximize the level area for planting. Such a strictly architectural and functional approach to form may partly be explained by some references to Bontok culture&mdash;the Bontok being known for their reverence to the gods, their courage, resourcefulness, patience, industry, and physical endurance. The courageous and warlike <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, in contrast to the Ifugao and the Bontok, have low stone walls supporting inward sloping earth walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patan&ntilde;e (1978) described the mode of planting on these rice terraces. When the wet season comes, the seedbeds are sown, the water is then channeled in the terraces, and the soil becomes soggy. The men line up in the field and stab sticks into the soil to allow the water to seep in, all the while chanting songs. Manure from the pigpens is brought up and the soil tramped upon and puddled into a soft ooze. Then the women appear with rice seedlings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Water is steadily fed into the terraces and when the plants begin to grow, the sickly ones are promptly pulled out and the plots are kept free of weeds. As the rice plants mature, bamboo &ldquo;birds&rdquo; are hung from poles to keep away the greedy rice birds. The home of the terrace owner becomes taboo at harvest time. Only immediate friends and helpers are permitted to enter the terrace. A small fire is built and offerings and prayers made to the spirits of the fields before the ripened grains are plucked. While the harvesting is in progress, visitors are not allowed to approach the field. The work is done by hand, and the stalks with the grain are bundled up and left to dry in the sun. Before the grain is finally stored, a priest invokes the blessing of the high deity Lumauig so that the rice might last a very long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras World Heritage property is the first recognized organically evolving cultural landscape. Five of the most intact and impressive rice terraces were identified as priority sites during inscription. These are found in the Province of Ifugao in the heritage cluster sites of Nagacadan in the municipality of Kiangan; Batad and Bangaan in the municipality of Banaue; Central Mayoyao cluster in the municipality of Mayoyao; and Hungduan terrace cluster in the municipality of Hungduan. These five Ifugao sites are of unparalled beauty, having special unique features: the Nagacadan terrace cluster in Kiangan is composed of two distinct ascending rows of terraces that are bisected by a river; the Hungduan terrace cluster uniquely emerges into a spider web; the central Mayoyao terrace cluster is interspersed with traditional farmers&rsquo; <strong>bale/fale</strong> (house) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>alang</strong></a> (granary); the Bangaan terrace cluster serves as backdrop of a typical Ifugao <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">traditional village</a>; and the Batad terrace cluster is nestled in an amphitheatre-like semi-circule of terraces with a village at its base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rice terraces signify the identity and ingenuity of the Philippine Cordillera cultural groups and represent the physical, sociocultural, economic, political and religious mindset of a resilient people who have survived life in a rugged natural environment. It exemplifies a complex elaborate farming system of high to medium altitude irrigated rice agriculture that is unique in the world. Interlaced with the terraced pond fields of stone or mud walls are intricate irrigation systems with their accompanying watersheds&mdash;the <strong>ala</strong> or <strong>inalahan</strong> (communal) and the <strong>muyong</strong> (privately owned forests)&mdash;which exhibit skilled engineering management that is appreciated to the present. The terraces&rsquo; walls similarly act as pathways and within paddies are earth mounds planted with vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rice terraces likewise illustrate the persistence of cultural traditions and the remarkable continuity and endurance of an agricultural and ecological system that reflect a cooperative regimen of work sharing by the whole community that is based on a mastery of the rich diversity of the natural environment within the Philippine Cordillera. Community-based zoning, building, and land use characterize this ecosystem. Moreover, the building and maintenance of these rice terraces are administered by mutual help teams in every community, with no complex institutionalized arrangements to oversee the continuous operation of the terraces. In maintaining these terraces, annual and lunar cycles and traditional pest control practices that are based on the processing of a variety of local herbs are used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significantly associated with the rice terraces are the <strong>boble</strong> or <strong>babloy</strong> (traditional settlements), and an architecture that has equally provided a sense of identity to the community and country. The Ifugao house called <strong>bale</strong> or <strong>fale</strong> is a reflection of architectural ingenuity. They are built in clusters on paved plots called <strong>dola</strong> or <strong>chola</strong> (house terrace). A modest four-walled structure, the Ifugao house is elevated from the ground by <strong>tukud</strong> or <strong>tuud</strong> (four posts) with <strong>lidi</strong>, <strong>libong</strong>, or <strong>halipan </strong> (rat proof disks) on the ends. Other noteworthy traditional architecture of the Philippine Cordilleras is the <strong>binayon</strong> or <strong>finaryon</strong> of the Kalinga, the <strong>fay-u</strong> of the Bontok, the <strong>Sagada house</strong>, the <strong>binuron</strong> of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a>, the house of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, and the <strong>binangiyan</strong>, <strong>apa</strong>,and <strong>allao</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a>. They all come in different forms, but all are of wood and thatch roof, and are graced with bamboo or reeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in the lowlands, animism, associated with polytheism and ancestor worship, pervades the whole tone and process of rice production in these upland farming areas. Spirits are believed to abound everywhere&mdash;in the ricefields, river, hill, or mountain&mdash;and must be appeased by the regular performance of rituals and sacrifices guided by the spiritual leaders of these mountain peoples. Needless to say, the sense of community is heightened with these periodic ceremonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the rice terraces, therefore, are a vast array of cultural traditions such as the planting and harvest rituals; the chants recited during harvest season, sickness, and death; the numerous ceremonies representing life and love; the customs that relate to birth, courtship, marriage, death; and the routinary practices of the everyday life of the people. Altogether, these have remarkably been sustained to the present, demonstrating the solidity of a culture that has evolved through time and through generations of practice.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

		"text": "<p>A <strong>sabungan</strong> &mdash;from the Tagalog&nbsp;<em>sabong</em>, meaning cockfight, and&nbsp;<em>an</em>, a suffix denoting place&mdash;or <strong>cockpit</strong> is the building where cockfights are held. It is sometimes called a <strong>coliseum</strong>, <strong>sports center</strong>, or <strong>gallera</strong>, which is from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>gallo</em>, meaning &ldquo;chicken.&rdquo; It is one of the landmarks of a town, as well known as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\">town hall</a>, the plaza, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">market</a>, since cockfights take place regularly on weekends and on holidays, and are attended religiously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its location varies. It could be in a busy section of the town, particularly if it is an old cockpit. New cockpits are usually built outside the town proper, on spacious grounds which can be occupied by food stalls and used for parking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building plan could be square, octagonal, or circular. The <strong>rueda</strong> (arena) is the center of the structure. Square in shape, it has a dirt floor to better absorb blood and is enclosed by a fence or grille with gates for access. Around the pit rise the seats for spectators in amphitheater fashion. The lower section of ringside is for heavy bettors; the <strong>galeria</strong> or upper section is for ordinary bettors and spectators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the cockpit is an enclosure which serves both as the entrance area and as the <strong>ulutan</strong>, a gallery where cocks are matched prior to actual combat.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The roof may be square, octagonal, or circular in plan, depending on the floor plan. Over a square cockpit, the roof may be hipped or gabled. Over the octagonal or circular plan, the roof may be conical, somewhat like a salakot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For maximum ventilation, the building which consists of the structural frame and the platforms for seats, has no sidings. The sabungan of this type looks light and transparent and is in fact quite airy. On the other hand, the sabungan may be enclosed by wooden sidings and provided with windows or with wooden louvers or jalousies. Some cockpits are completely enclosed and air-conditioned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines, cockfights were being staged prior to the coming of the Spaniards. In 1521, Magellan&rsquo;s chronicler Pigafetta recorded the cockfights he saw in the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish permitted or at least tolerated cockfights because the government earned revenues from taxes and fees collected from the sabungan. Descriptions of cockfights and the&nbsp;<em>sabungero&nbsp;</em>(cock owner) and trainer appear in literature, notably in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s novel <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Touch Me Not) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong><em><strong><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Subversion). In his essay <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1665\">&ldquo;Sobre la Indolencia de los Filipinos&rdquo;</a> (On the Indolence of the Filipinos), Rizal noted that cockfighting was a sport that antedated the arrival of the Spaniards, but its institutionalization as a form of gambling happened during the Spanish colonial period, as evidenced by the fact that all terms relating to gambling in cockfighting are derived from the Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">Prints</a> from the 19th century show various types of cockpits. There were the temporary open-air pits consisting mainly of an area enclosed by a bamboo fence. There were the more permanent types, which had a fence, circular fighting arena, surrounded by a narrow, slightly sloping gallery for spectators, with the entire area covered by a conical roof resting on slender posts. Another type has an elevated square arena surrounded by a ground-level gallery and an elevated balcony for spectators. The whole area was enclosed with walls of bamboo and covered by a roof of cogon grass with push-out windows for illumination and ventilation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the Spanish period, cockpits have been used for political meetings and theatrical performances because the arena is visible from all seats and is spacious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Americans&rsquo; puritanical ethos frowned on all types of gambling, cockfights continued into the American era. There seems to have been no bans on cockfights although laws regulated it. An indication that cockfights were allowed is the La Loma Arena, in Quezon City which is still running. Remodelled, rebuilt, and upgraded a number of times, this arena is considered Manila&rsquo;s oldest, and its establishment can be traced to the year 1902.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past decades, cockfighting aficionados in the Philippines established several cockpit arenas in Metro Manila such as the Pasay Cockpit Arena in Pasay, Elorde Cockpit Arena in Para&ntilde;aque, Zapote Cockpit Arena in Las Pi&ntilde;as, AP Recreational Area in Makati, Pasig Square Garden in Pasig, Mandaluyong Cockpit Arena in Mandaluyong, Northbay Cockpit Arena in Navotas, Potrero Cockpit Arena in Malabon, and Marikina Valley Cockpit Arena in Marikina. Occasional cockfights are held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\">Araneta Coliseum</a> in Quezon City, ULTRA Cockpit in Pasig, and San Juan Coliseum in San Juan. Cockfights held in large venues not solely dedicated to cockfighting are called&nbsp;<em>pintakasi&nbsp;</em>(derbies), which attract a large audience because elite and well-known fighting cocks, their handlers, and sponsors participate in these events. Large sums are allegedly exchanged in these fights. Derbies have even attracted foreign participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>High-end cockfighting arenas are also situated in the provinces. Some of the arenas are air-conditioned and may be privately or publicly owned. Examples of these high-end arenas are Paniqui Provincial Cockpit in Tarlac, Iloilo Coliseum in Jaro, Iloilo, and the New Gallera de Mandaue Cockpit in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gambling has always been part of cockfighting. Wagers can go up into thousands of pesos, especially in the pintakasi where fighting cocks belonging to the rich are pitted against each other. The cockpit has a well-known figure called&nbsp;<em>kristo</em>, because with his arms outstretched like Christ on the cross, he takes bets from spectators while signaling the odds of each&nbsp;<em>tupada&nbsp;</em>(fight). The kristo are noted for their phenomenal memory. They can remember who made the bet, how much the bet was, and on which fighting cock a bet has been placed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because gambling is involved, government regulates cockfighting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presidential Decree (PD) 449 of 9 May 1974, known as the Cockfighting Law of 1974, regulates the construction of cockpits. Section 5 restricts ownership, operation, and management to Filipino citizens. Only one cockpit is allowed in each city or municipality, unless the population is over 100,000, in which case two cockpits may be opened. Cockpits must follow local zoning laws and are allowed to operate on Sundays and local fiestas, but operation is limited to three days. The PD was amended five times by Marcos, with the last amendment in 1981, PD 1802-A, creating the Philippine Gamefowl Commission. Despite regulations, there are unauthorized fights held clandestinely, requiring police action.&nbsp;<strong><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>sementeryo</strong>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>cementerio</em>, is a <strong>cemetery</strong> or <strong>memorial park</strong> &mdash;that is, a place for burying the dead. It is also known as <strong>kampo santo</strong>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>campo</em>, meaning &ldquo;a tract of flat and even land,&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>santo</em>, meaning &ldquo;holy&rdquo;; <strong>pantyon</strong>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>panteon</em>, &ldquo;a funeral monument&rdquo;; and <strong>libingan</strong>, from the Tagalog&nbsp;<em>libing</em>, to bury, and&nbsp;<em>an</em>, a suffix denoting place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The practice of burying the dead with special honors and in a special place is an ancient one, as attested to not only by the numerous burial grounds excavated throughout the Philippines but by the persistence of ancient burial practices among the enthnolinguistic communities of the Philippines. Excavations indicate that ancient Filipinos had elaborate rites for their dead and buried them with material goods such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">tradeware</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">gold</a>, and other ornaments such as the ones in Manila, particularly Lamayan St, Santa Ana; along the banks of Laguna de Bay, especially in Pila, Laguna; Iloilo in the Visayas; and Butuan in Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Distinction must be made between primary and secondary burial: the first happens immediately after a person dies, and the second when the corpse is exhumed after a few months or years and the bones are interred or kept in some place of honor. For both primary and secondary burials, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">earthen or limestone jars</a> were used. In some cases, the corpse was buried in a wooden coffin first, then the remains were kept in a jar. An outstanding example of a secondary burial earthen jar is the Manunggul jar found in Palawan. Earthen jars could be plain oversized pots with covers, or they could be decorated with light-colored slip, burnished or incised. Some earthen burial jars had zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures molded on their covers, like the jars found in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2224\">Maitum</a>, Sarangani. Limestone burial jars found in Mindanao have flat sides and are incised with chevrons. Other burial jars are shaped as caskets or are zoomorphic.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Don Alonso Martin Quirante, sent by Gov-Gen Fajardo to conquer the Igorots, describes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a> burial practices ca 1624: for many days prior to interment, often more than a month, the community gathers to feast around the corpse until it is fully desiccated, after which the body is wrapped in a blanket with provisions of&nbsp;<em>buyo&nbsp;</em>(betel nut) and other things given the corpse, then buried inside <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/233\">caves</a> or placed on trees. The Dominican Francisco Antolin, writing in 1789, reports that the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> inter their dead under the house, within the house or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">granary</a>, or in a cemetery outside the village as in the case of Tonglo, or in mountainside caves. The dead are buried with as many as 20 expensive blankets and even <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">personal ornaments</a> or jewelry. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, like the Tinguian, take part in lengthy feasts. The Ifugao, desiccate the corpse by salting and smoking with pine fires. After about four months, the bones are interred in one corner of the granary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The practice of burying in caves persists today in the Cordilleras. The cave cemeteries of Sagada contain hundreds of mummified corpses, in some cases in wooden coffins. Today the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> (Badjao) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> bury their dead on isolated islands. The southern Sama Dilaut&rsquo;s traditional burial grounds are the islands of Bilatan Boon and Bunabunaan, Tawi-Tawi. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/14/2086#craving\">Grave markers</a> are carved with birds, sea horses, and serpents. Grave plots are adorned with canopies, colored paper parasols, and buntings. The Sama graves are marked with abstract sculptures that indicate the gender of the deceased and his or her status in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spaniards did not find it difficult to convince the Filipinos of an afterlife. The Filipino practice of burying the dead with respect jibed squarely with the Christian respect for the dead in view of a future resurrection. Until the 19th century, it was the practice to bury dead Christians within the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> grounds. Ecclesiastical and civil dignitaries were often buried within the church and in larger churches or cathedrals in a crypt below the sanctuary. Others were buried in an area on one side of the nave. In Europe, this was often the north side of the church, but the practice was not uniformly followed in the Philippines. Grave sites were marked by a&nbsp;<em>lapida&nbsp;</em>(stone slab), usually of marble, inscribed with the name of the deceased and the dates of birth and death. For secondary burial, the bones of the deceased were transferred to the church nave, where they were buried in the walls or in the floor of the church, appropriately marked by a stone slab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the 19th century, greater awareness of the spread of disease and a series of epidemics caused the cemeteries to be transferred outside the town boundaries often a kilometer or two away. These cemeteries were called campo santo. Ideally, the campo santo had a <strong>capilla</strong> (mortuary chapel) at its center and walls demarcating its boundaries. Within the walls were stone <strong>nichos</strong> (vaults) placed one on top of the other, where the dead, enclosed in a&nbsp;<em>kabaong&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>ataul&nbsp;</em>(coffin) were buried. The lapida sealed the nicho. The nicho was sometimes found along the perimeter wall; hence, the wall not only enclosed the cemetery but also served as a burial site. As a nicho was paid for by private individuals or rented from the church, the poor often could not afford such luxury and so for a pauper&rsquo;s burial, a 2-meter-deep ditch was used. After about five years, secondary burial took place. For secondary burial, a place called <strong>osario</strong>, from the Latin&nbsp;<em>ossa</em>, meaning &ldquo;bones,&rdquo; was built. Wealthy individuals could have a special niche for their dead, while the poor or those remains which could not be identified were interred in a common niche.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The practice of secondary burial inside a church continued up to the 20th century when wealthy benefactors and other dignitaries were given a special place of honor on the church floor or wall, as seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a>. Another special place in the campo santo was the <strong>angelito</strong> (little angel), the burial site for baptized children who died before the age of reason which is seven. Catholic teaching indicated that such children went straight to heaven, rewarded for their unsullied innocence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campo santo was considered a consecrated ground, and those who were known as public sinners could not be buried in it. With the establishment of Masonry and churches other than the Catholic, the list of those who could not be buried in the campo santo increased. In response to the Catholic Church stand, Masons and Aglipayans took to building their own cemeteries, often right beside the Catholic, as in Cagayan de Oro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many towns, the cemetery was a flat space enclosed by a flimsy bamboo fence or thickets of the&nbsp;<em>madre de cacao&nbsp;</em>tree. But in more prosperous places, the cemetery was a well-designed space. An early example of this is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/350\">Paco Cemetery</a>, built in 1823 as a burial site for victims of cholera. Two concentric walls enclose an open space divided into quadrants by spacious walkways. One walkway leads from the main entrance to the elliptical mortuary chapel and is covered by a stone vault. Behind the chapel are the angelito and osario. Outside Manila, outstanding cemeteries were built in Santa Maria and Vigan, Ilocos Sur; Nagcarlan, Laguna; Tabaco, Albay; San Joaquin and Janiuay, Iloilo; and Boljoon, Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cemetery of Santa Maria, Ilocos Sur is at the foot of the hill where the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/378\">church</a> is built. The mortuary chapel within the cemetery is capped by a short bell tower. The outstanding feature of the Vigan Cemetery is the <strong>espada&ntilde;a</strong> (bell turret) over the gate of the cemetery. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/347\">Nagcarlan Cemetery</a>, built by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2637\">Fr Vicente Belloc, OFM</a>, is a brick structure. The mortuary chapel, located at the rear, is flanked by walls that curve out to enclose a circular space. Beside the chapel are the walls containing niches, and at the sides and front, the walls are pierced by arches. Inside the chapel, steps lead down to a crypt. The Tabaco Cemetery made of cut lava blocks has a handsome chapel with a hemispherical stone dome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The San Joaquin, Iloilo cemetery has a low front section from where a grand flight of steps leads to the main elevated section dominated by an octagonal mortuary chapel with a towering dome. The Janiuay Cemetery, like San Joaquin, is elevated. Three front entrances, at the middle and sides, are impressive for their stairways and gothic arches. The cemetery chapel, now in ruins, was originally in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Gothic</a> style. The gate of the Boljoon Cemetery is decorated by low reliefs of demons and symbols of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toward the end of the Spanish period, the Archdiocese of Manila opened <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/315\">La Loma Cemetery</a> at the outskirts of Manila. This cemetery, surrounded by a wall and entered through an elaborate wrought iron gate, has a full-sized church. Plots were laid out in orderly fashion for niches and mausoleums. The apportioning of public lands for cemeteries continued into the American period. The North and South Cemeteries were built for the inhabitants of Manila and its environs. Other municipal cemeteries were created. Many, however, were built after the American regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cemeteries spawned a whole industry catering to the need for aesthetically pleasing burial sites. Prominent architects were employed by the rich to build mausoleums for their departed. These structures resembling small buildings could contain living quarters that are used on 1 Nov, All Saints Day, the day traditionally set for commemorating the dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mausoleums range from the Egyptian style to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neogothic</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassic</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">modern</a>. Those in the Chinese Cemetery, which is adjacent to the North Cemetery and La Loma, draw from Chinese architecture. Ranking below the mausoleums are the nichos, often surmounted by a cross or by saints and angels. Other ornaments used in cemeteries are skulls, skeletons, laurel wreaths, lilies, and a tree or post cut in half or hourglasses with wings to symbolize the unexpectedness of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of World War II, American and Filipino casualties were buried in special cemeteries. The American battle monuments in Makati and the Libingan ng mga Bayani are examples of such special cemeteries. The American Cemetery might be considered an early example of the memorial park that rose in popularity during the late 1960s. The American Cemetery has wide lawns planted with trees and flowers that were carefully chosen so that there is always one in bloom every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Patterned after memorial parks in the United States, the local memorial parks promise perpetual care for the grave of a loved one. Extensive landscaped grounds are properly zoned so that mausoleums occupy a particular area and nichos another, and wide tracts of green lawns cover burial vaults below ground level. A chapel, administration building, facilities, and free-standing sculpture complete the memorial park. The first memorial park to be opened was the Manila Memorial Park in Para&ntilde;aque. Memorial parks have been built in many places outside Manila, their popularity stemming in part from the overcrowding and filth of the older cemeteries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reforms in Catholic liturgy, begun in the 1970s in response to the directives of Vatican II and concluded in 1965, led to the growing acceptance of cremation as a form of burial. Catholic rules stated that as long as cremation is not done to desecrate the body or to deny the resurrection of the body, which is considered sacred, cremation is allowed. The Catholic Church came up with a rite of burial for cremated remains. This development catalyzed the popularity of the columbarium or columbary, a place to keep cremated remains. Parish churches and cathedrals were quick to build columbariums or columbaria for the convenience of parishioners who now did not have to travel far to visit the grave of a relative, and for the economic benefits they brought in to the parish. Some early columbariums were built by Mount Carmel Parish in Quezon City and San Antonio Parish in Forbes Park. Memorial Park companies, funeral parlors, and municipal governments soon added to the number of columbariums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Columbariums are either indoor, meaning in a crypt in a basement or in the premises of the church, or outdoor, meaning in a garden or open space in the premises of the church. Columbariums have single or family niches for the remains. Quite popular is the family niche about 50 cm wide, deep and tall, with a capacity for four urns. With the increasing popularity of cremations, funeral parlors have built their own crematoriums. The columbariums have also spread to the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Columbariums pose hardly any health hazards as the remains interred in them pass through fire. The Housing and Land Use Regulatory Board has placed the easement between a planned columbarium and a residential area at five meters.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

It may also be called by the Spanish name, <strong>iglesia,</strong> or, in English, &ldquo;church.&rdquo; The simbahan is an enclosed place where a congregation gathers for worship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Catholic Churches</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These structures of stone and wood are landmarks of colonial architecture. Centrally located at an area right in front of the plaza, they continue to be the most prominent building in many towns. Many lowland Philippine towns have grown around the church-plaza complex. This did not happen by accident but rather by deliberate planning of the colonial government in conformity with the Ordenanzas of 1573 promulgated by the Spanish crown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Churches may be classified according to the material used. They may be of <strong>ligero</strong> (light) construction, hence impermanent, or of durable construction. The former employed such materials as <strong>tabla</strong> (wood planks), <strong>ca&ntilde;a y nipa</strong> (bamboo and thatch), <strong>carrizo</strong> (reed or bamboo). Those of durable construction employed stone and were classified as <strong>de sillar</strong>, or made from cut stones; <strong>de&nbsp;</strong><strong>mamposteria</strong>, or rubble; <strong>de cota,</strong> or from old stones used in previous constructions; <strong>de ladrillo</strong>, or brick; and <strong>de tabique</strong>, or of wattle and daub. <strong>De harigue</strong> was a variety that employed a colonnade of tree trunks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Churches may also be classified according to function. The <strong>catedral</strong> was the church at the seat of a diocese. The <strong>capillas</strong> were the smaller churches, such as those in convents of nuns, colleges, or cemeteries. A capilla is ordinarily an independent structure built beside the convent or another building, but in some cases it is a room in a building. <strong>Basilica&nbsp;</strong><strong>minore</strong> was the honorific title given to a few churches, to distinguish them from the basilicas of Rome, which are exclusively called <strong>basilica majore</strong>. There are 15 basilica minore in the Philippines, and their dates of elevation are as follows: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/374\">San Sebastian</a>, Manila, first to be elevated to basilica in 1890; Inmaculada Concepcion, Batangas City, 13 Feb 1948; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">San Martin de Tours</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Taal</a>, Batangas, 22 Oct 1948; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Santo Ni&ntilde;o</a>, Cebu City, 1 Apr 1965 on the 400th anniversary of the Christianization of the Philippines; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral of the Inmaculada Concepcion</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, Manila, 27 Apr 1981; Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Caridad, Agoo, La Union, 15 Jul 1982; Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Pe&ntilde;afrancia, Naga, 2 May 1985; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/388\">San Miguel Arcangel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/428\">Tayabas</a>, Quezon, 11 Oct 1988; Jesus Nazareno, Quiapo, 11 Dec 1987; San Lorenzo Ruiz aka Binondo Church, Manila, 23 Jul 1992; Our Lady of Piat, Piat, Cagayan, 10 Mar 1997; Inmaculada Concepcion, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a>, Bulacan, 9 Apr 1999;&nbsp;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario, Manaoag, Pangasinan, 11 Oct 2014; and Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Quezon City&nbsp;and San Juan Bautista, Badoc, Ilocos Norte, 30 Nov 2018.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Basilica&rdquo; originally referred to the churches patterned after the law courts of ancient Rome, characterized by a long nave, flanked by arcades and terminating in a semicircular apse, like the Lateran and St. Paul Basilicas in Rome. By extension it referred to any church noted for its antiquity or for its spiritual significance. Some Philippine churches are basilical in plan, like the Manila Cathedral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plans and parts.</strong> The Council of Trent&rsquo;s liturgical reform dictated the shape and form of the typical colonial church. The council fostered frequent and sometimes simultaneous celebration of the Eucharist, restored preaching to its central role as a vehicle of reform and instruction, encouraged devotion to the Eucharist and frequent confession, and emphasized the distinction between priest and clergy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical church of the colonial period reflected these reforming tendencies and had two focal points: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>altar mayor</strong></a> (main altar), where the Eucharist was celebrated and the consecrated host kept in the <strong>sagrario</strong> (tabernacle); and the <strong>pulpito</strong> (pulpit), placed at the crossing of nave and transept in the <strong>crucero</strong> (cruciform plan)&mdash;i.e., a plan shaped like a cross&mdash;or at the nave so as to enhance audibility of the sermon. Because of the strict Eucharistic fast starting at midnight, the Mass was celebrated early in the morning. Thus, when a church had several priests, they celebrated Mass at about the same time at different altars, hence the <strong>altares menores</strong> (side altars).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In front of the church was the plaza, <strong>atrio</strong>, or patio, which was a wide empty space that made it possible to view the church facade in all its grandeur. Facade styles depended on what was in vogue at the time of construction and on the preferences of the <strong>cura</strong> or parish priest. Facade styles and ornaments included the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassic</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Gothic</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neo-Romanesque</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>campanario</strong> (from Spanish&nbsp;<em>campana</em>, &ldquo;bell,&rdquo; derived from Latin&nbsp;<em>campana</em>, from Campania, a southern Italian region whose metal was used for bells) was the bell tower, a tall structure at the top of which hung the bells. Most churches have one bell tower. A good number have two, and a few have three. In the Philippines these towers range from simple wooden structures to massive stone monuments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The campanario was an important part of the church complex. Aside from calling the people to Mass and tolling the hours, its bells heralded the coming of important personages, warned of fires and enemy raids, and announced significant events in the parish, such as fiestas, weddings, and deaths. The towers served as lookouts. It is said that along the coasts of Ilocos, Bicol, and other areas, flares were lit up from one belfry to another to warn the next town of impending danger. Because they towered above the trees, they were probably used as landmarks by travelers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although most campanarios adjoined the facade, a few parishes adopted other arrangements. The one in Marilao, Bulacan, for example, juts out just behind, not to the side of the facade. In Padre Garcia, Batangas, the tower adjoins the church but stands a little distance behind the line of the facade. In Cebu, the Cathedral and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">church in Argao</a> each have a solitary tower that is connected to the main building by a small covered passageway, called a <strong>camarin de los campaneros</strong> (bellringers&rsquo; quarters). This might have been used for a variety of purposes. The Manila Cathedral in the 18th century utilized the same arrangement, but this housed the <strong>Sala Capitular</strong> or Chapter Hall. In Meycauayan, Bulacan, and Milaor, Camarines Sur, a large archway linked the bell tower and the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Detached bell towers are characteristic of Ilocos churches. It is conjectured that the tower was constructed far enough from the church so that, should it topple during an earthquake, the church would be safe from falling debris. Thus, in the parishes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/317\">Laoag</a>, Ilocos Norte, and Bantay, Ilocos Sur, a little hike is needed to get to the bell tower. Outside Ilocos, detached bell towers are quite rare, found only in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/311\">Jaro</a>, Iloilo, and in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Baclayon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/422\">Loay</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/322\">Loboc</a> in Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bell towers have generally either four or eight sides, the quadrilateral form being the earlier of the two. Many consist of four-sided bases topped by octagonal <strong>cuerpos</strong> (stories or levels). The campanario in Badoc, Ilocos Norte, has six sides. The magnificent tower in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/393\">Tumauini</a>, Isabela, is cylindrical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towers were usually crowned by a <strong>chapitel</strong> or small dome, occasionally referred to as a <strong>bonete</strong>. Atop the chapitel was perched a wooden or wrought-iron cross, sometimes ornamented with a <strong>velete</strong> (weather vane). In the late 19th century, it became the trend to install <strong>pararayos</strong> (lightning rods).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>espada&ntilde;a</strong> (from Spanish&nbsp;<em>espada&ntilde;ar</em>, &ldquo;to spread the tail feathers,&rdquo; derived from Latin&nbsp;<em>spadix</em>, &ldquo;shoot of the palm tree&rdquo;) was rarely used for church facades. This was a belfry composed of a thick wall, pierced with windows from which the bells were hung.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of belfry did not suit local conditions, because it could topple during an earthquake and damage the facade and choir loft; thus, only a few such structures were erected. The largest one, found over the entrance to the cemetery chapel in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, Ilocos Sur, has openings for four bells. A massive one in Buguey, Cagayan, houses two bells. Its base is quadrilateral and seems to have been intended for a polygonal structure rather than an espada&ntilde;a. Smaller variants with openings for 1 to 2 bells can be seen in the cemetery chapel in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/347\">Nagcarlan</a>, Laguna; the Ermita de San Jacinto in Tuguegarao, Cagayan; and the parish churches of Basco, Mahatao, and Sabtang in Batanes. Over the pediment of the church of Puncan, Nueva Ecija, is an espada&ntilde;a, unusual for its top-heavy appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the rest of the church building, bell towers were adapted to the peculiar seismic conditions of the country. They were far from being soaring and airy, for they had to be squat, thick, and massive. To ensure stability, each upper story was smaller than the lower. Good examples of this form are those in Cabugao, Ilocos Sur, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao</a>, Iloilo. Buttresses support the nave and transept walls. In Spanish colonial times, the buttress was known as a <strong>contrafuerte</strong> (from Spanish&nbsp;<em>contra</em>, &ldquo;counter to,&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>fuerte</em>, &ldquo;fort&rdquo;). Other local terms were <strong>estribo</strong> (Spanish from Old German&nbsp;<em>streban</em>, &ldquo;to hold up&rdquo;) and <strong>machon</strong>, (from Spanish&nbsp;<em>macho</em>, derived from Latin&nbsp;<em>masculus</em>, &ldquo;male&rdquo;). To withstand earthquakes, colonial stone buildings had massive <strong>pader</strong> (from Spanish&nbsp;<em>paredes</em>, &ldquo;walls&rdquo;), some almost 2 m thick. It seems that no cost was too great to secure the strength of these walls. Buttresses of all shapes, sizes, and thickness employed particularly in churches, account for the peculiar character of Philippine colonial architecture. Some of the bulkiest buttresses are those in the church of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/328\">Majayjay</a> in Laguna, the Cathedral of Naga in Camarines Sur, and the redoubtable church of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/355\">Paoay</a> in Ilocos Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The size or number of buttresses is not a measure of the great age of a building. There are many examples of early buildings being propped up later by buttresses. There is some indication that a number of 17th-century churches without buttresses were sound enough to resist earthquakes. On the other hand, 19th-century structures, such as the church of Las Pi&ntilde;as and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/315\">La Loma Cemetery chapel</a>, have oversized buttresses. To be sure, buttresses carried no lifetime guarantee that a wall would be temblor-proof. In 1983 a strong earthquake damaged several churches in Ilocos Norte, a province known for its formidable buttresses. Badoc church lost a sizeable amount of masonry, and many of its bulbous contrafuertes were reduced to half. On 15 Oct 2013 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2 severely damaged a number of historic churches in Bohol and Cebu, and completely destroyed two of the oldest churches in Bohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stepped buttresses, which are huge stairways leading right up to roof level, are found in many Ilocos churches, although they may also be seen in churches across the Cordilleras, in Tuguegarao, Cagayan, and in Basco, Batanes. Their precise function has not yet been established, although some hypothesize it was to aid in roof maintenance, such as replacing the thatch covering and discarding broken roof tiles. A variant of the stepped buttress is the sawtooth buttress found in the church at Iguig, Cagayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The buttresses of Paoay, Badoc, and Laoag, all in Ilocos Norte, are remarkable for their awesome volutes and curves. In Pangasinan, particularly in the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/274\">Calasiao</a> and San Carlos, the buttresses appear to be half-hearted attempts and scarcely reach half the height of the walls, although they rest on inordinately large pedestals. Arched or &ldquo;flying&rdquo; buttresses are exceedingly rare and can only be seen in such churches as Iguig and Santo Domingo in Piat, Cagayan, and Tumauini, Isabela, where they support the apses, or in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/397\">Vigan Cathedral</a>, Ilocos Sur, where a series of ungainly mini-&ldquo;flying&rdquo; buttresses link the upper portion of the clerestory of the nave with the lower roofline of the aisles.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowning glory of any church is the <strong>cimborio</strong> (Spanish, from Latin&nbsp;<em>cymbium</em>, &ldquo;a vase or cup&rdquo;), also known as <strong>cupola</strong> (Spanish, from Arabic&nbsp;<em>cubba</em>, &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo;), <strong>media naranja</strong> (Spanish, &ldquo;half orange&rdquo;), <strong>naranjado</strong> (hispanism, &ldquo;orange-shaped&rdquo;), and &ldquo;dome&rdquo; (from Latin&nbsp;<em>domus</em>, &ldquo;house&rdquo;). It is a hemispherical roof, constructed over the crossing of the transept and the nave and, like the bell tower, is visible from a great distance. If there is no transept, it is erected near or above the main altar. The dome rests on a cylinder, the drum, which is of the same diameter. It is sometimes topped by a <strong>linterna </strong> (lantern), a small cylindrical or octagonal tower crowned by a smaller dome. The dome is often mentioned in records as &ldquo;media naranja&rdquo; because it resembles a halved orange. The media naranja dome was the most popular type and was used in the churches of Pampanga, Batangas, and Iloilo, the majority of which were built by the Augustinians in the late 19th century. The dome of the church in Santa Lucia, Ilocos Sur, is the only one in the Ilocos region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of domes, crossing towers in the shape of octagonal pyramids were used in some Laguna churches and in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">Taal Basilica</a> in Batangas. The four-sided cimborio was a type fairly used in the Philippines but not commonly seen in Spanish or Latin American churches, although some examples are found in Peru. Such a crossing tower was utilized in some churches in Bohol, Pangasinan, Laguna, Rizal, and other provinces. This may have evolved as a solution to a leaking media naranja, as when it was decided to cover the defective dome of the Manila Cathedral in 1768 with a pyramidal tile roof resting on four walls (Diaz-Trechuelo 1959, 265).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ceiling under the dome or crossing tower was usually hemispherical. An inner gallery running throughout its circumference was popularly called <strong>langit-langitan</strong> (little heaven). It was approached through a catwalk that ran between the ceiling and roof of the nave. From the gallery, banners and other decorations were hung.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dome rested on four pendentives, triangular-shaped concave walls between the supporting pillars and the base of the dome. These pendentives were visible inside the church and were traditionally adorned with the portraits of the four evangelists. The entrance of the church was usually a single portal, sometimes flanked by niches. In some churches the main portal was flanked by side doors. A large door almost always had a <strong>postigo</strong> or smaller door cut into it. This was the customary entrance to the church, as the main door was opened only on important occasions, such as town fiestas. Aside from the front portal, there was a side portal leading to the nave. Some churches had additional portals at the transept. In Franciscan churches, notably those in Laguna, a side door that led to the street was ornamented, but the one leading to the cloister was not. This ornamented gate was called Portiuncula, after the chapel that San Francisco de Asis repaired in Italy and is now within the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Angels in Assisi. It was customary to use this gate for Saturday processions of the Virgin. The gate was given the name because anyone who joined the procession and used that gate received the same indulgence given to those who visit the Basilica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>coro</strong> (Spanish, derived from Greek&nbsp;<em>choragos</em>, then Latin,&nbsp;<em>chorus</em>, &ldquo;a band of singers&rdquo;) was the area where the choir and accompanists gathered to provide music for masses and other religious functions. It was usually a loft built over the entrance. In some rare cases it was located near the apse, just before and to one side of the sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_8\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In cathedrals, the coro was also the section where the&nbsp;<em>cabildo&nbsp;</em>(cathedral chapter), composed of the bishop and various religious dignitaries, gathered to chant their divine office. Unlike in many Spanish churches where the coro was located just in front of the main altar, the coro in Philippine churches was located away from the main altar and near the entrance. However a plan of Cebu Cathedral in 1719, places the coro in the center of the nave labelling it <strong>coro baxo</strong> (low choir), and this is likewise seen in the plan of Manila Cathedral in 1753. In the Vigan Cathedral, the coro is located in the apse. It seems to have been built in the early 20th century, but it may have replaced earlier constructions. There are no other local extant examples of this arrangement otherwise common in the larger churches in Europe and Latin America. <strong>Verjas</strong> or <strong>rehas</strong> (iron grilles) around such coros provided some measure of privacy for the clergy, separating them from the rest of the congregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the center of the coro was a large <strong>facistol</strong> (choir lectern), on which were propped&nbsp;<em>cantorales&nbsp;</em>or music books. A number of choir lecterns were four-sided and had rotating upper parts, as may still be seen in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a> in Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monastic churches such as those in Intramuros had rows of specially carved <strong>sillerias</strong> (choir stalls) lining the three sides of the choir loft, where the religious community gathered to chant the divine office. The silleria of the San Agustin Church in Intramuros, said to date from ca 1608 to 1611, is a masterpiece of the woodcarver and furniture maker&rsquo;s art. The rows of seats are intricately carved and inlaid with wood. The undersides of the seats are provided with <strong>misereres</strong> (misericords), small wooden ledges on which tired, weak, or aged friars could lean while standing during prayers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the bell tower was built adjacent to the church, the <strong>bautisterio</strong> (baptistry or baptistery) was placed at its first story so it would be near the main door of the church. In Europe, the baptistry as a structure separate from the church was common during the Renaissance but fell out of favor during the Baroque. The baptistry&rsquo;s location near the door was dictated by the rites, which considered the unbaptized child unworthy to enter the main body of the church. Some baptistries were afterthoughts, added to the side of the church, in the case of Lauang and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/307\">Guiuan</a>, Samar. The baptistry was traditionally decorated with an image of Christ&rsquo;s baptism in the Jordan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>naveta</strong> (nave) could be bounded by colonnades separating it from the side aisles. This is especially true in neoclassic and neo-Gothic churches. In the San Agustin, the nave is flanked by cryptocollateral chapels&mdash;i.e., side chapels not immediately visible from the entrance. The nave was the place for the laity, and the <strong>comulgatorio</strong> (communion rail) separated it from the <strong>santuario</strong> or <strong>presbiterio</strong> (sanctuary or presbytery), which was elevated by one or several steps above the church floor. The santuario or presbiterio was named thus because here, holy (Latin&nbsp;<em>sanctus</em>) rites were performed by priests (from Greek&nbsp;<em>presbyteros</em>, &ldquo;elder,&rdquo; &ldquo;priest&rdquo;). Dominating the sanctuary was the altar mayor with its retablo, raised an obligatory three steps above the sanctuary floor. To one side of the sanctuary was the sacristy, where vestments and vessels used for church rites were kept. This was also where the priest and acolytes vested. In some instances, especially in monasteries or large conventos&mdash;such as those of the San Agustin in Intramuros; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/352\">St Peter</a> in Pakil, Laguna; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Immaculate Conception</a> in Baclayon, Bohol&mdash;the sacristy was a room within the living quarters of the priests. Sacristies could also be independent structures that abutted the sanctuary of the church, as in Santa Cruz, Marinduque. The sacristies had <strong>aparadores</strong> (large cabinets) for vestments and church records. A separate treasure room was sometimes built near the sacristy. This well-fortified place housed vessels and appurtenances of gold and silver, objects of ivory, and gem-studded vestments and vessels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the church had a crucero (transept), the altares menores were found at the transept. The right side facing the main altar was called the epistle transept because, during the Mass, the epistle was read at the right side. The left side was called the gospel transept because the Missal was then transferred to the left for the gospel, to symbolize the bringing of the gospel to the Gentiles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pulpit occupied a prominent place in the nave. It fell into disuse with the liturgical reforms of Vatican II. Of finely carved wood or of well-crafted wrought iron, the pulpit was an efficient acoustical device. Its hollow hemispherical base and its hemispherical canopy, called <strong>torna voz</strong>, worked together as resonators of the preacher&rsquo;s voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Church Complex</strong>. The <strong>convento</strong>, which was the priest&rsquo;s residence, was attached to the church, usually on one side but sometimes behind or beside as a separate structure, which could be connected by a bridge or attached to the church front forming an L-plan. More uncommon is the convento built behind the church like a continuation of the sacristy, as seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/271\">Boac</a>, Marinduque. The convento followed the structure of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). Some are entirely of stone or brick like the conventos of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/382\">Sarrat</a>, Ilocos Norte; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\">Tanay</a>, Rizal; and the Santo Ni&ntilde;o in Cebu. The convento of Badoc, Ilocos Norte, is a one-story building raised a few meters above the ground. The only three-story convento is found in Loboc, Bohol, damaged by the 2013 earthquake that hit Bohol and Cebu. Around Laguna de Bay, the Franciscans built a number of conventos in the monastic style&mdash;i.e., with a courtyard enclosed by the church on one side and by the convento on three sides. Examples of this plan survive in Baras and Tanay, both in Rizal; and Pakil and Majayjay, both in Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The convento was the second most important structure in a Philippine town, the first being the church. It also served as lodging house for visiting dignitaries, storeroom for food and munitions, school, office, parish archives, and, in some cases, jails and places of punishment. The convento served so many functions, including civil ones, partly because of the failure to build other structures as required by colonial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">urban planning</a>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a> (royal house), which should have housed visiting dignitaries, was often of nipa and bamboo; so were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">school</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>tribunal</strong></a>, which was both courthouse and jail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fronting the church and convento was the plaza, also called <strong>patio</strong> or <strong>atrio</strong>. The open space allowed an unobstructed view of the church and enabled passersby to appreciate its full majesty. A tall wooden cross, called atrial cross, stood at the middle of the patio. It was customary for children studying catechism in the parish school to pray and sing before the cross to and from classes. Before Holy Week, a <strong>kubol</strong> or temporary shelter was set up for the Palm Sunday services. The patio was the setting for the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\">salubong</a>&nbsp;</em>of Easter Sunday, the benediction on the feasts of Corpus Christi and Cristo Rey, and the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a>&nbsp;</em>and moralistic plays during the town fiestas. A patio could be enclosed by a low catenated or swayback wall. At the four corners of the patio are <strong>capillas posas</strong>, small outdoor oratories which were stations during processional services. Capillas posas, common in Mexico, are found only in a few places such as Argao, Cebu; Tayum, Abra; and Minalin, Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fully developed church complex usually included the church, the convento, and the patio and its structures. In places subject to slave raiding, the complex also included the fortification and auxiliary structures such as ovens, stables, and storage areas for food supplies and ammunition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Church Construction Finances</strong>. The common belief that the churches were built primarily and only from tribute and with forced labor stems from a simplification fostered by the reform movement, voiced loudly by the Propaganda Movement, and reinforced by American polemicists who sought to disparage the contribution of Spain to the Philippines in an effort to bolster American claims to the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The institution of tribute has been grossly misrepresented as source of income. Not until the 19th century was the population large enough to make tribute a lucrative source of income. Tribute was a family tax, about one peso a year, a mere pittance even by the standards then. Tribute remained in force until the 19th century when the&nbsp;<em>cedula personal&nbsp;</em>(community certificate) was established for which a graduated fee was collected. Forced labor or&nbsp;<em>corvee&nbsp;</em>was limited to 60 days per year and only for males. Labor was expended for public works, like roads, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortifications</a>, and the construction of galleons, supervised by the civil state. Only when there was surplus personnel could the males be employed in the construction of churches. Some males could opt to meet their quota of 60 days by working on a town church. An elaborate system of exemption from both tribute and labor also greatly reduced their usefulness as sources of income and manpower. Exempted were the elderly and infirm, the children of the&nbsp;<em>principalia&nbsp;</em>(ruling class), and those who rendered military service. Some forms of corvee labor, like working on the galleons, was more onerous than others, so some opted to build the town church if one was under construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parishes were obliged to keep a book of&nbsp;<em>cargo y data&nbsp;</em>(financial record of income and expenses), which was examined by ecclesiastical authorities. The cargo y data shows that skilled labor was paid about the rate of one peso and one cavan of rice per month during the late 18th century. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">Retablos</a>, bells, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2107\">silver and gold work</a>, and other delicate appurtenances were paid for. These were works of skilled artisans, male and female. A gold monstrance could cost about 500 pesos during the mid-17th century, a chalice about 50 pesos, and a set of vestments with gold and silver embroidery about 187 pesos during the late 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these do not imply that forced labor was not employed in church construction, in some cases harshly. Historical records reveal that the town of Majayjay was quickly depopulated, as residents would flee to another town rather than build the enormous church and convento in this vacation town of the Franciscans. It should be noted that corvee or forced labor was used even in premodern states that were never colonized, like Thailand, pre-Dutch Java, or pre-19th century European monarchies. Since little money circulated in the rural sector of these noncapitalist economies, labor services for the state supplemented monetary taxes. In a premodern context, organized religion and state were one. Thus, religious buildings tended to be regarded as public works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To raise funds for building, friars and priests depended on royal patronage. The king contributed a third of the cost of building and paid for the wheat, wine, and oil needed for the rites. Part of the fund came from the&nbsp;<em>situado</em>, a silver subsidy that came from Mexico and continued to be sent to the Philippines until 1815. Even more crucial to the generation of income to pay for their missionary enterprise, including construction, was the system of internal and external trade engaged in by the religious communities. This trade in products of haciendas such as rice and vegetables, and exports through the galleon of products such as beeswax, canvas, and even ivory statuary and paintings, greatly enhanced income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church also relied on patronage from pious persons, both in Europe and Mexico, and in the Philippines. Such patrons included governor-generals, priests and religious from noble or wealthy European and Mexican families, and successful&nbsp;<em>criollo&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>mestizo sangley&nbsp;</em>merchants. These persons would donate money, jewelry, or land as a votive offering to a particular church or shrine for a prayer answered. Toward this end, for instance, salt beds were given to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/314\">Kawit Church</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2237\">Virgin of Antipolo</a> assumed a legal identity as the owner of lands and property. Some churches were paid for by friends and family of the missionaries, or by the occasional windfall. In Palo, Leyte, Fr Pantaleon de la Fuente, OFM, paid for the reconstruction of the convento and the installation of clocks in its church towers out of his winnings from the Madrid sweepstakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fund, called&nbsp;<em>sanctorum</em>, was collected during the annual confessions held at Easter. The fund financed celebrations, not construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public buildings, including churches, were subject to control. A priest wishing to build or even repair a church was asked to prepare a project proposal, accompanied by appropriate sketches or plans and estimates of cost, to the bishop who then approved or disapproved the plans. A good number of 19th-century proposals are kept in the archives of the Archdiocese of Manila. Many plans were not carried out, but the finest of these show the work of professional architects. Among the religious, plans were sent to the provincial superior and, in some cases, to the superior or master general in Rome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction and repair of churches was sometimes contracted out to builders, a good number of whom were Chinese. This system, called <strong>paquiao</strong> (<em>pakyaw&nbsp;</em>in Tagalog), was responsible in part for the construction of the Manila Cathedral, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2654\">Juan de Uguccioni</a>. This system apparently was also employed for the retablos, parts of which were contracted out and then clearly inventoried. Churches were subject to yearly&nbsp;<em>inventario&nbsp;</em>(inventories) during the bishop or provincial superior&rsquo;s visitation. These inventory lists were carefully kept in parish archives. They recorded every acquisition of a church under different headings: <strong>altares</strong> or altars; <strong>ornamentos</strong>, vestments; <strong>alajas de oro</strong>, golden diadems, crowns, and vessels; <strong>alajas de plata</strong>, silver vessels; and <strong>alajas de cobre</strong>, copper vessels. Bells were also inventoried, their weight, material, and inscriptions duly recorded. As for expenses for repair or renovation, these were carefully recorded in the cargo y data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cabecera-Visita Complex.</strong> A temporary church of bamboo and nipa, or wood and tile, was first constructed in a newly organized community called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\"><strong>reduccion</strong></a> or <strong>rancheria</strong>. As the community became more organized and acquired material wealth, it was raised to the status of pueblo or town. The pueblo had a geographic center, the <strong>poblacion</strong>, which was the most organized; satellite communities called <strong>barrios</strong>; and even smaller units called <strong>sitios</strong>. In ecclesiastical parlance, the poblacion became the center of a <strong>parroquia</strong> (parish). The center was called <strong>cabecera</strong>, the principal seat; and the outlying barrios, <strong>visitas</strong>. Visitas were so called because the priests did not reside in these places but rather visited them for the duration of their annual fiestas and other important feasts. The <strong>cabecera-visita</strong>, <strong>parroquia-visita</strong>, or <strong>poblacion-visita</strong> complex laid the foundations for the development of towns and parishes. As the visita&rsquo;s population increased in number, it was raised to parish status. A condition for such, however, was the building of a church and convento. Hence, the date of church construction always antedates the creation of a parish, though the early churches were often of wood, bamboo, and thatch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Styles and Religious Orders.</strong> The Catholic clergy was divided into two groups. The seculars (from Latin&nbsp;<em>saeculum&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;time,&rdquo; and figuratively, the world of human affairs) were affiliated with a diocese and subject to the bishop; they lived among their parishioners in the world. The regulars (from Latin&nbsp;<em>regula&nbsp;</em>&ldquo;rule,&rdquo;) belonged to the religious orders, were bound by one common rule or law, and grouped themselves according to provinces. The friar orders were not part of the regular clergy. In the usual order of evangelization, the friars pioneered in the conversion of peoples, to be succeeded by the seculars who took charge of normal parish duties. A different system evolved in the Philippines, which took two years&rsquo; travel by galleon from Spain via Mexico. The regular clergy&mdash;i.e., Spanish friars&mdash;would mostly officiate at the altars of Filipino churches for more than three centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first to seriously begin evangelizing were the Augustinians who came with Legazpi&rsquo;s expeditionary forces in 1565. This order built the most number of churches in the country, since it had the largest number of parishes. Their territories included the entire Ilocos region, northern Bulacan, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Batangas, southeastern Cebu, and Panay Island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Franciscans, who followed in 1578, carried out their ministry in the towns bordering the eastern shores of Laguna de Bay, lying now within the boundaries of Rizal and Laguna provinces; the long strip of land now comprising the coastline of Isabela; and the provinces of Aurora and Quezon, some towns in northern Nueva Ecija, and the entire Bicol area. Samar Island and eastern Leyte were turned over to them after the Jesuit expulsion in 1768.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving in 1581, the Jesuits commenced work in some towns around Manila within present-day Rizal province, and expanded to Cavite province, the Negros islands, Samar, Leyte, Bohol, Mindoro and Marinduque, and to parts of Mindanao. In 1595, a royal decree stipulated that the Philippines be divided into regions for the purposes of evangelization. At this time the Jesuits were given charge of eastern Visayas (except Cebu) and Mindanao. In 1767 Carlos III ordered the expulsion of all Jesuits from Spain and her colonies, a decree which took effect in the Philippines the following year; their vacated parishes were turned over to both the secular and regular clergy. In 1773 the order was suppressed by Pope Clement XIV. After their restoration in 1814, the Jesuits returned to the Philippines in 1859 and did most of their apostolic work in Manila and Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the Jesuits were the Dominicans, who landed in 1587. They built churches in the region that now comprises the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Isabela, Cagayan, Batanes, Pangasinan, and Bataan. They also held some parishes in Cavite and western Laguna, attached to their haciendas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last large order to arrive was that of the Recollects or Discalced Augustinians, who came in 1606. Partly because of their late arrival, they were assigned some of the most difficult mission territories, such as Palawan, Zambales (ceded to them by the Dominicans in 1712), northern Bataan, western Pangasinan, and the eastern portion of Mindanao. Later on they spread to northeastern Cebu and to the islands of Mindoro, Romblon, and Masbate, the Jesuit territories in the islands of Negros and Bohol, as well as parishes in Mindoro. Cavite and the rest of Mindanao were turned over to them after 1768.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seculars, although here as early as 1564, were always too few and never formed as large a community as the religious clergy. They chiefly occupied positions in the cathedrals but also held a few widely scattered parishes. During the early 17th century, they were assigned the islands of Marinduque, Mindoro, and Negros, but, for lack of human resources, they ceded them to the regulars&mdash;namely, the Recollects and the Jesuits. At various times they ministered to towns and erected churches in Cavite, Batangas, Pampanga, Ilocos Sur, Abra, Cebu, Iloilo, Negros Island, and western and southern Leyte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theoretically, the religious were to open missions and, once these were stable, turn them over to the seculars. In fact, the parishes were belatedly turned over to them. Well into the 19th century, many seculars were coadjutors of the regulars. Many seculars were Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the Hospital Order of the Brothers of San Juan de Dios, who first arrived in 1641, performed their apostolic labors in hospitals, which they administered in Cavite and Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the twilight of the 19th century, two more orders came to share in the missionary work. The Capuchins, a branch of the Franciscan order established in 1529, opened their first chapel in Intramuros in 1890. The Benedictines of Montserrat arrived in 1895 and were assigned the Jesuit parishes in Surigao, where they were to establish agricultural communities as a strategy for consolidating Spanish rule in Mindanao. The Benedictine mission was short lived, as the Revolution of 1896 overtook them. However, the Benedictines were able to build a few churches, that of Cantilan being the best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No religious order determined the style of its church, nor did the assignment of an order to a specific region result in the emergence of a regional style. All orders, even the seculars, built large, solid, and magnificent churches if the parishes could afford them. But there were as well a large number of wooden-and-thatch churches, which each order maintained in the poorer parts of their districts. Historical styles&mdash;such as baroque, rococo, and neo-Gothic&mdash;were adopted by each of the orders and modified according to local conditions. In several cases, however, style seems to have been more dependent on an area than on the order. For instance, the Franciscan churches in the Bicol area are mostly small and simple and, with few exceptions, simply decorated. The same cannot be said of churches of the same order in the area around Laguna de Bay south of Manila, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/351\">Paete</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/352\">Pakil</a>, Tanay, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">Morong</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/324\">Lucban</a> in Quezon, which are exuberantly carved and decorated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are details or silhouettes common to a number of structures in a given area or period, like certain late 18th-century Dominican churches in the Cagayan Valley, late 18th-century Augustinian churches in southeastern Cebu, or mid-19th-century Augustinian churches in Iloilo. Churches built by seculars, such as those of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/368\">Samboan</a> in Cebu and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/344\">Molo</a> in Iloilo, have the same elements as those built by regulars. The facade of the secular-built church of Gen Trias in Cavite is virtually a copy of the Augustinian church of Santa Lucia, Ilocos Sur. Such instances might indicate a &ldquo;school of architects&rdquo; or perhaps, more accurately, just one builder&rsquo;s idiosyncrasies. They are usually not enough, however, to warrant the attribution of a style to a particular order. Thus one cannot properly speak of an &ldquo;Augustinian grand style&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Jesuit baroque style.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Church styles &ldquo;would tend to change from period to period,&rdquo; and as &ldquo;churches were being built, destroyed, and rebuilt constantly during the whole three-century Spanish rule, identifying regional styles becomes complicated&rdquo; (Legarda 1981, 70). Churches built during the late 19th century are easy to identify. While their facades and retablos were built in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Revivalist</a> manner, the builder did not adhere strictly to one style but mixed neo-Gothic windows with Roman arches or a Greek-cross plan with Gothic finials. The periodization of older church styles is still tentative, although it is safe to say that not until the 1780s did rococo motifs appear. The earlier periods may be called baroque and, in some cases, plateresque. During the 19th century, Revivalist styles appeared. The neoclassical made its first appearance about the 1820s, while the neo-Gothic appeared ca 1860. Other influences&mdash;e.g., Chinese, Indian, Muslim, and Mexican&mdash;tend to blur stylistic characteristics. Thus, the styles of colonial churches came about by the confluence of regional influences, the aesthetic preferences of the group evangelizing a given place, period styles, foreign influences, the construction materials, the availability of competent architects and artists, and the availability of tools and technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manila, Cavite Puerto, and Cebu remained common territory; thus, the regulars had a church or more in these places. Manila boasted of seven churches aside from the mother churches of the religious orders, the cathedral of the seculars, and the church of the Venerable Orden Tercera, a lay branch of the Franciscans; the order of San Juan de Dios added a fine church built beside its hospital. Cebu had a Jesuit college with its church and a Chinese parish under the seculars, aside from its cathedral and the Santo Ni&ntilde;o Church of the Augustinians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Intramuros, the port city of Cavite, which is present-day Cavite City, had a defensive wall surrounding it. In this enclosure were the Augustinian, Franciscan, Dominican, and Recollect churches; the Colegio de Cavite, with its church dedicated to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Loreto of the Jesuits; and the shrine to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Dolores, aka Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Porta Vaga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Augustinians built the most number of churches, 264 of which are still standing. Among these the widest is Taal, 44 m wide, and the longest, Sarrat, 115 m long. Augustinian churches are characterized by Catholicity of styles ranging from the Renaissance to the Revivalist, including the rococo, as in Argao, Cebu, and the plateresque, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/390\">Tigbauan</a>, Iloilo. The church in Miag-ao, Iloilo, is the most imaginative of the Augustinian facades. Flanked by two massive towers, the facade is lavishly decorated. The bas-relief at the pediment depicts San Cristobal and the Child Jesus in a landscape lush with tropical vegetation, particularly fruit trees. Thus, it also depicts the farmer&rsquo;s indigenous practice of carrying his son on his shoulder while planting a coconut tree so that it will bear more fruit (Echauz 1894, 37).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dominican churches of the Cagayan Valley are distinguished by common characteristics&mdash;the use of bricks; clay insets in the form of rosettes, festoons, cornucopiae, sun faces, angel faces, floral and foliate forms, animal and human figures, as well as religious symbols and coats of arms; flying buttresses; and salomonica columns in alternating arrangements with plain columns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ivatan of Batanes held on to their own belief system until the end of the 18th century, as the Batanes were pummeled by strong winds and treacherous currents, which made crossing difficult. The church of Mahatao, like other Batanes churches, is built of stone bound together with lime and finished with a layer of stucco, the same type of building the Ivatan were to adopt for their houses. The Mahatao facade is similar to the California mission style. Engaged columns divide the facade into five sections, the central one being the widest. The central portion rises to four uneven stories, the topmost being an espada&ntilde;a crowned by a semicircular pediment. Only in the central sections are there openings. The facade is decorated with finials. To the right of the facade are the stone convento, which has an arcade in front, and a walkway above the arcade. The Basco Church also uses the espada&ntilde;a. It is a more graceful&mdash;though severe&mdash;version of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/327\">Mahatao Church</a> facade. Pilasters rather than columns decorate the facade, and a double arch, Roman below and Gothic above, defines the main entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The all-steel neo-Gothic church of San Sebastian, built by the Recollects to replace earlier structures of stone and wood, was designed in Manila by Genaro Palacios and constructed of steel plates in Belgium. The prefabricated structure was brought to Manila in 10 ships, assembled and then decorated by Manila artists. The seculars built outstanding churches in these towns and provinces mostly during the 19th century&mdash;Quiapo, Manila; Molo, Iloilo; Dumaguete, Negros Oriental; Parian and Mandaue, Cebu; and Sogod, Cabalian, and Baybay, Leyte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although most churches were built at the initiative of priests, friars, and the townsfolk, the colonial government, which expended its energies most of the time on civil and military structures, did build a few church-related buildings, such as the chapels at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/300\">Fort San Felipe</a> in Cavite. A notable work is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/350\">Paco Cemetery</a>, built in 1850 for the victims of cholera. Two circular walls enclose an elliptical chapel with a stone dome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>20th-Century Catholic Churches</strong>. Church building in the hispanic tradition continued into the 20th century, such as that in Dauis, Bohol, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/312\">Jasaan</a>, Misamis Oriental. Churches that were not finished during the Spanish period were completed with great difficulty during the American regime, because the government no longer supported church construction. Early 20th-century churches were done in Revivalist styles, such as the neo-Romanesque and the neo-Gothic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>World War II destroyed many churches. Those rebuilt after the war showed a tendency to adopt new styles. For the sixth <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a>, built in Quezon City from 1952 to 1954, the architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2708\">Jose Zaragoza</a> employed a modernized Spanish-mission style. In the 1950s two new churches departed from the longitudinal plan and employed a central plan in which the altar was at the middle, with pews arranged around it. The circular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice</a> at the University of the Philippines (UP), which was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Leandro V. Locsin</a>, aimed to bring the people closer to the Mass. The polygonal St Thomas More Chapel of the Ateneo de Manila on Padre Faura, designed by Gines Rivera, had the same aim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Churches built after Vatican II, 1961-65, followed the prescriptions of the Council, which decreed active participation of the congregation as well as greater visibility of the rites at the altar. The altar became a freestanding table that enabled the mass celebrant to face the people. The pulpit in the nave disappeared and was replaced by a lectern located at the sanctuary. Examples of post-Vatican II churches are St Andrew&rsquo;s, Makati; Santa Maria de la Strada, Quezon City; and Christ the King, Greenmeadows. The old churches were renovated to conform to the Council&rsquo;s directive that the Mass be celebrated facing the people. Unfortunately, a good number of colonial churches were renovated by ill-advised persons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Churches</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aglipayan Churches.</strong> At the turn of the century, Gregorio Aglipay, the military vicar of the Philippine revolutionary army, formed the Iglesia Filipina Independiente and cut all relations with the Roman Catholic Church. Popularly called Aglipayan, this group took possession of many Catholic churches until a Supreme Court ruling in the early 1900s restored ownership of churches and lands to the Roman Catholic Church. When the Aglipayans did build, they constructed simple structures of bamboo and thatch or of wood. Since Aglipayan rites closely resemble Catholic rites and, more recently, Episcopalian rites, to which a branch of the church has ties, the plan of Aglipayan churches resembles that of Catholic churches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church in Batac, Ilocos Norte, is innovative in style. While the facade is traditional, it is the interior&rsquo;s use of stained glass that gives the church its unique style. The Cathedral of the Holy Child on Taft Ave, Manila, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2635\">Carlos Arguelles</a>, is in the contemporary idiom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Protestant Churches</strong>. Protestantism, which came with the Americans, emphasized reading of the Bible and preaching over the celebration of the sacraments, which a number of Protestants believe to be only two&mdash;Baptism and the Eucharist&mdash;in contrast to Catholics who acknowledge seven. Because of the emphasis on the Bible and preaching, the most prominent feature in a Protestant church is the altar, where an open bible is prominently displayed. To one side of the altar is a raised pulpit where the minister preaches. A number of chairs are placed in the sanctuary to accommodate those leading the rites. In many instances, the sanctuary accommodates the choir, as choral singing is an important part of worship. Outstanding Protestant churches in Manila are the Bradford Memorial (now Central Methodist Church) on T. M. Kalaw St, built in 1916 but restored after it was damaged during World War II; the Knox Memorial along Rizal Ave; and the Ellinwood Church in Malate. Also restored and opened in 2013 was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/273\">Bradford Church</a> in Cebu, along Osme&ntilde;a Ave. Well-preserved is the Silliman University Church in Dumaguete City. These churches are in the neo-Gothic style&mdash;a style also favored by mainline Protestant groups in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Church of the Risen Lord, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2646\">Cesar H. Concio</a> and located at the UP Diliman campus, deviates from the neo-Gothic style. It has a paraboloid roof that rises from ground level. The form of the church has been described as fishlike or as evoking the canvas roof of prairie schooners that once crossed the American plains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Situated on a hill overlooking Marikina valley, the Manila Philippines Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Greenmeadows, Quezon City has impressive stained glass windows and six neo-Gothic spires. On top of the tallest spire is a gilded angel. Designed by Church A&amp;E Services with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2679\">Felipe M. Mendoza</a> &amp; Partners, the church was opened to the public in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) Churches.</strong> Felix Ysagun Manalo began preaching to Manila workers in 1914. After Manalo&rsquo;s death in 1963, his son Era&ntilde;o, became the executive minister. The Bible, as interpreted by Manalo, is the only source of truth. Worship takes place on Thursdays and Sundays and consists of psalm and hymn singing, prayers, and offerings. The main event is an hour-long sermon on doctrine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The houses of worship are called <strong>kapilya</strong> (chapel), in memory of the humble beginnings of the church, and the <strong>sambahan</strong> (house of worship), which is its equally humble prototypic building. Houses of worship are called &ldquo;kapilya&rdquo; regardless of size. Only the house of worship at the central office in Quezon City is called a <strong>templo</strong> (temple), although the San Fernando Kapilya is popularly known as the Templo Central Luzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, the INC met in private houses. The faithful living within a particular vicinity, called <strong>lokal</strong> (locale), soon began building makeshift houses of light materials such as bamboo, nipa, and cogon. The lokal of Tondo built the first house of worship along Gabriela St in 1918. Subsequently, provincial lokal built houses in Tiaong, Guiguinto, Bulacan; Pe&ntilde;aranda, Nueva Ecija; Sapang Tagalog, Tarlac; and Gen Trias, Cavite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medium-sized chapels of sturdier materials, like wood and galvanized iron, were constructed in the 1930s. A few surviving examples are Bambang, Luisiana, Santa Maria, and Siniloan, all in Laguna. Just before the outbreak of World War II, the semi-concrete house, like the Punta Santa Ana Chapel, appeared. In 1948 Manalo employed the services of the architect Rufino Antonio, who designed the first concrete kapilya in Sampaloc. This 800-seat castle-like structure employed the Gothic windows and spires that characterized later structures. The central office complex and chapel, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2698\">Carlos Santos-Viola</a>, was dedicated on 17 Mar 1952. The Caloocan Kapilya, fully air-conditioned and accommodating 1,200 persons, was built that same year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after came the Cubao kapilya, 1954, which was designed by Santos-Viola and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2672\">Alfredo Luz</a>. After this partnership broke up, Santos-Viola became the architect of most of the major kapilya all over the country. However, Raul Villanueva did design the kapilya of Solis, Tondo, 1955. The year 1954 saw the building of the 2,000-seat Pasay Kapilya. Then followed those of Baguio; Paco, Manila; Makati City; Angeles City, Pampanga; San Jose, Mindoro Oriental; Cabanatuan City, Nueva Ecija; Bacoor, Cavite; Tarlac, Tarlac; Malabon, Rizal; Lucena City, Quezon; San Francisco del Monte, Quezon City; Concepcion, Tarlac; Bago Bantay, Quezon City; San Pablo City, Laguna; and San Fernando, Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1971 the INC formally organized its Engineering and Construction Department to take care of the construction and maintenance of the church&rsquo;s buildings. By the 1980s it took over the design of even major kapilya. It was headed by Bienvenido G. Manalo, assisted by Herman E. Bilang. But the Templo Central, 1982-83, is Santos-Viola&rsquo;s work. It contains five main areas for worship. The central hall, called the &ldquo;templo,&rdquo; seats 3,000. Two side chapels have a total capacity of 1,931, beside the observation rooms located above them. The Cubao kapilya is a giant shell made of reinforced concrete, lifting lyrically as one continuous Gothic arch. A vast traceried window decorates the facade. Because shell construction is expensive, subsequent INC structures use a lighter framework consisting of trusses resting on pillars of reinforced concrete. Trusses used to be of wood; as long beams became rare and expensive, they were replaced by steel. The sidewalls are of poured concrete for durability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An INC facade often has an arch that is either triangular or Tudor, flanked by tall, slender towers tapering into spires. Sometimes a spire rises in between the two, directly over the facade. At the kapilya&rsquo;s rear end are two additional towers, also on both sides of the building. Entrances are dramatized with cantilevered canopies in wavelike patterns. Galleries run beside the kapilya, connecting front with rear, to create a protected area for taking in the air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two separate entrances for the sexes. On the wall in-between is a cardholder with membership cards. At the men&rsquo;s entrance is a deacon&rsquo;s room; at the women&rsquo;s, a deaconess&rsquo;s. Within the body of the kapilya, men and women sit separately on either side of a central aisle. The hall&rsquo;s focus is a <strong>tribuna</strong>, a dais with an imposing lectern, on which the Bible rests and from which preaching is done. Behind the tribuna rises a tiered stage for choirs. Under the tower on each side is a dressing room for each of the sexes. If the kapilya is big, there is a second-floor balcony, the stairs to which are located within the front towers. The towers thus define functional areas. Newer kapilya have a nursery room from which parents with infants can attend the ritual. Older churches had a <strong>bautisterio</strong>, or baptistery, with a pool for the baptism of adults by immersion. However, this feature has disappeared in the later design. Only central houses of worship have a bautisterio, which is used by neighboring kapilya. In some cases, baptism is held in rivers or other bodies of water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>INC interiors are well lit and airy, as they have many windows of plain glass and high ceilings. The emphasis is on fellowship rather than on mystery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towers and spires are many and decorated with openwork tracery. Walls feature elongated mullions with flat arches, weblike tracery, or frets in precast. Decorations are nonfigurative. Felix Manalo chose Gothic because it seemed ecclesiastical. In fact, Gothic was only a starting point. The lavish openwork tracery in towers and spires is possible because of modern materials. So are the fancy towers that gradate in tiers before ending in spikes or forming corollas that taper to a point. The windowless but decorated facades embraced by a huge Tudor arch is another innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the INC entered the 21st century and approached its centennial, the INC built more churches in strategic areas, usually beside newly developed roadways and in developing town and city centers. The style of the church has also evolved. The strictly Gothic style is mixed with the Roman arch characteristic of Romanesque, and the facade and flanking towers are articulated with ornamentation. The INC sambahan have adapted three external color schemes: the more common cream wall and red roof; the white wall and green roof, such as those of the INC templo in Quezon City; and the gray wall and blue roof of more recent constructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ecclesiastical Eccentricity and Colonial Nostalgia.</strong> After Vatican II, new Catholic churches were built that were plain, functional, and little ornamented. Except for a crucifix, tabernacle, altar, and sanctuary furniture, these churches had little visual appeal inside. From the outside, some did not look like traditional churches at all, as architects came up with novel alternatives, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2674\">Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa</a>&rsquo;s design for the Mary Immaculate Parish Church, completed in 1986, more than 20 years after Vatican II. The church was constructed in what was once a 4,000-square-meter mango orchard at BF Almanza in Moonwalk, Las Pi&ntilde;as. Popularly called the Nature Church, it resembles a tent but is open on all sides and thus blends well with the surrounding orchard. Another post-Vatican II church is the Metropolitan Cathedral of Zamboanga, built from 1998 to 2002. Although its cruciform plan is traditional, its facade is said to have been inspired by votive offerings of candles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phrase, &ldquo;ecclesiastical eccentricity,&rdquo; has been coined by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2668\">Gerard Lico</a> to refer to churches that do not fit neatly into traditional forms and models of churches. It is not limited to Catholic churches but is also found in Protestant churches. Examples are the neo-modernist Church of the Gesu, 2002, of the Ateneo de Manila University, designed by Jose Pedro Recio and Carmelo Casas; the New Millennium Evangelical Church, 2003, which resembles a six-story office building, except for a corner which tapers like a bell tower and terminates in a cross; and the Ampoanan sa Kalinaw ug Kinaadman, 2002, at the botanical garden of Southwestern University in Cebu, designed by national artist for sculpture, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3376\">Napoleon V. Abueva</a>. This church building is at the same time a piece of monumental and kinetic sculpture (Lico 2008, 539-42).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reaction to this modernism, in Catholic circles there has been a return to traditional designs, a nostalgia for tradition. Baroque-inspired retablos have been installed at the sanctuary of churches, and the iconic features of recognizably Catholic buildings have been copied to give these churches the traditional look. St. Peter&rsquo;s Parish Church on Commonwealth Ave, established in 1993, has a cupola that is a copy of that of St. Peter&rsquo;s in Rome. It has a classical portico, reminiscent of the Madeleine in France. The dome of Santa Clara de Montefalco Church in Pasig is a copy of that of St. Peter&rsquo;s in Rome. A neobaroque church is Jesus the Way, the Truth, and the Life, built near the SM Megaworld on reclaimed land from the sea. It was built to honor Pope John Paul II, who visited the Philippines for World Youth Day in 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mega Church</strong>. This is a new development with roots in the Protestant evangelical churches in the US where the American term &ldquo;megachurch&rdquo; refers to a building that can accommodate a large number of people for a service&mdash;2,000 and more. Although large congregations of evangelicals met as early as the 1950s, the congregations met in public places like gyms, parks, and other open spaces and not in churches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because his services were aired in the Philippines, Dr Robert H. Schuller&rsquo;s Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Orange County, California, in the United States became well known in the Philippines. The mega church was built for the Reformed Church in America founded in 1955 by Schuller. The reflective glass building, designed by American architect Philip Johnson, was completed in 1981 and seated 2,736 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From this evangelical inspiration, similar structures have been built in the Philippines, not necessarily by evangelicals but TV preachers and congregations that have large followings. El Shaddai, also known as the Catholic Charismatic Renewal movement, founded by Mike Velarde inaugurated a one-billion-peso House of Prayer on a 10-hectare property at Amvel City, San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque. The building is 10,000 sqm with a 16,000 seating capacity and additional standing room for 25,000. Shaped as two large concave halls intersecting each other and crowned by a glass pyramid at the center, its central motif is the rainbow outside outlining the arch-shaped building, and another rainbow arching over the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Televangelist Apollo Quiboloy has a cathedral along the Buhangin Highway in Davao City. It is shaped like an enormous inverted saucer. The ceiling is completely painted over by a sky interspersed with clouds. At the center of this ceiling is an octagon on which is painted the name of Quiboloy&rsquo;s congregation and which has two inner circles of yellow and red. Eight lines radiate from the octagon to the rim of the building. Hundreds of individual chairs face a dais. During a service, Quiboloy preaches from this dais, while behind him are video images of serene nature scenes. As of 2016, Quiboloy&rsquo;s grander multifunctional stadium, called King Dome, is under construction. It is along the Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway, near the Davao airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine Arena of the INC was completed on 27 Jul 2014 for its centennial. Built on 7.5 ha of land, the dome is 3.6 ha and about 60 m, or 15 stories, high. The structure, being a dome, is no longer called a &ldquo;church,&rdquo; &ldquo;sambahan,&rdquo; or &ldquo;kapilya.&rdquo; Architecturally, it is a large sports stadium. The difference is that the stage, which can also be used for indoor sports, is to one side of the dome and not at the center, as with most sports domes. The off-center stage allows the use of the dome for services, concerts, and other events, local or international. The Philippine Arena is part of a mixed-use development complex that includes the Era&ntilde;o G. Manalo Medical Center, the New Era University-Bocaue Campus, and the New Era Sports Complex and Stadium. These buildings and the dome are in Ciudad de Victoria, which straddles the municipalities of Bocaue and Santa Maria, Bulacan.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p><strong><strong>Sinehan</strong></strong>&mdash;from&nbsp;<em>cine</em>, a shortened form of the French patent label &ldquo;cinematografo,&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>han</em>, a Tagalog suffix denoting place&mdash;also known as <strong>sine</strong>, is a place for showing motion pictures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 1 Jan 1897, the photographer Se&ntilde;or Pertiens presented a program entitled <strong><em>Espectaculo Cientifico de Pertiens&rsquo;s</em></strong> (Pertiens&rsquo;s Scientific Show) at No 12 Escolta, which turned out to be a showing of chronophotographs. The real film screening happened on 18 Sep 1897, when the Swiss businessmen Leibman and Peritz screened several Lumiere films on a Lumiere cinematograph. To accompany the silent screenings, a quintet played music under Maestro Francisco P. de Barbat. First-class seats cost two pesos, while second-class cost one peso. After this screening, other films were shown in other venues, including the first moving pictures shot in the Philippines by the Spanish Antonio Ramos, which depicted Manila street scenes and the Quiapo fiesta, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Philippine-American War, an Englishman reopened the sinehan at No 60 Santa Rosa in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> which was called Cine Walgrah after its owner. In 1902, the Gran Cinematographo Parisien was opened at No 80 Calle Crespo in Quiapo by a Spanish businessman, Samuel Rebarber. By 1909, three Manila studios were firmly established and covered events like <strong><em>The Great Taal Disaster</em></strong>, <strong><em>Gold Mining in Paracale</em></strong>, and <strong><em>La Fiesta de Obando</em></strong>. In 1911 Pathe Freres Cinema, the first distributing agency in the country, began selling and leasing film projector gear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The projection of cinema was made possible by the construction of the first power plant in Manila in 1895 on the eve of the Philippine Revolution. But cinema took off only in the 1930s when the talkies rapidly overshadowed traditional theater productions such as the&nbsp;<em>sarsuwela&nbsp;</em>and drama during the American period. The first studios, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\">Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</a>, and Excelsior Pictures, produced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\">musicals</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\">dramas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\">horror pictures,</a> South Sea adventures, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\">historical films</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the 1910s and the 1930s, &ldquo;cinema architecture design began to evolve from and distinguish itself from the legitimate theater design&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2668\">Lico</a> 2008, 349). Lico further explained that the cinema house was designed from exterior to interior to &ldquo;attract potential cinema patrons from the street into the showcase, and then lead them into a dream world concocted by film &hellip; designers tried to inveigle the patron&rsquo;s imagination with fantasy utilizing architectural elements.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Movie houses</strong> did not differ much from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a>. The lower floor was called <strong>orchestra</strong>, and the upper floor with tiered seating was called <strong>balcony</strong>. Sometimes, balconies continued into <strong>galleries</strong> or <strong>wing balconies</strong>. The balcony was divided into the front and generally better-furnished area called loge, and the rear which retained the name balcony. On the stage, a screen was hung. During the silent film era, a small section below the screen was set aside for a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> or an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestra</a> that accompanied the film. The <strong>projection booth</strong> located opposite the screen and often above the orchestra seats was a necessary feature of the cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Movie houses began to mushroom all over the city and theaters originally built for stage productions began showing films. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a> at Azcarraga (now Claro M. Recto Ave) began showing films in 1909 and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Grand Opera House</a> nearby combined movies with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><em>bodabil</em></a>. Among the movie houses in full operation at this time were Anda, Paz, Cabildo, Empire, Majestic, Tivoli, Comedia, Apollo, Ideal, Luz, Savoy, and Gaiety. The Cinematografo Filipino, located at Azcarraga near Tutuban, the first Filipino-owned movie house, was opened in 1909.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Movie houses improved in the 1920s and the 1930s. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a> were the Lyric and Capitol theaters. On Rizal Ave were the Ideal, State, and Avenue Theaters. On Quezon Blvd were the Times and Life Theaters. These theaters became moviegoers&rsquo; paradise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>&rsquo;s Capitol Theater, inaugurated in 1935, used symmetric balance and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> motifs of recessed geometric grillwork on the central tower over the entrance marquee. Capitol&rsquo;s original interior, which was destroyed during World War II, used sampaguita, the Philippine national flower, as the motif of the wrought iron for the stairs, lobby, and foyer. At the center of the proscenium arch, were sampaguita in bloom, finished in white seashells. From it radiated four concentric circles of short bamboo nodes finished in concrete. Nakpil also designed the State Theater, 1935, and Avenue Theater, 1939, on Rizal Ave. State Theater followed the art deco-contoured silhouette highlighted by a decorative parapet with a central medallion and stylization of a carabao head. Destroyed during World War II, both theaters were rebuilt in 1946. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>&rsquo;s Lyric Theater used mudejar motifs instead of art deco, which was the common trend in cinema design. His first architectural work for cinema was the Ideal Theater, 1933, on Rizal Ave, originally built of wood in 1908.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life Theater, 1941, on Quezon Blvd was a first-class cinema devoted only to Filipino movies. The white facade fused art deco streaming and huge round columns tipped by a conical finial. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\">Luis Araneta</a>&rsquo;s Times Theater, 1941, like Pablo Antonio&rsquo;s Ideal Theatre, used an adaptation of the art moderne. Gen Douglas MacArthur inaugurated the Times theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not only in Manila&rsquo;s theater row that cinemas were built. Manila&rsquo;s suburbs had their own cinemas. In the district of Paco, Bellevue Theater, built in the mid-1930s, used a Mudejar-inspired art deco decoration on its facade. Cathay Theater, 1937, was located at the core of Manila&rsquo;s Chinese community on Gandara St. It was the only theater that showcased only Chinese movies. Its architecture was probably influenced by Chinese aesthetics. Then considered the country&rsquo;s most modern theater, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, built in 1931, had provisions for a projection machine. Its architect, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, used the art deco style for both the exterior and interior of the theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Movie houses were also built in the provinces. Prince was the best-known in Iloilo. Vision Theater on Calle Colon was built in the 1930s in the neoclassical style by Agustin Jereza, an educator and engineer. He established Jereza Construction Co and was responsible for many public and private projects in the Visayas and Cebu. Pines, 1939, and Session Theater, around 1930, both of which utilized art deco&rsquo;s plasticity, horizontality and stylization, were built in Baguio. In many provinces, movie houses had no air-conditioning, used hardwood seats, and were poorly maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the post-World War II era, more movie houses were erected along Rizal Ave, among them Ever Theater, remarkable for its elegant lobby. On Azcarraga St, the Cinerama was notable for its size and its giant three-projector screen. In the new suburbs developed in Makati by the Ayala company, Rizal Theater was built as the centerpiece of the commercial center setup to service the gated communities of San Lorenzo, Bel-Air, Forbes, and a little later Urdaneta and Dasmari&ntilde;as. Rizal Theater was designed by Juan Nakpil and completed in 1960. It introduced the one-floor auditorium in which the orchestra, loge, and balcony formed one continuous slope. This seating arrangement was to be emulated in movie houses that came later, especially those built in malls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mall,&rdquo; which originally meant an open-air plaza, has come to mean an open or covered concourse flanked by shops in contemporary society. It may contain a number of movie houses. These are not detached units but are part of the mall&rsquo;s structure. Movie houses in malls are generally smaller compared to earlier ones, which were separate buildings. The first successful mall was the Quad in Makati, built in the 1970s, whose main feature were four movie houses respectively called Q, U, A, and D. Other malls in Manila with movie houses are Ali Mall, Robinsons, Manuela, Shoemart, Shangri-La, Ayala, and Gotesco. These malls are often a chain, having more than one branch in the city. Malls with movie houses have also been built in provincial urban centers. In many provincial cities and towns like Baguio, Carmen in Pangasinan, Marikina and Taytay in Rizal, Roxas City, Iloilo, Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and Davao, the malls have the best theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proliferation of malls in Metro Manila starting in the 1980s and in the provinces by the 2000s popularized the multiplex. This is a cluster of movie houses all on one floor of the mall, with smaller theaters showing movies simultaneously. Patterned after the American multiplex which could be an independent structure, the Philippine version, embedded in a mall, may have four, six, eight or even more than a dozen theaters. When a movie is expected to be a box office hit, the same movie is shown either simultaneously or following staggered scheduling to accommodate the expected crowd. The smaller theater of the multiplex was a response to the diminishing number of moviegoers brought about by digital technology. As more people watched movies through computers or through on-demand television, viewership in theaters diminished. Unabated piracy of movies further contributed to the decline. The multiplex allows for flexibility: a movie unsure of its box office draw might initially show in one theater, but as word of mouth increases audience numbers, more theaters can open for its screening. The reverse is also true: movies that do not bring in audiences can easily be cancelled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shifting business of movie theaters has introduced technical innovations to attract audiences, like the Dolby sound system, which gives realistic and all-around sound, or the IMAX, a large wraparound screen or 3D. All these technologies cannot be recreated at home without a large budget, so the movie house offers these technologies to keep the audiences coming to the theaters. The multiplex as well as IMAX theaters are found in Ayala, Robinson&rsquo;s, and SM malls, among others.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>split-level house</strong> is a dwelling in which the floor levels of one or more rooms are separated by approximately half a story or less and connected by stairs. In general, the Philippine split-level house has two main levels, the lower portion which includes the living, dining, and kitchen area, and the elevated one which has the bedrooms. In some, the two levels are covered by one hip or gable roof, with the lower level having an unusually high ceiling. In other cases, especially in larger houses, the lower and higher sections have separate roofs, giving the houses a more interesting exterior appearance. The elevated portion of the split-level house is usually made of wood and may rest on concrete walls. If high enough, the space under the elevated portion is used for storage. The lower portion is almost always of concrete and is slightly above the ground level. The split-level arrangement effectively delineates the private and common spaces of the house by the slight change in levels, which spares the dweller the effort of negotiating a full staircase. The split-level house design enables one to build on sloping or irregular terrain, without extensively altering the topography.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to the split-level house is the <strong>one-and-a-half-story house</strong>. Also called one-and-a-half, it is actually a two-story dwelling in which the upper story covers only half of the lower floor. In other words, it has one story on one side but two on the other. The upper story, being only about half of the area of the ground floor, is the half story referred to in the term. On the ground floor are the living room, dining room, kitchen, and possibly a study or guest room. On the upper floor are the bedrooms, arranged along a corridor or along a balcony overlooking the living room and dining room. The one-and-a-half is suitable for small families which need only a few bedrooms. The one-floor and two-floor sections may have separate roofs, or may be covered by one roof. The upper floor may have a gable roof, one slope of which extends further down to cover the lower floor. The roof could also be one continuous slope, with the higher section covering the second story and the lower covering the first. With one roof over the house, the lower section gains the advantage of a high ceiling with a gentle or deep slope, depending on the pitch of the roof. This roof makes possible a second floor balcony that provides access to the bedrooms and overlooks the living room. The lower story could have masonry walls&mdash;brick, adobe, or concrete blocks&mdash;while the upper could have wooden sidings. The one-and-a-half emerged after World War II and became popular during the period of reconstruction, since it could offer both the openness of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\">bungalow</a> and the security of a two-story house. A one-and-a-half also becomes a split-level house when half of the ground floor is elevated so that it is halfway between the ground floor and second floor, thereby resulting in a three-level house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the increasing cost of real estate, both the split-level house and the one-and-a-half house began to be replaced by the more spacious and practical two-story houses.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ana Maria M.

It is also known as <strong>dula-an</strong> from the Tagalog&nbsp;<em>dula</em>, meaning &ldquo;play,&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>an</em>, &ldquo;a suffix denoting place,&rdquo; and <strong>coliseo</strong>, from the Latin&nbsp;<em>colosseum</em>, meaning &ldquo;a large place for staging spectacles.&rdquo; The teatro may be an independent building or an auditorium, which could just be part of a larger structure such as a school or an office building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Spanish Colonial <strong>Period</strong></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Teatro&rdquo; was the name given to the structure when first introduced in the Philippines. The earliest theaters in the Philippines, known as <strong>teatros al aire libre</strong> (open-air theaters), were made up of a temporary platform surrounded by an open space for spectators. During fiestas and special occasions, there were portable stages assembled and dismantled after all the performances. It consisted mainly of the <strong>entablado</strong> (stage platform) and backstage areas; the audience section for the spectators; and the entrance lobby. Where a performance takes place is generally framed by an arch, the <strong>proscenio</strong> (proscenium), and covered by a curtain. The backstage has spaces for dressing rooms, space for scenery and equipment, workshops, and storage rooms. The audience section of old theaters was either rectangular or circular in plan, occupied by rows of seats that may be sloping on a single level or on several levels. Another type built in Arroceros and Tondo was the <strong>camarin-teatro</strong> (barn theater) of bamboo and nipa or thatch structure, a podium, and an audience section with wooden benches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the later years, the teatro adopted a trapezoidal or fan-shaped plan with the stage at the narrow end. Aisles ran between rows of seats and along the sidewalls. Seats were grouped in boxes or on tiers. The audience section was reached through a lobby. The balcony above the lobby was used as a lounge where the audience gathered for refreshments and to smoke during intermissions. The teatro may have other spaces within the building such as administrative offices, shops, and a refreshment parlor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Teatro Comico was located in the Campo de Arroceros near the Pasig River that flourished from 1780 to 1790. Tondo in 1840 was the setting of coliseos (bamboo theaters roofed with nipa) where Tagalog plays were performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two most significant permanently-built theaters were Teatro del Principe Alfonso built in 1862 and Teatro de Binondo, also known as Teatro Espa&ntilde;ol, inaugurated in 1864. Teatro de Binondo<em>,</em>first of the elegant theaters outside the walls of Intramuros, was a two-story building of stone, brick and wood with an arcaded first story, and the second level with an open colonnade, and balcony with balustrade. It was located on a site along a street parallel to Escolta, now San Vicente, between San Jacinto and Nueva Sts. It was built at a cost of 30,000 pesos sourced from the coffers of Caja de Carriedo and Obras Pias. The spacious lobby of the theater leads to a semicircular auditorium and an orchestra section with tiered seats. The seating included <strong>palcos</strong> (boxes) classified as&nbsp;<em>principales&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>segundas&nbsp;</em>(first and second class); <strong>plateas</strong> (tiered seats) on the main floor; and the <strong>tertulia</strong> or <strong>paraiso</strong> (gallery), the uppermost section. The stage is framed in a wide and pointed proscenium because of the angle of the roof. The theater soon became the hub of Manila&rsquo;s upper crust and &ldquo;the construction of the new theater has brought Manila a step closer to European civilization&rdquo; (Cari&ntilde;o 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Teatro del Principe Alfonso, later called Teatro Espa&ntilde;ol, was constructed in 1862 by Juan Barbero, a veteran stage director and actor, using light materials, largely of wood and galvanized iron. A popular venue for&nbsp;<em>sarsuwela&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>komedya</em>, it was open to all social classes. Located on the Campo de Arroceros, now the area between Quezon Bridge and MacArthur Bridge, it accommodated as much as 650 spectators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With its reputed capacity of 2,500, Teatro Circo de Bilibid, originally a bullring, was the largest in its time. It was named as such because of its circular plan, and it was located opposite the Bilibid prison. The roof was of wood and galvanized iron. It flourished in the 1870s, became a cockpit in 1880, and was destroyed by a typhoon in 1882.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar in shape to the Teatro Circo de Bilibid was the Teatro de Novedades, later known as Teatro de Variedades. It was originally an octagonal pavilion for public dances and was converted to a theater in 1878. It was located opposite the Teatro del Principe Alfonso.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the Pasig, at the corner of Calle San Roque and Calle General Echague, was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3296\">Teatro Filipino</a> built in 1880. It was constructed as a rectangular building of wood with galvanized iron roof. It had only one tier of boxes, the best of which were near the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considered the most celebrated in its time was the Teatro Circo Zorrilla, named after the Spanish poet and playwright Jose Zorrilla y Moral. Inaugurated in 1893, the theater was located at the corner of the Calzada de Iris and Calle San Pedro, now bounded by Recto Ave, Quezon Blvd, and Calle Evangelista. The circular hall accommodated 1,352 spectators, four of whom could sit in the <strong>palcos de honor</strong> (box of honor), 48 in palcos arranged in tiers, 400 in the&nbsp;<em>butacas&nbsp;</em>(orchestra seats), and 900 in the&nbsp;<em>galeria </em>(general admission section). The Zorrilla was the venue for sarsuwela, opera, drama, concerts, and silent movies. It was demolished in 1936 and its site is now occupied by Isetann Mall of Quiapo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teatro Tagalo de Tondo or Coliseo de Tondo prospered from 1840 to 1890 and was originally a structure of bamboo and nipa, with a facade of <strong>sawali</strong>, later of wood with galvanized iron roof. Other theaters were the Teatro Infantil de Dulumbayan that was 24 m wide and 34 m long. The stage had a nipa roof, and wood and bamboo floor. It had 14 palcos, 30 butacas, 12 seats in the orchestra pit, and a five-tiered galeria with bamboo seats. The Teatro Gui&ntilde;ol was 6 m wide and 14 m long, without roof and demountable for easy transport. A Franciscan Friar Cipriano Gomez established the only true opera house of the 19th century in Pandacan, sometime in 1887. The theater was exclusively for opera performed by native singers who were trained by an Italian teacher. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\">Ladislao Bonus</a> was the conductor of the orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even during the Spanish era, schools encouraged the dramatic arts and promoted theater and similar functions to enhance the confidence of students and to train them in rhetoric and eloquence. Schools had a <strong>salon de actos</strong>, an auditorium, which could be used for dramatic performances. In the salon of Ateneo was enacted Jose Rizal&rsquo;s <strong><em>Junto al Pasig</em></strong> (On the Banks of the Pasig), a short play to celebrate the Virgin of Antipolo&rsquo;s fluvial procession through the Pasig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The American Colonial Period</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The durable <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Manila Grand </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">Opera House</a>&nbsp;was built in 1902 and followed the traditional design, with tiers of boxes around the audience section. The First Philippine Assembly was inaugurated on 16 Oct 1907 in this theater. The building was burned during World War II but later rebuilt like a cinema-style auditorium. Most movie stars of the 1950s and 1960s started their career in the post-war Manila Grand Opera House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Occupying the forefront of art deco style in the Philippines was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> built in the 19th-century theater district along Arroceros, in Plaza Lawton. Inaugurated in 1931, it marked Arellano&rsquo;s deviation from his Beaux Arts lineage. The facade of the Metropolitan could be likened to a stage whose focal point was a framed, proscenium-like central window of stained glass that corresponded in scale and in shape to the theater proscenium inside. This window was emphasized on both sides by curving walls that were lavishly decorated with tapestries of colored tiles reminiscent of traditional Southeast Asian batik patterns. The entrance doors had grillwork resembling stylized birds of paradise (Lico 2008, 336).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theater proper could be accessed through a wide foyer which had a two-story semi-vaulted ceiling and was flanked on both sides by wide marble stairways leading to the loge and balcony. Two mural paintings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>, <strong><em>The Dance</em></strong> and <strong><em>History of Music</em></strong>, were placed above the stair landings on the second floor. Moderne statues by Italian sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\">Francesco Monti</a> enhanced the opulence of the lobby. The space above the proscenium was an exquisite setting for bas-relief figures allegorically depicting Music, Tragedy, Comedy, and Poetry, while a cascade of silver jewel-like plaques adorned both sides of the proscenium. It was designed for plays, opera, symphony concerts, and cinema. The orchestra, loge, and balcony of the auditorium could accommodate a 1,670 audience. Stylized from Philippine vegetation and wildlife, the motifs were executed with the assistance of Arellano&rsquo;s elder brother Arcadio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a>, the leading decorative sculptor of the day. The building was destroyed in the 1945 World War II battle for liberation and was not restored until 1978 under the supervision of Otillo Arellano, Juan Arellano&rsquo;s nephew (Lico 2008, 338).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the American era, two school-based theaters, both in art deco, were well known in Manila: St Cecilia&rsquo;s Music Hall and the Ateneo Theater. In 1906, the same year the Benedictine sisters established St. Scholastica College, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3901\">Sr Baptista Battig</a>, OSB, a student of the German composer and pianist Franz Liszt and an accomplished concert pianist before joining the Benedictines, founded a conservatory of music. St Cecilia&rsquo;s was built as a venue for student concerts at St. Scholastica&rsquo;s which were much awaited social events. Designed by Andres Luna de San Pedro in the style of the Egyptian art deco and completed in 1932, St Cecilia gave the concerts a noble home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Sr Battig was the moving force behind St Cecilia&rsquo;s, American Jesuit Lee Henry Irwin was the one behind the Ateneo Theater. He taught at the Ateneo de Manila as a scholastic in 1922 and 1923, and he staged <strong><em>Julius Caesar</em></strong> in 1922. He returned to the United States to complete his studies and 10 years later, returned to Manila. Upon assuming his position as Grade School Headmaster, Irwin started mounting plays like <strong><em>King Lear</em></strong>. Under his encouragement, the Ateneo built a theater which was designed by Ateneo alumnus Juan Nakpil and completed in 1936. The theater which had a capacity of about 800 was famous for its acoustics. It had an orchestra pit and 19 dressing rooms, a very deep stage with four prosceniums. Irwin then introduced Manila to a program of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays. With the assistance of Jesuit scholastics, the annual passion play was mounted for Lent. It drew a large following, including Manila&rsquo;s high society and government officials, including Pres Manuel Quezon. The theater, like St Cecilia&rsquo;s, was damaged during World War II, but unlike the latter, it was never rebuilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The school auditorium, which also served as a theater venue, was a standard for schools before World War II. Far Eastern College (now a university), designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>, built art deco buildings along Quezon Ave, in 1939; the FEU Theater housed the administration building.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Period of the Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the post-World War II era, theaters continued to be built. In 1958, the Jose Rizal Centennial Commission presented the plan to build a National Shrine composed of a national theater, national library and museum at the Wallace Field in Luneta. The centerpiece for this project was to be Juan Nakpil&rsquo;s National Theater designed in 1959, an edifice that would have combined concrete folded plate and spherical thin shell roof to achieve a sculptural and monumental effect. But the National Theater failed to be constructed on Wallace Field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a revised plan and simpler scheme than those of the national theater, Nakpil designed the Rizal Theater. It was the first theater in Makati and the centerpiece of Makati Commercial Center planned by the Ayala Company as part of an extensive urban development plan. Although normally used as a movie house, it had a large stage suitable for ballets and musicals. The auditorium had one sloping floor with orchestra, loge, and balcony forming one vast space. Unfortunately it was demolished in the 1980s to make way for Shangri-La Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located on a 35-hectare site in Cubao, Quezon City, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\">Araneta Coliseum</a>, built 1957-59, was an engineering achievement during its time. Between the years 1960-63, it reigned as the biggest domed coliseum in the world. The coliseum was constructed of reinforced concrete cylinder, with an aluminum dome structure having a diameter of 108 m. The dome was made of steel with 48 main ribs meeting in a compression ring that floated high above the floor. The dome was suspended 10 stories or 36.8 m above the arena floor, which itself had an area of 2.3 ha. It has been one of the largest clear span dome in the world and the largest indoor facility in Southeast Asia for sometime.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Theaters in the 1960s were a challenge to the creativity of the architect. When the Insular Life moved from Binondo to Makati in 1962, the Ayala Companies built what was then the tallest building along Ayala Ave, exceeding the 30 m limit of older buildings. Designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2646\">Cesar Concio</a>, Insular Life was noted for its rounded corner, its expressive use of sun baffles, and the bas-relief mural by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>. Also well known was Insular Life Theater, located on the upper floor of the central building. Although built for corporate events, its stage was adaptable to theater productions. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a>, established in 1967, adapted Insular as the venue for Broadway productions, linking Insular and Repertory in the popular mind. Greenhills Theater, completed in 1968 and designed by Antonio Heredia, was the first structure to use the technology of post-tension structural system that allowed a clear span 52 m and 6 m overhang and allowed the structure to &ldquo;move with the earth&rdquo; to reduce the disastrous effect of an earthquake. Acoustic engineering, lighting design, and sightlines of the audience were primary considerations for most of the theaters built during this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most popular venue for quality concerts in the 1960s and 1970s was the ground-floor theater of Philam-Life Building on United Nations Ave which was known for its quality acoustics. Designed by Architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2635\">Carlos Arguelles</a>, the theater orchestra had side walls lined with carved murals, while the wide theater lobby was dominated by a stained glass sarimanok by Galo Ocampo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Meralco Building, 1968, was designed by Architect Jose Maria V. Zaragoza. Located on Ortigas Ave, the 14-story building was known for the Meralco Theater on its ground floor. Plays, operas, musicals, ballets, and concerts have graced its spacious stage. It had the first revolving stage and its seating gently sloped so that what would have been the balcony section flowed into the orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inaugurated in 1969, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>&rsquo; (CCP) Theater of the Performing Arts houses the Tanghalang Nicanor S. Abelardo (formerly the Main Theater), 1,805-seater; Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a> (formerly the Little Theater), a 402-seater; and Tanghalang Huseng Batute (formerly Bulwagang Gantimpala), an experimental space which seats a maximum of 250. It also houses art galleries, a museum, rehearsal rooms, and offices. Tanghalang Nicanor S. Abelardo has an orchestra section, parterre boxes, two balconies, and two tiers of side boxes as well as a large orchestra pit. The Theater of the Performing Arts is the work of National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Leandro V. Locsin</a>. He worked with the finest technical team consisting of structural engineer Alfredo L. Juinio, constructor David M. Consunji, acoustical consultants Bolt, Beranek and Newman, mechanical and electro-systems consultants and others to create a venue that gave splendid quality to all the performances in this theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The CCP complex rises prominently on reclaimed land along Roxas Blvd. Another structure that is part of the complex is the Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas, better known as Folk Arts Theater. Designed by Locsin, it is an arena-type, thousand-seat theater constructed within an incredibly short period for the Miss Universe Pageant in 1974. It was in use for pop concerts and other big productions until the 1990s when it had to close for major repairs. Since then the theater has been leased out to the public. A lessee, Day by Day Christian Ministries, rented the place in 2005, calling it Bulwagan ng Panginoon (Hall of the Lord). The Manila Film Center nearby, built in 1982 for the Manila International Film Festival, was damaged by an earthquake in 1990. It was ordered closed and remains unused, except occasionally when it is rented out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also designed by Locsin was the National Arts Center, 1976, at Mt Makiling, Los Ba&ntilde;os for the National High School for the Arts. The huge theater has a pyramidal roof over an audience section that is open on three sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, as the Philippines faced the problem of political, social, and economic recovery, some performing arts venues started to deteriorate for lack of maintenance and lack of viable activities. The Metropolitan Theater, restored in 1978, went into an economic downspin as income plummeted. Restored with a loan from GSIS, the building was sequestered for being unable to service its debt. Left idle, the building deteriorated. In 2015, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, exercising its right of first refusal on the sale of cultural treasures as mandated in the National Heritage Act, took over this heritage building. It got approval from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to purchase the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1990s, new theaters were built, which were equipped with the latest devices in stage technology. The AFP Theater in Camp Aguinaldo is a fully-equipped venue built ca 1996. It has a capacity of 1,074. While it serves the needs of the army camp, it is also rented out to the public. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\">Carlos P. Romulo</a> Auditorium in RCBC Plaza, designed by Fisher Dachs Associates, Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill, W.V. Cosculluela &amp; Associates, is a multipurpose venue for corporate activities and for performances. It seats 450. Construction of RCBC began in 1996 and was completed in 2001. The auditorium is suited for smaller productions, although musicals have been successfully staged in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resort&rsquo;s World Theater is located inside the Resort&rsquo;s World Manila in Newport City, beside the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 3. A joint venture between Alliance Global Group and Genting Hong Kong, the complex was inaugurated in stages, beginning with a soft launch on 28 Aug 2009. The theater is in the restaurant and cinema wing, connected to the hotel and casino by a wide corridor flanked by retail stores. The theater is known for its wide stage and its state-of-the-art stage equipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mall of Asia Arena is a multipurpose indoor arena which can seat 16,000 to 20,000. It is a flexible arena which can be configured for sports, its primary use, but also for religious events, like the visit of Pope Francis in Jan 2015 and entertainment events like rock concerts. The arena was opened on 16 Jun 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solaire Theater in the Solaire Resort and Casino Complex, completed in 2013, is described as a lyrical theater. With a capacity of 1,760, the fan-shaped theater employs Constellation Acoustic System created by Meyer Sound which has the ability to alter the acoustical properties of the hall to suit the requirements of different types of local and international performances such as Broadway musicals, operas, concertos, and ballets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>School-based theater became an even more important phenomenon after the war. Many schools rebuilt, refurbished or built theaters in their compounds. St Cecilia of St Scholastica&rsquo;s College was rebuilt. Another important theater was the Fleur de lis Auditorium in St Paul College, Manila, which was known for plays in which students of St Paul&rsquo;s and the neighboring boys&rsquo; schools, the Ateneo de Manila on Padre Faura St and De La Salle College on Taft Ave, would participate. Here, Fr James Reuter, SJ staged notable plays and musicals. The auditorium was inaugurated on 12 Dec 1957 and came to be known as the &ldquo;Broadway on Herran&rdquo; because of its musical productions. Fleur de lis was designed by Jose L. Reynoso. National Artist Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco painted the 3.5 by 4.5 mural, <strong><em>Evolution of Philippine Culture</em></strong>, which was ready for the theater&rsquo;s grand opening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, St Joseph&rsquo;s College Mater Dei Auditorium was a popular venue in Quezon City. St Joseph&rsquo;s, a school run by the Franciscan Sisters for the growing community of New Manila, Kamuning, and San Juan, opened in 1932. It was abruptly closed during World War II but reopened in 1948. The Mater Dei Auditorium was built after World War II behind the main building of St Joseph&rsquo;s. The annual play held at the auditorium was an event that drew a large audience. Zenaida Amador was the director of many of these plays. She mounted Broadway musicals here until she established Repertory Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until 2004, the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) mounted its performances at the open-air Dulaang Rajah Sulayman in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>. That same year, construction for the PETA Theater Center began. Inaugurated in 2006, the PETA Theater Center in Eymard Drive, New Manila, Quezon City is now the venue for PETA&rsquo;s productions and is also leased to independent theater groups. Its black box theater, known as the PETA Phinma Theater, has an adjustable stage and audience arrangement. &ldquo;It may be an Arena, an End Stage, or Thrust Stage using various platforms, thrusts, ramps and extensions as imagined or required by each production&rdquo; (PETA Phinma Theater 2016). Depending on the stage and audience arrangement, the theater can accommodate anywhere from 400 to 450 people. The PETA Theater Center also has a library (known as Lia Sciortino and O&rsquo;ong Maryono Resource Center), two studios which serve as rehearsal space and a multipurpose venue, a roofdeck that can also be used as venue for intimate performances, and two halls&mdash;the PETA Smart Exhibition Hall and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> Hall&mdash;which are also multifunctional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman Campus has a number of theaters. Abelardo Hall, the music hall of the Conservatory of Music, was built from 1960 to 1963. Architect Roberto Novenario designed it, following the International Style which used honeycomb sun baffles as brise-soleil. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a> Theater at Palma Hall, the home of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>, was designed and refurbished from the existing auditorium that was built with the rest of Palma Hall after World War II. Other theaters in UP are the UP Theater (also known as Villamor Hall) and Aldaba Hall at the back of the UP Theater, Teatro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> at the Faculty Center which was gutted down by fire in 2016, and Cine Adarna of the UP Film Insitute Film Center, which is dedicated to cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, Ateneo moved to Quezon City and did not have a large theater like the one in Padre Faura. So in the 1950s and 1960s, plays were mounted in multipurpose auditoriums in the Grade School and College and in the High School covered courts. In 1956, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3142\">Onofre Pagsanghan</a> established the Ateneo High School Dramatics Society, which was renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a> in 1966. For many years this theater group did not have a theater of its own but performed in classrooms with improvised lights made of recycled tin cans and par lamps, until Dulaang Sibol theater, renamed Tanghalang Onofre Pagsanghan, was built in the 1980s. Ateneo also built the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3005\">Henry Lee Irwin</a> Theater in the 1980s, a 1,200-seater beside the Ateneo Grade School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the better-known school-based theaters are concentrated in the National Capital Region. Thus, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a>&rsquo;s Claire Isabel Mc Gill Luce Auditorium built in 1973 and completed in 1975 stands as an exception. It is considered the largest and most fully equipped theater outside Metro Manila. In 2008, work on upgrading the theater was completed with a grant from the Luce Foundation, which initially sponsored its construction. Shaped as a sculptural block with the lower portion truncated at the facade to make way for the glass-enclosed entrance, the upper portion of the structure serves as canopy and foyer to the theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The College of Saint Benilde&rsquo;s School of Design and Arts houses a theater built as a structure that juts out of the facade in a daring cantilever. The theater also serves as the canopy for the main entrance. The theater and school complex, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2641\">Ed Calma</a> in the deconstructionist postmodern idiom, was completed in 2007.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>tree house</strong>, built either on tree stumps or limbs, has become a rarity in the country. Early 20th century anthropologists and travelers have documented it as existing only in a few parts of northern Luzon among such groups as the Bugkalot (Ilongot) and the Gaddang, in north-central Mindanao among the Bukidnon, and in some areas in eastern Mindanao among the Manobo of Agusan and the Mandaya of Davao. It was usually found in places where violent intercommunity strifes and night attacks were frequent. Occasionally, it was a practical solution to frequent flooding in low-lying areas and to wild animals prowling at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the earliest accounts of the tree house was written by the Frenchman Paul de la Gironiere in the early 19th century. Writing about the dwelling and settlement patterns of the Tinguian of Palan, northwest Abra, he noted that the Tinguian had a day and a night abode. The day abode was a typical bamboo and straw hut of modest proportions, while the night abode called <strong>alligang</strong> was even smaller and was perched high on a tree top, about 18-24 m above ground, as a precaution against surprise nocturnal attacks of the Guinana, their archenemy.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1913, Fay Cooper Cole wrote on the tree houses of the Mandaya of Mindanao. Cole noted two types of tree houses: firstly, those that rest &ldquo;on the limbs of trees, conforming in size and shape to the nature of the supporting branches,&rdquo; and secondly, those built on trees whose crowns had been &ldquo;cut off some 4.5 or 6 m above the ground leaving the stump to serve as a part of the foundation.&rdquo; Houses of the first type had sloping roofs and some did not have sidewalls. For those without horizontal sides, the roofs sloped directly from a central ridgepole to the edges of the platform, making the sidewalls unnecessary. In the second type, many smaller poles were added to support the flooring and also to extend the space upward to form the framework for both the walls and the roof. Either type of house was entered by means of a notched pole or a bamboo or rattan ladder which was drawn up at night to prevent illegal entries and surprise attacks by warring groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tree house is often located on the edge of cliffs and can be approached only from one direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although fragile in appearance, the Mandaya tree house could endure even the worst storms; the whole house may move and creak with each strong wind but it always remains safely in place. Using no nails nor hardware, the structure is firmly lashed together with rattan, and during turbulent weather, further secured by anchoring the house with the help of strong vines to nearby trees. Despite its limited size, this house can also accommodate two to three families living together. As by custom, suitors and husbands of married daughters reside with the women&rsquo;s folk.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Several other tribal groups are reported to have tree houses, namely, the Gaddang of northern Luzon, whose thatched-pile dwellings are built right into the high-forked branches of a tree; some members of the Higaonon tribe of Bukidnon, whose swaying high-rise dwellings are connected by a wobbly catwalk to a central communal room; the Bugkalot, whose houses are scattered and concealed in the forest, fenced with fallen trees and thorny bamboo, and approached by way of a hidden entrance; and other groups like the Tiruray, the Manobo, and the Aeta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A further development of the tree house concept may be seen in houses propped up on poles as tall as trees in elevations ranging from 6 to 18 meters above the ground among such peoples as the Blaan. The aforementioned groups, however, also maintain other types of piled dwellings, moving to the tree house only during critical periods when defense is important.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

		"text": "<p>During the Spanish era, the <strong>tribunal</strong> or <strong>casa tribunal</strong>, usually built along or near the plaza, which fronted the church, was the town&rsquo;s court of law. It was also known as <strong>corte</strong> (court) and <strong>juzgado</strong> (judge&rsquo;s sala).The analogue of the tribunal in Manila,</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The colonial capital, was the <strong>audiencia</strong>. The term referred both to the body of justices constituting the supreme court of the archipelago and the building where they held their sessions. Audiencia referred also to the process of litigation where a hearing was done. The justices had their own building across the Palacio del Gobernador at the site presently occupied by a fire department along Aduana St, presently A. Soriano.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A feature that distinguished the casa tribunal from the <strong>casa real</strong> (royal house) was the presence of a <strong>calabozo</strong> (jail), usually on the first floor of the two-story structure or in the most secure area of a one-story structure. The two-story casa tribunal did not differ much from the <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (stone house) except that some tribunal, were made entirely of stone and had balconies jutting out of the facade. The one-story type was similar to the schoolhouse. When a town had no casa tribunal, the casa real or the convento in the church complex served as tribunal, hence the stories about friars imprisoning and punishing dissidents in the convento.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>A development of the calabozo in the tribunal was the construction of penal institutions and colonies during the 19th century, the best examples of which are Bilibid in Manila, the <strong>carcel</strong> in Cebu, and San Ramon in Zamboanga. Another common penal practice during this century was deportation to Mindanao, Paragua (now Palawan) or the Marianas. Deportation had a double purpose: punishment and the creation of communities in areas not under Spanish rule. Prisoners&mdash;whether criminals, vagabonds, prostitutes, or political dissidents&mdash;were housed in <strong>bahay kubo</strong> (nipa hut) settlements organized by the civil government. In some cases, areas of deportation were disorganized. Deportees were simply sent to a place and left to fend for themselves, building whenever and however they pleased. Missionaries sent to Mindanao found many settlements disorganized. They took the initiative of organizing the towns, following the norms of colonial town planning. They laid out streets in a grid, designated sites for the church, plaza, casa real, and tribunal and standardized the size of home lots. Areas in Mindanao where deportees were sent were Dapitan, famous for being the place of exile of Jose Rizal from 1892 to 1896, Davao, and Surigao.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>tsalet</strong>, which comes from the French word <strong>chalet</strong>, meaning &ldquo;sheltered place,&rdquo; originally referred to the Swiss peasant house characterized by a steep roof, an ornamented gable, and upper floors projecting over the lower ones. In the Philippines the term is used for the compactly planned, one-story suburban house that appeared during the early decades of the 20th century. The tsalet could also be a two-story structure with living quarters on the upper floor or a one-story house elevated above the ground. The house embodied principles of tropical architecture popularized by the government architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a>. The one-story house, like the <strong>bahay kubo</strong> (nipa hut), was raised 50 cm or more above the ground to avoid the humidity of the earth. The first floor of the two-story house, like that of the <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (stone house) was an empty space. Concrete was used for its foundations and piers. A prominent feature was the veranda built in front of the house or on three sides of it which was often adorned with carved railings. Entrance to the house was through a simple set of stairs at the very center of the house facade, or through an L- or T-shaped concrete or wooden stairway. Stairs were usually concrete but could also be of wood. The house, made of wood, had large windows, a departure from those of the Swiss prototype which were small and hung as casements. Neither was its galvanized iron roof as low pitched nor as largely projected at the eaves as in the continental variety. Instead the roof had vents to allow the free flow of air, thus cooling the structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Compared with the older bahay na bato, the tsalet was simple, comfortable, and not ostentatious, although some used decorative elements like lattice work and carved transoms. Planned as a quadrilateral, the tsalet had the amenities of modern living: a living room, dining room, kitchen, bedrooms, and bathrooms. The tsalet, often built in a lot with trees and flower gardens, was a comfortable home for the urbanized middle class that emerged and grew under the American colonial period. There were different variations&mdash;that is, with adaptations of the continental, American (the log-cabin type), and native models, and with some local details. In Metro Manila, the tsalet can still be found in the Paco and Malate districts of Manila, in Pasay City, and in San Juan City where Cafe Ysabel is located.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Monica P.

		"text": "<p>The tulay, also known as <strong>taytay</strong> or <strong>puente</strong>, is a bridge&mdash;that is, a horizontal structure that provides passage between two points separated by a depression, a body of water, or a thoroughfare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the turn of the 19th century, American engineers documented elaborate indigenous bridges. One built over a river on the Carigara-Barugo Road in Leyte consisted of dressed wood beams and planks and had a geometrically designed wooden handrail and a nipa roof. Indigenous Philippine bridges are constructed out of pliant but sturdy materials like bamboo and coconut trunks. The Mandaya of Davao Oriental connect their houses built above bamboo marshes with bamboo bridges without handrails. Even today, the bamboo or coconut bridge is found in areas where the government has not yet built suitable infrastructure. Tall bamboo poles or coconut trunks are lashed together to form the piers of the bridge. The number of piers depends on the distance to be spanned. The piers support girders, which in turn carry the bamboo poles that form the passage. The bridge may have a handrail, often to one side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spanish Colonial Era</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stone bridges were introduced by the Spaniards in the Philippines. While the Spanish colonial era is identified with the iconic church, <strong>convento</strong>, and fortifications, it was also a time when great effort was exerted to open land routes to gain access to the highlands and remote areas of the country and to complement the sea and riverine routes, the time-tested way of reaching towns and settlements. A good number of friars were responsible for building these land routes which had bridges traversing waterways and chasms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Augustinian bridge builders were Fr Andres Pati&ntilde;o, who linked Malabon and Tinajeros, and Fr Francisco Valencia, who linked Malabon with Navotas. Frs Ramon Sanchez, Benito Varas, Ramon del Marco, Celestino Mayordomo, and Raymundo Cortazar worked in Batangas, especially in Lipa, Tanauan, and Taal. Frs Buzeta, an author, Melchor Fernandez, and Antonio Piernavieja built bridges in Bulacan. Fr Juan Tombo connected San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan with Gapan, Nueva Ecija. Along Luzon&rsquo;s western coast, Frs Rufino Redondo, Evaristo Guadalupe, and Antonio Jorda worked in Ilocos. Fr Jose Coruguedo linked Narvacan with Abra. As early as 1579, a year after they arrived in Manila, Franciscans were busy building roads and bridges in Laguna. A pioneer was Fr Francisco de Gata. A Franciscan brother, Lorenzo de Santa Maria, assisted the priests by opening roads to link the Franciscan missions. Fr De la Parilla built a bridge in Baras, Rizal and laid out the six principal streets of the town. Fr Jose Fernandez connected Dulag with Tanauan in Leyte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesuits were known as builders of churches, residences, and colleges but their work in infrastructure has not been sufficiently studied. Two names come up as builders: Fr Antonio Sede&ntilde;o and Fr Diego Garcia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dominicans had a reputation for being builders of roads and bridges that lasted. Two well-known friars are Frs Manuel del Rio and Juan Villaverde who opened a way to the Cagayan Valley from Pangasinan and Nueva Ecija. The mountain trail between Malionliong, Pangasinan, through the Central Cordillera then reaching Ituy Valley of Nueva Vizcaya, and continuing to Gamu, Isabela was the work of Fr del Rio. Completed in 1739, this roadway passed through hostile territory and was later on abandoned. In the 19th century, Fr Villaverde created a mountain trail now named after him&mdash;the Villaverde Pass in northern Luzon. He also linked Nueva Vizcaya with Kiangan via Bagabag; Ibung via Solano, Nueva Vizcaya; and Aritao, Nueva Vizcaya and San Nicolas, Pangasinan. Frs Manuel Corripio worked on the roads of Dupax, Francisco Carrozal built the road system of Solano, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2669\">Antonio Lobato</a> built roads and bridges in Tuguegarao. In Pangasinan, Frs Eugenio Minguez built the Sual-Zambales road; Gabriel Perez the Lingayen-Salasa road; Quiros y Domingo Taboada, the Mangaldan-Santa Barbara road; and Gaspar de Castro a link road between San Jacinto de Cauili and Manaoag. Fr Ramon Agustin built the road linking Manaog and Binalonan. In Batanes, two bridges at Ivana were built by Fr Nicolas Casta&ntilde;o.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Recollects had Frs Simon de San Agustin who built the bridge linking Quiapo with San Sebastian; Marcial Bellido who linked Masinloc with Palawig in Zambales; Celestino Yoldi who built the road to San Juan de Bolboc, Batangas; and Lucas de Jesus Maria who built the Calle Rosario near the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a. Fr Matias Carbonell built Puente Isabel II near the Recollect hacienda at Imus. For this deed, Fr Carbonell was honored by acting Gov-Gen Ramon Montero in 1857 (Noche 2011, 17-20).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Civil engineering came to the Philippines in the middle of the 19th century when the Inspeccion General de Caminos y Canales was organized in 1799 during the reign of Carlos IV of Spain. By 1834, the Escuela de Ingeniera Civil was organized in Spain, which provided training and education for engineers prior to posting in Spain or in the colonies. The corps in charge of building was known as Cuerpo de Ingenieros de Caminos, Canales, y Puertos. In the Philippines, the Inspeccion General de Obras Publicas was established in 1866 and was subsumed under the Dirrecion General de Administracion Civil. Engineers who worked for Obas Publicas were Manuel Ramirez Bazan, Castro Olano, Genaro Palacios, Eduardo Lopez Navarro, and Damian Quero. Complementing the work of civil engineers were military engineers like Francisco de Castro Ponte, Carlos de las Heras, Rafael Quevedo, and Agustin Lopez Maroto (Noche 2011, 21-2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bridges built during the Spanish era followed a traditional method of construction using stone arches. This method of construction can be traced back to the ancient Romans but enjoyed resurgence during the Renaissance when more and more infrastructure was built in Europe and then in the European colonies in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. To build arched bridges, the piers had to be built first and this involved building a temporary coffer dam where the pier was to be placed. Then a stone and mortar structure with deep foundations was built. The type of stonework and mortaring used in the construction of churches, homes, the <strong>casa real</strong> (royal house), wall, and other colonial buildings was also used for bridges. Once the piers were set, a wooden form in the shape of a semicircular arch was laid, linking one pier to another. The cut stones that formed the arch were laid over the form and linked using mortar. The bridge was then waterproofed using a sand and mortar layer called <strong>palitada</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noche&rsquo;s documentation (2011) of Spanish era bridges shows the extent of bridge building during the Spanish colonial era. Some bridges are still in place and in use, but some are known only through documentation and photographs. Some have survived, at least partially, often hidden from view because they have been overlaid with a new roadbed. What follows is a quick survey of bridges Noche documented and arranged geographically, with Manila as the hub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Manila</strong>. The walled city of Intramuros was surrounded by a moat, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> was cut off from the city by a moat. Intramuros bridges led to the principal gates of Intramuros, some passing through ravellins before arriving at the gate. While the Intramuros bridges were made of stone, the portion closest to the wall was a wooden drawbridge that was lifted to seal the city. A nightly curfew was imposed so that inhabitants had to be inside the walled city before the drawbridges were raised at 11 at night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1772, Puente del Fuerza de Santiago was built slightly west of Fort Santiago&rsquo;s main gate. Puente de Puerta del Parian, 1782, connected to the Revellin del Parian, which in turn had Puente del Revell&iacute;n del Parian, 1814. Designed by Mariano de Ocampo, Puente del Fuerza connected with the Escolta, a road that linked the north and south banks of the Pasig through a bridge. Puente de la Puerta Real de Bagumbayan was built to connect the new Puerta Real built after the British occupation, 1762-64. It connected with Puente Durmiente, 1784, that arches into the Revellin de Bagumbayan (Noche 2011, 52-60). Beyond the walls of Intramuros, Manila was divided into north and south and bisected by the Pasig River. An early stone bridge vital to the life of Intramuros and the neighboring districts was the Puente Grande de Espa&ntilde;a built in 1630. It spanned the south and north banks of the Pasig River (Noche 2011, 32). Located east of the site presently occupied by Jones Bridge, the bridge consisted of elliptical arches of stone resting on massive stone piers. In the course of its history, the bridge was renovated a number of times in the 19th century: in 1814 under Domingo Ildefonso de Aragon, the leading civil engineer of the era; in 1824 when two of the original ten arches were removed; and in 1859 when stone railings were replaced by wood and marble resting places for the convenience of pedestrians. Four years later, the bridge collapsed and was replaced by a pontoon bridge designed by Pedro Lopez Esguerra. The original bridge was never rebuilt but instead was replaced by the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Puente de Espa&ntilde;a, erected in 1875, had six spans of masonry and two of iron. Puente de Espa&ntilde;a was almost perfectly aligned with Puente Grande and its south approach was almost side by side with the bridge it was replacing. However, the north approach diverged. Puente Grande landed on Plaza de San Gabriel (now Plaza Moraga) while Puente de Espa&ntilde;a landed on Nueva, now Yuchengco (Noche 2011, 35-36).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanning the Pasig was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/363\">Puente Colgante</a> which connected the old Parian (also Arocerros) with Quiapo. It was also known as Puente de Claveria, in honor of Gov-Gen Narciso de Claveria. It was the second bridge to be built across the Pasig. This toll bridge was a technological innovation because it was a suspension bridge that used steel and steel cable. Erected in 1852, it was the project of a private company, Matias, Mechacatorre y Cia. Construction was entrusted to a French engineer named M. Gaband, and the steel parts were imported from England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a suspension bridge, Colgante consisted of two tall concrete towers built on either side of the Pasig. A pair of stout cables hung from the piers and were anchored to the north and south banks. Smaller cables were hung from these stout cables and supported the roadway which was a trussed bridge. Steel railings flanked the bridge, and iron street lamps provided illumination. Built for human and<em>calesa</em>or horse carriage traffic, the bridge survived the earthquake of 1863 and was for more than a decade the only link between north and south Manila. The bridge laste<sub>d</sub>to the 1920s when it was replaced by the art deco Quiapo Bridge, later renamed Quezon Bridge (Noche 2011, 39). Suspension bridges were built in other parts of the Philippines where piers could not be sunk into the riverbed, such as during the campaign to conquer Mindanao in the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puente de Santa Cruz connected Santa Cruz with the southern bank. Begun during the Spanish era, it was completed during the American era. Carlos de Heras designed the bridge with a reinforcing truss at the center. This allowed for a more stable and wider bridge. The bridge was damaged during World War II and was replaced by a flat deck bridge known as McArthur (Noche 2011, 43).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puente de la Convalesencia, built in 1880, had two parts. The first part landed at Isla de Convalesencia, now home to Hospicio de San Jose; the second part started from Isla to San Miguel district. Initially, the bridge was made of wood, but it was replaced by a steel bridge now popularly known as Ayala Bridge because it was the project of the Ayala y Compa&ntilde;ia. The bridge had the central steel sections manufactured by the company of Gustave Eiffel in France. Eiffel is famous for the tower named after him. Eduardo Lopez Navarro designed the bridge which connected Paco and San Miguel. It collapsed in 1890, and the government decided to build Santa Cruz bridge to replace it (Noche 2011, 40).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puente de Blanco, also Puente de Binondo, and Puente de Meisic are both in Chinatown along Ongpin St. The first is closer to the Binondo Church, but both have all but disappeared under later additions. Puente de Binondo traces to a structure built in 1796 although it is uncertain how much of this bridge survives. It spans the Estero de Binondo. Puente de Meisic spans estero de Magdalena (Noche 2011, 48-51).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Acueducto de Carriedo, built in 1883, carried neither human nor vehicular traffic but supported the large iron pipes that brought water from Marikina River and the springs of San Juan to a covered reservoir called El Deposito. This reservoir, which was near the present-day San Juan City Hall, then brought the water to Manila. The whole <strong>acueducto</strong> (aqueduct) was named after Francisco de Carriedo, mayor of Manila, who in the 18th century left an endowment of 10,000 pesos for a water works for the city. It took more than a century for the project to get underway. Today, small sections of the aqueduct exist; some are overgrown, while others are occupied by informal settlers (Noche 2011, 47).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puentes de Ferrocarril is a generic name of bridges built as part of the Plano General de los Ferrocarriles del Norte de Filipinas (Master Plan for the Railroad of Northern Philippines) prepared in the 1870s by military engineers Juan D. Barry, Manuel Saenz de Peralta, and Luciano Maria Bremon. The plan called for a network that would link Manila with Laoag, the first phase of which was a link to Dagupan. In 1875, a royal decree defined the rules governing the concession, construction, and operation of the railway. Eduardo Lopez Navarro as director of the Obras Publicas was appointed to implement the project. The plan called for laying down 1,730 km of track through provinces known for its rich agricultural output and growing population. A spur from Quingua, Bulacan would bring the railroad to Cabanatuan which would then connect with Cagayan Valley in the future. A plan to run south to Bicol was also planned. Except for the Manila-Dagupan line, the rest of the plan remained unimplemented because of the Philippine Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of bridges of this system survived World War II. One was the Puente de Ferrocarril de Labangan at Calumpit, Bulacan, which was recently demolished. Edward Sykes of London was awarded the concession to build the railway in 1887, but the following year it was transferred to Jorge Higgins Wellfith, representing the Manila Railway Co. Ltd., an English registered company. On 8 Jul 1887, Don Carlos E. de Bertodano arrived in Manila to inaugurate construction. On 31 Jul, the cornerstone for the Tutuban Station was laid, and work began. Most of the construction materials were imported&mdash;railroad ties and bridge timbers came from Australia, and Portland cement, rails, switches, track spikes and bolts, bridges, and cast iron caissons were from England. Bertodano supervised construction initially until taken ill and replaced by Horace Higgins. The bridges followed British lattice design for the spans. Piers were set up by sinking 6 ft x 6 ft drums that were bolted as they sunk. Enclosed material was dug, filled, and weighed down. If the river bed was soft, piles were first driven into it before the piers were erected. At the ends of the bridge were concrete piers reinforced by stone masonry. The bridge at Calumpit represents the type of bridge built for the railroad system (Noche 2011, 61-2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>North of Manila</strong>. Traveling northeast leads to Cagayan Valley, which for most of its history was isolated from the capital and was accessible through the Rio Grande de Cagayan, which ran through a wide plain between two mountain ranges, the Central Cordillera to the west and the Sierra Madre to the east. Dominicans evangelized the valley, traveling from Manila to Aparri then down the Rio Grande up to Ilagan, Isabela. From Ilagan, travel was through horse and river boat. Cagayan opened to land travel in the 19th century with the work of the Obras Publicas and the intrepid road-builder Fr Juan Villaverde, OP. In 1890, he opened a trail later named after him. Another well-known friar builder in Cagayan was Antonio Lobato de Santa Maria, OP. Responsible for building the church and convent of Tuguegarao, and the three <strong>hornos</strong> or kilns for firing bricks, only one of three bridges he constructed survived&mdash;Puente de Penque-Ruyu. Puente Dampol in Dupax was first constructed in 1775 under Fr Manuel Corripio, OP. In 1812, the bridge was destroyed by an earthquake; subsequently, Fr Francisco Rocamora, OP built a replacement in 1818 which still stands today. Puente de San Luis in Solano is one of the few surviving bridges built by Fr Villaverde. Named after the town patron San Luis de Beltran and planned as early as 1884, the project could not be realized immediately because Villaverde was opening the Camino de Quiangan. Villaverde finally constructed the San Luis bridge between 1884 and 1891, when he was appointed pastor of the town (Noche 2011, 109-16).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 1572, the Spaniards had entered the Ilocos. That year, Juan de Salcedo founded Ciudad Fernandina, which is now known as Vigan. The Augustinians evangelized Ilocos. In Ilocos Norte, Puente de Barit in Laoag which is along the Laoag-Bacarra National Road is made of bricks and segmented into three arches. Little is known about this bridge. Paoay, whose church of San Agustin is listed as World Heritage Site by UNESCO, has two brick bridges leading to it: Puente de Paoay on the Paoay-Currimao Road and Puentecito de Cabuyog. Considered the more beautiful and well built of the two, Puente de Paoay has a decorative parapet over a wide elliptical arch bridge. Little is known about its history. Badoc has two bridges&mdash;a large and small bridge called Puente Grande de Balaybaboy and Puente Chico. Both are made of bricks, originally covered with lime plaster. The two bridges were probably built simultaneously. Fr Antonio Estavillo, OSA, curate in the 18th century, or Fr Santiago Mu&ntilde;is, OSA, who built the Badoc convent in brick in the 1860s, are the two likely builders of these bridges. In Ilocos Sur, Puente de Santa Maria crosses the estero of the same name. The brick and bridge may have been built by Fr Juan Carda&ntilde;o, OSA, who was parish priest beginning in 1804 (Noche 2011, 117-28).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abra was a dependency of Ilocos Sur until it was erected as an independent province in 1917. In 1876, Vigan was established as an engineering district of the Obras Publicas. Eduardo Soriano was appointed district engineer. He had three assistants. There are four colonial bridges in Bangued along the streets Howard Taft, Santiago, Pe&ntilde;arubia, and Francis Burton Harrison. All made of brick and rubble, the bridges appear to have been constructed during the same period. Puente de Calle Governor Howard Taft is the most interesting of these because its railings are rendered as undulating waves meeting at the center where the semicircular parapet terminates in a bulbous finial. No data about its construction is known, but it may have been built under Soriano (Noche 2011, 129-32).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Batanes was evangelized by the Dominicans who island-hopped from Aparri in Cagayan Valley to the Babuyanes and to the Batanes Island group in 1680. By 1688, the Dominicans had left Batanes for various reasons, including the difficulty of supporting the remote island group financially. In 1719, the Dominicans returned at the initiative of Fr Juan Bel, vicar of the Babuyanes. From then on, with the support of the crown, the Dominican mission flourished so that in 1783, Batanes was recognized as colonial territory and integrated into the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dominicans were responsible for building churches, convents, and the infrastructure of the islands. They also introduced stone and mortar construction, which was adapted by vernacular architecture to create the typhoon resistant house of the native Ivatan. Puente de Ivana on the Camino Real that leads to Ivana is a triple arched structure of stone masonry. It may have been constructed during the term of Fr Nicolas Casta&ntilde;o, OP, 1798-1824. Puente de San Vicente, also in Ivana may also be the work of Fr Casta&ntilde;o or Fr Fabian Martin, OP, 1850-60, who oversaw the construction of two bridges in Ivana. Puente de Mahatao was built by Fr Cresencio Polo, OP during his term as parish priest, 1867-87. The bridge led directly to the Mahatao church. Puentecito de Mahatao, a small bridge along the Mahatao-Uyugan road, is unusual for its triangular rather than rounded arch. Puente de Yugan in Uyugan, consisting of three arches broken by stout piers, lies hidden under a slab of concrete decking added in the 20th century. It was built by Fr Fabian Martin during his term as missionary of Ivana. The mission of San Antonio de Yugan was renamed Uyugan between 1844 and 1878 (Noche 2011, 129-38).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>South of Manila</strong>. Puente de Zapote, Las Pi&ntilde;as is noted for being a scene of battles between the Katipuneros and the Spanish troops in 1897, and between the Katipuneros and the Americans in 1899. In Imus, Cavite is Puente de Isabel II, was built by Fray Matias in 1875. Its central pier is marked by a cross. Puente de Mabacao, along the Maragondon-Magallanes road was built in 1876, presumably by Eduardo Lopez Navarro. There are more bridges reported in Cavite but their provenance has yet to be determined (Noche 2011, 65-9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rapid economic growth of Batangas, brought about by a boom in coffee, its newest cash crop, and the steady growth of coconut plantations, made it imperative that the road system of Batangas be improved. To make this happen, the government created a distinct engineering district under Antonio de la Camara, who served as director of engineering from 1877 to 1888. While a road system, with bridges over rivers and chasms, had been laid out, the road was not paved. Americans improved on Batangas&rsquo;s road system. In Batangas are Puente de Cay Utak and Puente de Kawa-Kawa at San Jose de Malaquing Tubig. Located along the old San Jose-Lipa road, both may be the work of Fr Ramon Sanchez, OSA, who restored the church and built its belfry in 1856. Puente de Pansipit along the Taal-Lemery road was built in the late 19th century probably by Navarro or Batangas district engineer de la Camara. Puentecito de Caysasay, ca 1850, in Taal is attributed to Fr Celestino Mayordomo, OSA. Taal has many other bridges whose dates of construction and designers are uncertain: Puente de Calle Laurel and Puente de M.H. del Pilar. Puente de Bauan on the Bauan-Batangas National Road has been renovated. Only its eastern and western flanks have the original masonry work (Noche 2011, 70-9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Laguna was the site of many friar estates owned by the Dominicans and Jesuits. Some of the infrastructure in this area were the result of their effort. Equally active in construction were the Franciscans. Although they did not own any estates as their own rule of life did not allow it, the Franciscans were avid bridge builders. Fr Victorino de Moral de Calatrava, OFM built Puente de Capricho in Majayjay in 1849-52. The bridge crossed Rio de Olla and linked the church with the town&rsquo;s outskirts. Fr Victorino was highly unpopular for his exaction of labor for his building projects. Responding to complaints about him, Fr Victorino was assigned to Lucban, leaving the bridge of whim unfinished. Also crossing the Rio de Olla is Puente de Olla, inaugurated on 5 Dec 1874 (Noche 2011, 80-6). This bridge was destroyed by Typhoon Santi (international name: Mirinae) in 2003, and subsequently replaced by a concrete one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like Laguna, neighboring Quezon, has a collection of stone bridges built at the initiative of the Franciscan friars. Puente de Alitao linked Sariaya and Tayabas, the capital of the province, with the same name. An earlier wooden bridge built in 1798 was replaced by stone in 1823 during the tenure of Gov Juan Lopez. Three bridges, all in Tayabas, were essential in making this capital accessible: Puente de Don Francisco de Asis, 1854; Puente de Malagonlong, 1841-50, initiated by Fr Antonio Matheus, OFM; Puente de Mate and Puente de Lakawan. Puente de Capricho a.k.a. Puente de Arco, in Lucban, was damaged during World War II and is no longer used (Noche 2011, 87-98).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bicol&rsquo;s improved infrastructure came about as a means to protect the peninsula from slave raiders. Better roads, bridges, and a string of watchtowers made for rapid deployment of troops to respond to raids. Likewise, improved roads allowed coastal villagers to seek refuge in high ground. Bicol&rsquo;s infrastructure was greatly improved with the appointment of Jose Ma. Pe&ntilde;aranda as governor on 14 May 1834. Under his term, a rapid improvement of Bicol&rsquo;s defensive facilities was initiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The builders of the bridges of Albay are uncertain. Puente de Busay, built along Camalig-Daraga road may be the work of Ricardo Ayuso who was appointed as district engineer of Nueva Caceres, or of the Franciscan friars. Puente de Camalig may be the work of Fr Miguel Antonio de Barcela, OFM who was parish priest for two long periods, 1846-64, and 1875-70. Puente de Basud Segundo, Polangui may be the work of Fr. Jose Arnau, OFM who was parish priest from 1839 to 1848 or Fr Isidro Pons, OFM, parish priest from 1859-64. Puente de Travesia, Guinobatan may be the work of Fr Zeferino de Quintanar, parish priest from 1851 to 1863. Puente de Paulog, Lig-ao may have been built at the same time as Puente de Busay and Puente de San Jose. Like most Bicol bridges, information on year of construction and builder of Puente de Malinao and Puente San Jose, Bagacay are uncertrain (Noche 2011: 99-108).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Islands South of Luzon</strong>. Marinduque was a mission of the Franciscans, but in 1615, it was transferred to the Jesuits. Puente de Boac in Barangay Murallon is a single arched masonry bridge. Year of construction and builder are uncertain. Since the 1930s, its road deck and supporting parapets have been remodeled, obscuring its Hispanic roots (Noche 2011, 147).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Romblon in the Sibuyan Sea belonged to a cluster of islands evangelized by the Recollects beginning 1635. These islands included Banton and Tablas. The Recollects were responsible for much of the Spanish era construction, building churches, conventos, fortifications, roads and bridges. In 1853. Romblon became a&nbsp;<em>comandancia politico-militar</em>. Three bridges cluster near each other in small areas in the poblacion of the municipality of Romblon, Romblon. Puente de Belen is named for the statue of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Belen found near the bridge. The bridge leads to the parish church of San Jose. Puente de Romblon spans the same dry riverbed as Puente de Belen and like it has seats along its side. Puente de Rio Casalogan spans the Casalogan river. The year and builder of these bridges is uncertain. It could have been built by the Recollect Fathers like Fr Pedro de San Agustin, 1644-1726, who built the church at Romblon. Noche (2011, 140) suggests that these bridges may have been built under Don Eduardo Asuero y Soto, the province&rsquo;s Commandant P. M. el Teniente de Infanteria, who built the town&rsquo;s water system in 1864. The bridges may have been built at this time (Noche 2011, 139-46).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Visayas.</strong> Panay was evangelized by the Augustinians. Puente de Boni en route to Miag-ao was built in 1854 during the term of Miguel Navales as&nbsp;<em>gobernadorcillo&nbsp;</em>(mayor). The bridge is named after Boni Neular who served as <strong>maestro de obras</strong> (master builder). No longer functional, the bridge is a decorative element in a park. The bridge is slightly curved, the result of an earthquake in 1948. There are three bridges in Alimodian, the most significant of which is Puente de Eloisa, probably built during the incumbency of Fr Florencio Martin who built the church of Santo Tomas de Villanueva de Alimodian (Noche 2011, 163-67).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cebu was also evangelized by the Augustinians. Puente de Salog in Samboan may have been built at the same time as Jacob&rsquo;s ladder, a stairway of stone that leads from the road to the crest of a hill where Samboan church stands. The bridge located a few meters from the bottom of the ladder may be the work of the secular priest Toribio Gerzon, parish priest from 1847 to 1897. Other bridges in Cebu are the Parian in Cebu City, Puente de Monta&ntilde;esa in Malabuyoc, and an unnamed bridge in Alegria demolished to give way to the expansion of the Cebu Circumferential road (Noche 2011, 159-62). There are bridges, too, in Cauayan and Dalaguete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leyte and Southern Leyte were Jesuit missions founded in 1595 but turned over to Augustinians in 1768 and in the 19th century to the Franciscans. Puente de la Purisima in Palo spans the Rio Bangon. It is a 19th-century bridge. Puente de la Reina in Ormoc City is no longer functioning as a bridge but as a decorative element in a park behind the city hall. Construction of the bridge began on 30 Jun 1864 and was completed in 1865 during the incumbency of Gen Francisco de Herrera, district governor of Leyte. Puente de Combado in Maasin crosses the Putat Creek. It was built in the late 18th century (Noche 2011, 151-58).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bohol was evangelized by the Jesuits who arrived in 1596. The area was turned over to the Recollects in 1768. Most of the bridges in Bohol are in the south. Dimiao has five Spanish colonial bridges, but the more outstanding ones were Puente de Calle Mabini and Puente de Tonga Can-andan. Puente de Calle Mabini in Dimiao is located inland. Its history is uncertain. Puente de Tonga Can-andan along the Dimiao-Valencia Road may have been the work of Fr Enrique de Santo Tomas de Villanueva, OAR, who was the parish priest in 1795-1805, 1806-12, and 1815-17, or Fr Manuel Carasuan de San Pascual, OAR, the parish priest in 1844-45.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puente de Riego in Loboc is one of six bridges built during the incumbency of Fr Aquilino Bon in 1856. Fr Bon was known for his architectural projects. The new facade of Loboc church and its free-standing bell tower are the works of Bon. The five other bridges of Loboc are: Puente de Guadalupe, Puente de Garita, Puente de San Pedro, Puente de Alagras, and Puente de La Loma. Puente de Lam-ao in Lila was built in the 19th century. Other Bohol bridges are Puente de Dauis; Puente de Balbalan, Puente de Calle Mabini, Puente de Dimiao, and Puente de Taongon, all in Dimiao; and Puente de Tiguis, Puente de Lumanoy, and Puente de Lum-ap, all in Lila. A bridge of earthwork, technically called a causeway, was built during the 19th century in Bohol to link the towns of Tagbilaran and Dauis. Rammed earth held by stone riprap at its approaches crossed the Dauis channel. The middle span was made of wood and elevated so that boats could still travel through the channel (Noche 2011, 167-71).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>American Colonial Era</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Spanish built many bridges in the 19th century, bridge building during the American period took on a faster pace as the colonial government sought to improve transportation and communication. Deteriorating bridges were repaired or replaced by new ones. Work begun during the Spanish era was improved and continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>American-built bridges were of three types. The most durable, the <strong>steel bridge</strong>, consisted of girders or trusses resting on concrete piers sunk into the riverbed. This was the <strong>truss bridge</strong>. The roadway could be made of sturdy lumber, like molave, or paved with asphalt. A rung below the steel bridge was the wooden bridge that spanned creeks and rivulets. This bridge followed the structural design of the girder bridge or consisted of a triangular arch, with the bases embedded in the earth and the apex supporting the span. The structure supported the roadway, which was flanked by railings on either side. A third type of bridge, similar to the <strong>pontoon bridge</strong>, rested on the surface of the water and was used while a permanent bridge was being repaired or built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many American-built bridges are still used today. The Ayala Bridge over the Pasig is one example. In 1906, this steel truss bridge replaced the old Puente de la Convalesencia. The bridge linked the north and south banks of the Pasig with a short spur connecting to the Isla. During the American regime, other hispanic bridges built over the Pasig were also replaced by new ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jones Bridge replaced Puente de Espa&ntilde;a damaged by a typhoon in 1914. Construction on the pre-World War II bridge began in 1916 and was completed in 1921. Designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, it was built west of the Puente de Espa&ntilde;a. It was considered the most beautiful bridge of its time&mdash;allegorical statues decorated its approach and the sides of its piers, complementing its neoclassical design. The concrete statues have been attributed to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3655\">Ramon Martinez</a>; however, this attribution has been placed in doubt and the name of German sculptor, Otto Fisher-Credo, has been cited. Fisher-Credo, 1890-1959, who collaborated with Arellano on the sculptures and decorative elements of the Legislative building, was born in Berlin and died in Vancouver. He studied at the academies of art in Berlin, 1908-15, and in Paris, 1919-21. He lived in the Philippines, Mexico, Cuba, the United States, and settled in Canada. He befriended Mexican muralist Diego Rivera in Mexico. In 1926, he had his first solo show in Manila and then lived in Manila for six years. Photographs of Fisher-Credo&rsquo;s studio show the <strong><em>Madre Filipina</em></strong>, one of four statues on the bridge in his studio. The dolphins flanking the bridge piers are by Fisher-Credo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bridge cost one million dollars to build and was criticized for being so luxurious. Destroyed during World War II, it was replaced by a simpler bridge after. Three of the four statues on the bridge survived bombardment in 1945. <strong><em>Madre Filipina</em></strong> was moved to Rizal Park and the two other statues to the front of the Court of Appeals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quiapo Bridge in the art deco style was built to replace Puente Colgante. The bridge was allowed to function until Quiapo Bridge was completed and then Colgante was taken down. The Spanish era Santa Cruz Bridge was completed during the American era. Santa Cruz was damaged during World War II and replaced by a reinforced structure after the war. Quiapo Bridge on which the Americans mounted large cannons to shell the southern side of Manila, especially Intramuros where Japanese troops had retreated and taken refuge, was generally spared from damage. Quiapo Bridge would afterwards be renamed Quezon Bridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Bonifacio Drive was built as an extension of Dewey Blvd, a bridge was built to connect the road with the North Harbor on the northern side of the Pasig. It was named Del Pan, and much later renamed Roxas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many American-built bridges still stand all over the Philippines. Built from 1901 to 1905, Kennon Road linked Rosario, La Union with Baguio, the summer capital. To bridge gaps between chasms, trestle bridges were built, later to be replaced by steel truss bridges. One of the longest bridges is found in Carmen, Pangasinan. Its central section was a truss bridge which was unfortunately damaged by the earthquake of 1990. Many bridges of the American Era were truss bridges, found all over Luzon and as far south as Cagayan de Oro. Made of standardized girders, they were composed of trusses, a structure of connected elements shaped as a triangle. The trusses were imported from the United States and the units were sent where needed. It was easy to construct a truss bridge&mdash;all that was needed was to bolt and weld the units together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Period</strong> of the Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of Philippine infrastructure was destroyed during World War II. During the 1940s and 1950s, rehabilitation was the guiding principle. With the use of reinforced concrete which was introduced in the pre-World War II era, bridges built after the war took on simpler lines. Massive piers built into the riverbed supported reinforced-concrete girders. The roadways were paved with concrete or asphalt and were flanked by pedestrian walkways with concrete railings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reinforced concrete bridges were common during the post-World War II period and as reinforced concrete improved and better engineering techniques developed, the construction of lighter, longer, and stronger bridge spans made it possible to connect not only waterways but also low areas prone to flooding and the intersections of roads. All this gave rise to superhighways and elevated roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 1960s to the 1980s, the government prided itself in the improvement of infrastructure in the country. Cemented highways were built to link the capital, Manila, with provinces north and south. At intersections, where heavy traffic was expected to converge, underpasses and overpasses were built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was during Ferdinand Marcos&rsquo;s first term, 1965-69, that the development and construction of infrastructure assumed a rapid pace. His success at public works was one reason why he was voted to a second term. Marcos prided himself for having had built more roads and bridges than all the previous administrations. The construction of the North Diversion road, now North Luzon Expressway or NLEX, began during Marcos&rsquo;s first term. NLEX introduced a number of innovations in the bridges that had to be built over the toll way to allow for through traffic from Manila to the north. Ramps or interchanges which were variations of bridges had to be constructed. The connection between NLEX and EDSA at Balintawak was a cloverleaf, the first such structure in the Philippines. Other interchange types were diamond, folded diamond with roundabout, trumpet, trumpet with roundabout, half Y, and parcio or partial cloverleaf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The North Expressway has an elevated portion, the Candaba Viaduct, which stretches for about 40 km above flood-prone areas. Although called a viaduct, structurally it is a long bridge resting on piers sunk into the flat plains of Pampanga. Also constructed was the Patapat Viaduct linking Pagudpud, Ilocos Norte and the Cagayan Valley. Elevated 31 m above the sea and running along the northernmost coast of Luzon, it is 1.3 km long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Marcos&rsquo;s second term, two bridge projects stood out: the San Juanico and the Cebu-Mactan bridge. Construction began on the San Juanico in 1969 and finished in 1973 during the era of martial law. This arched shaped truss bridge was 2,200 m or 2.2 km, making it the longest bridge in the Philippines. The bridge linked Santa Rita on Samar Island and Tacloban on Leyte. The bridge was part of the Pan-Philippine Highway that ran through the eastern side of Luzon. The bridge had a graceful S-curve when exiting San Juanico Island to move north toward Samar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The channel separating Mandaue, Cebu, and Mactan Island was bridged to expedite traffic between these two islands. The project was integral to the construction of an international airport at Mactan, as the old Cebu airport at Lahug was dangerous for aircrafts because of its proximity to the mountains and its inadequacy for handling larger airplanes that had international routes. Construction on the bridge began in 1970 and was completed in 1972. The box truss type bridge was 846 m long and 9 m wide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building bridges continued after the Marcos era as government improved infrastructure. Lahar from the 1991 eruption of Mt Pinatubo covered the Central Plains, especially Pampanga, and made MacArthur Highway impassable. To address this problem, the section of MacArthur that had been covered was raised and a suspension bridge was built between Mabalacat, Pampanga and Capas, Tarlac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cebu, a second bridge was opened in Aug 1999 to connect Mandaue with Lapu-Lapu City. Named after Supreme Court Justice, Marcelo Fernan, of Cebu, it is a cable-stayed bridge 1,237 m long. The central span is 185 m. In this bridge type, the central section is a suspension bridge anchored to a central tower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bridge has been used further in constructing elevated highways or skyways, for building approaches to the highways, and as a system to channel traffic. Bridges also link tall buildings and may be elevated pedestrian passages from one building to the next in the business district of a city.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.
