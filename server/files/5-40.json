Composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3860\">Ogie Alcasid</a> and Aaron Paul del Rosario. The song is included in the album <b><i>Ogie Alcasid On Air </i></b>released in 1994 by PolyEast Records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Bakit Ngayon Ka Lang&rdquo; expresses the singer&rsquo;s distress about meeting the love of his life too late, after he has committed to someone else. The chorus reads:</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bakit ngayon ka lang dumating sa buhay ko</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pilit binubuksan ang sarado ko nang puso</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ikaw ba ay nararapat sa akin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At siya ba&rsquo;y dapat ko nang limutin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Why have you come to my life only now</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Compelling my already committed heart to open</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Are you the right one for me</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">And should I forget her)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the key of G major, this is a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">pop</a> song in the common verse-refrain-chorus form. The two verses span eight bars, each made up of &ldquo;square&rdquo; (or symmetrical) phrases. These contrast with the refrain, in which the eight bars are extended to two more and the chorus, which accelerates after the eight bars. The pattern of regularly phrased verses followed by the extended chorus section articulates the moving message of the lyrics that goes hand in hand with the transformation of Alcasid&rsquo;s voice from tenderness in the verses to an impetuous rendering of the questioning in the chorus, especially in its repeats with notes in high register. The strings-laden accompaniment supports this transformation, creating a mood of endearment that &ldquo;embraces&rdquo; Alcasid&rsquo;s voice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2001, the band Freestyle, with its lead vocalist Top Suzara, sang the song in concert with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3984\">Pops Fernandez</a>, interpreting it as a male-female duet. While Alcasid&rsquo;s version presents a one-sided perspective, the duet of Suzara and Fernandez expands the song&rsquo;s narrative with both parties now seemingly engaged in a conversation about their longing for each other and the regret that comes with the realization that they can never be together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Suzara and Fernandez&rsquo;s live performance was recorded and included in the album <b><i>Love Concert: The Album Vol. 1</i></b>, 2002, a collection of love songs by Freestyle, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\">Zsa Zsa Padilla</a>, and Lani Misalucha, released by VIVA Records. &ldquo;Bakit Ngayon Ka Lang&rdquo; also became one of Freestyle&rsquo;s most popular songs. Suzara with fellow vocalist Jinky Vidal performed it several times and most recently in their 2016 concert, years after their disbandment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alcasid&rsquo;s version became the theme song for the movie <b><i>Jeannie, Bakit Ngayon Ka Lang</i></b>, 2002, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4583\">Robin Padilla</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4673\">Judy Ann Santos</a>. In 2005, Freestyle recorded the song with Pops Fernandez for their album <b><i>Greatest Hits</i></b>. <b><i>Pilipinas Got Talent </i></b>Season 2 champion Marcelito Pomoy performed the song for his album <b><i>Duet Yourself</i></b>, 2011. His unique vocal range allowed him to sing both male and female parts, making it seem as if two people are singing the duet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alcasid has also included this song in several of his albums: <b><i>Ogie 10th All the Best</i></b>, 1998; <b><i>OA sa Hits Live </i></b>(Ogie Alcasid&rsquo;s Hits Live), 2002; <b><i>All the Classics</i></b>, 2007; <b><i>Ogie Alcasid Greatest Hits Vol.</i></b> <b><i>2</i></b>, 2010; and a vinyl release of <b><i>All the Classics</i></b>, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Bakit Ngayon Ka Lang&rdquo; remains to be one of Alcasid&rsquo;s most endearing and popular compositions.

The pattern of regularly phrased verses followed by the extended chorus section articulates the moving message of the lyrics that goes hand in hand with the transformation of Alcasid&#x2019;s voice from tenderness in the verses to an impetuous rendering of the questioning in the chorus, especially in its repeats with notes in high register.

Then, the theme is augmented (i.e., note values are lengthened). Meanwhile, the pianist improvises in a lazy blues style. This creates the effect of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> improvisation becoming the subject, while the theme serves as the background behind it. A few moments later, the meter suddenly changes to cut-time tempo (i.e., 2/2). This is the loud swinging shout chorus or tutti. The baritone sax continues the syncopation alone leading to the &ldquo;vamp.&rdquo; The final cadence of the theme, starting with the tutti in measure 55, is played ferociously as before. Then the five saxophones play swinging rhythms. Thereafter, the brasses join the saxophones rhythmically.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Measures 129 to 134 serve as a transition, with the drummer playing in unison with the band and leading back to the main theme. Later, the main theme is played by the trombones with syncopated rhythms of the brass and saxophone sections, giving the drummer a chance to employ his incisive &ldquo;combination kicks&rdquo; to relentlessly push the big band. This effect lasts for a brief moment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In measure 147, the key changes from E-flat major to F major. The saxophone section is again featured with cluttered notes in a syncopated pattern. Then comes a brief modulation to the key of A-flat major. In these measures, the rhythm section is in unison with the band in order to enhance the excitement. Measure 155, which is now in the key of A-flat, culminates the piece by restating the theme, this time in a clearer way. Towards the end, the piece is in blues style (4/4 time). The note A-flat is intoned by the lead trumpet in order to stress the final key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>Balik-bayan</strong></i></b> is inspired by the few big bands in the country and is significant because it enriches original Philippine music literature for big band.

As the number of audience-performers receiving the instruments gradually increases, the density of the sound forest accumulates as well. Succeeding versions of <b><i><strong>Banwa</strong></i></b> also involved other instruments available in the locality.

A haunting cloud of sustained voices opens the piece. Performers dance in a circle, while assorted vocal utterances, slides, gasps, shouts, grunts, tremors, echoes, and syllabic enunciations are heard. There are momentary bouts of silence as the performers continue their circular dance. The vocalizations take on a ritualistic air that is punctuated at the end by the savage throb of a drum. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

There are momentary bouts of silence as the performers continue their circular dance.

In Paredes&rsquo;s composition, written after the birth of his first child, a male parent, speaks to his child who responds in turn.

The three-act sarsuwela by Servando de los Angeles contained 17 songs, including &ldquo;Bituing Marikit&rdquo; which was drawn from the third act. De los Angeles&rsquo;s lyrics for this song were inspired by and dedicated to the lady he married.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abelardo, a romanticist, produced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>kundiman</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><b>balitaw</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/770\"><b>balse</b></a>, and <b>danza</b><i> </i>now considered immortal Filipino classics for their intense emotion and haunting beauty. Through his music, he elevated the popular folk forms to the level of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/768\">art song</a>, and used lyrics often infused with a genuine sense of nationalism. In the sweeping rhythm of the danza, &ldquo;Bituing Marikit&rdquo; portrays a passionate lover who likens the beloved to an unreachable star shining in the &ldquo;night of life.&rdquo; The lover begs to be thrown a ray of light, or be allowed to &ldquo;drink&rdquo; from the &ldquo;pure stream&rdquo; of love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this song, words and music are perfectly matched, flowing in an easy rhythm.

Music and lyrics, anonymous.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Comintang de la Conquista&rdquo;<b> </b>is the title of a musical transcription inserted into the atlas of the travelogue <b><i>Les Philippines</i></b>, 1846, by the French adventurer Jean Baptiste Mallat. The transcription consists of three parts&mdash;voice, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a>, respectively&mdash;and is attributed to Henry Cohen, a 19th century French numismatist, bibliographer, and composer. Three stanzas of poorly transcribed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> text, describing a suitor bemoaning his unrequited love, are also included in the insert. The first stanza goes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sinor a un Caya sa sandaigdigan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang may dusa nitong aguing cahirapan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Di mo na nilingot pina lungai lungai</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pagsinta sa iyong valang calilohan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Who in the world</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Experiences the suffering and difficulties I have gone</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">You do not turn to look at me and avoid my gaze</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even as I offer my faithful love for you. )</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cohen transcription was later reprinted in toto in John Bowring&rsquo;s travelogue, <b><i>A Visit to the Philippines</i></b>, 1859. The publisher of Mallat&rsquo;s book or perhaps Cohen himself incorrectly represented <b>comintang</b> by conflating the guitar and piano accompaniments into a music system so that dissonance from the simultaneous sounding of pitches A and B-flat occurs (see Fig. 1 below). The rhythm of the guitar is, however, nearer the correct representation, but the piano is not because the latter is in common classical style harmonic progression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">What might have been a publication error became a subject of later commentaries. The Cohen transcription finds itself the subject of comments made by Filipinist scholar Epifanio de los Santos (1871-1928) in Wenceslao Retana&rsquo;s edition of Tomas Morga&rsquo;s <b><i>Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas</i></b><i> </i>(Events in the Philippine Islands)<i> </i>[Madrid, 1909]. De los Santos, who was also considered one of the finest guitarists in Manila at the time, notes that a portion of the score (measures 24-28) does not conform to his experience of <b>comintang</b> performance. As noted above, de los Santos referred to the dissonant section caused by the piano part as &ldquo;son de factura moderna&rdquo; (they are a modern creation).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musical score of comintang in Mallat&rsquo;s book is valuable because it is the earliest extant transcription of the traditional comintang. Walls y Merino referred to it in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1039\"><strong>La Musica Popular de Filipinas</strong></a> </i></b>(Popular Music in the Philippines), 1892, as the <b>canto nacional</b><i> </i>(national song) of the Tagalog, a comment reflecting its popularity at the time. Except for the piano part and the measures cited by de los Santos, &ldquo;Comintang de la Conquista&rdquo; displays the common features of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\"><b>awit</b></a> song-and-dance form, also associated with many Tagalog groups, namely: 1) the presence of two distinct and loosely connected lines&mdash;vocal and instrumental; 2) the use of the <i>plosa</i> verse form (dodecasyllabic, monorhyming quatrains); and 3) the presence of a loose, flexible ostinato-like instrumental line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cohen transcription and three other extant transcriptions of 19th century comintang (one by Manuel Walls y Merino in 1892 and two by Epifanio de los Santos in 1895), plus late 20th century transcriptions of an <b>awit</b> from Batangas province in the Southern Tagalog region by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4146\">Rivera Mirano</a>, 1997, allow us to conclude that the comintang or <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><b>kumintang</b></a>, as it is rendered in modern orthography, is a type of awit.

The rhythm of the guitar is, however, nearer the correct representation, but the piano is not because the latter is in common classical style harmonic progression."

De los Santos, who was also considered one of the finest guitarists in Manila at the time, notes that a portion of the score (measures 24-28) does not conform to his experience of <b>comintang</b> performance. As noted above, de los Santos referred to the dissonant section caused by the piano part as &#x201C;son de factura moderna&#x201D; (they are a modern creation)."

Except for the piano part and the measures cited by de los Santos, &#x201C;Comintang de la Conquista&#x201D; displays the common features of the <a href=\"/9/73/1555\"><b>awit</b></a> song-and-dance form, also associated with many Tagalog groups, namely: 1) the presence of two distinct and loosely connected lines&#x2014;vocal and instrumental; 2) the use of the <i>plosa</i> verse form (dodecasyllabic, monorhyming quatrains); and 3) the presence of a loose, flexible ostinato-like instrumental line."

Kasilag chose to call the work a divertissement<i> </i>despite its form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first movement uses the rhythm of the bamboo poles in the Muslim dance, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><i>singkil</i></a>, in the style of a ground-bass. It is also called the &ldquo;Allegro in white,&rdquo; as it uses only the white keys of the piano. The second movement is slower and cast in a simple variation form; the theme is based on a nine-measure Muslim chant called <i>dende-o-dende</i>.

By 1921, at age 28, Abelardo created a piece where the characteristics of the nocturne as established by Field can be identified, i.e., a song-like melody (right hand) with arpeggiated chordal accompaniment (left hand), and return of the first section after a contrasting section (ABA). From hereon, Abelardo departed from this structural convention. In the return of the first section (A), the melody is restated but within a brief contrapuntal texture. The B section is also restated but in another surprising tonality of D-flat major (B-flat major tonality was used in the first statement), again featuring the creative expansions of the B section melody with right hand octaves and a chromaticism of the left hand accompaniment that enhances the increasing dramatic intensity of the song-like melody.

A brief statement of the initial melody leads to an <i>ad libitum</i> chromatic cadenza with both hands, a performance practice in concert piano pieces of the Romantic period.

Included in the album <b><i>Cutterpillow </i></b>released by BMG Records (Pilipinas) under its Musiko Label. Produced by Robin Rivera and Romel Sanchez.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the song, a once-upon-a-time lover recalls the past with his beloved, whose beauty is likened to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4587\">Paraluman</a>, a Filipino movie icon from the 1950s. The use of &ldquo;paraluman&rdquo;&mdash;an archaic Tagalog word which means muse&mdash;signals the distance of the vision of the past filled with desire and enchantment. The beauty&rsquo;s dancing skills&mdash;especially to the music of &ldquo;El Bimbo,&rdquo; a 1970s disco hit&mdash;are so sensuous to the former lover, titillating (<i>nakakaindak, nakakaaliw</i>) him and eliciting gooseflesh (<i>nakakatindig balahibo</i>) on his body. In the first part of the song, erotic images abound, like the clasped lovers&rsquo; arms, body stiffening as response to dance music, lovers&rsquo; caresses, and hands sliding down the smooth flesh of the beauty&rsquo;s arm.

The beauty&#x2019;s dancing skills&#x2014;especially to the music of &#x201C;El Bimbo,&#x201D; a 1970s disco hit&#x2014;are so sensuous to the former lover, titillating (<i>nakakaindak, nakakaaliw</i>) him and eliciting gooseflesh (<i>nakakatindig balahibo</i>) on his body. In the first part of the song, erotic images abound, like the clasped lovers&#x2019; arms, body stiffening as response to dance music, lovers&#x2019; caresses, and hands sliding down the smooth flesh of the beauty&#x2019;s arm.

A favorite among the Bulacan revolutionaries of 1896, its printed score was found among the papers of Juan Molina, leader of Orquesta Molina. The score bore an inscription:<i> Musica del legitimo kundiman procedente del campo insurrecto</i> (Music of the authentic kundiman coming from the insurgents&rsquo; camp).</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cast in the slow triple time of the traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>kundiman</b></a>,<b> </b>the song has two parts. While the melody of the song has been praised for its haunting but mellifluous quality, its prosody has been criticized as flawed, because the lyrics do not seem to conform to the rhythm.

Music, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4197\">Josefino &ldquo;Chino&rdquo; Toledo</a>.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Commissioned for the annual Hong Kong <b><i>Musicarama</i></b>, the piece represents a culmination of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestral</a> composition in the 20th century. Toledo&rsquo;s unmistakable eruptive writing style is amplified by the use of indigenous music as central material built into a reconfigured Western structure and marked by a decisive departure from orchestral convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toledo was motivated to compose the piece after chancing upon a recording of a chant from the Tagabawa of Mindanao. From this music, he adopted a brief passage to serve as the core idea of the work, not in the conventional sense of a melodic theme, but as a structural foundation that provides coherence to the entire piece, highlighting the composer&rsquo;s penchant for form-based writing. Toledo, moreover, deconstructed the chant to extract idiosyncratic components such as ornamentation, articulation, and phrasing along with vocal interjections. Figure 1 shows an abstraction of the Tagabawa passage exhibiting a falling contour.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tagabawa passage above constitutes the recurring section of the piece, which provides a contrast to a transforming section that it alternates with, thus resembling the <b>ritornello </b>form [ABACADA&hellip;]. Toledo assigns the recurring section to the woodwinds, instead of full orchestra as in the conventional Baroque <b>concerto grosso</b> which utilizes the ritornello form, and relegates the transforming section to the entire orchestra. Rather than opening the piece with the recurring section, Toledo begins with the transforming section, a concept he has applied before as a student composer, in a piece titled <b><i>Barasyon, Tema, Barasyon at Tema Uli </i></b>(Variation, Theme, Variations and Theme Again, 1980) which rearranges the theme and variation sequence. Figure 2 below summarizes this structure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from instrumentation, the contrast between the transforming and recurring sections plays out in the texture and the use of time.

From this music, he adopted a brief passage to serve as the core idea of the work, not in the conventional sense of a melodic theme, but as a structural foundation that provides coherence to the entire piece, highlighting the composer&#x2019;s penchant for form-based writing. Toledo, moreover, deconstructed the chant to extract idiosyncratic components such as ornamentation, articulation, and phrasing along with vocal interjections. Figure 1 shows an abstraction of the Tagabawa passage exhibiting a falling contour."

Toledo assigns the recurring section to the woodwinds, instead of full orchestra as in the conventional Baroque <b>concerto grosso</b> which utilizes the ritornello form, and relegates the transforming section to the entire orchestra. Rather than opening the piece with the recurring section, Toledo begins with the transforming section, a concept he has applied before as a student composer, in a piece titled <b><i>Barasyon, Tema, Barasyon at Tema Uli </i></b>(Variation, Theme, Variations and Theme Again, 1980) which rearranges the theme and variation sequence.

Music, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3981\">Julian Felipe</a>; lyrics, Jose Isaac Velasquez Palma.

Filipino translation by the Department of Education, 1956. Commissioned by Emilio Aguinaldo. First performed by Banda San Francisco de Malabon (now General Trias) in Kawit, Cavite, on the occasion of the declaration of Philippine independence on 12 Jun 1898.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The manuscript of the composition bore the heading &ldquo;Marcha Filipina Nacional&rdquo; (Philippine National March) although it was also known as the &ldquo;Marcha Filipino Magdalo&rdquo; (Philippine Magdalo March), Magdalo being Aguinaldo&rsquo;s nom-de-guerre. Gen Emilio Aguinaldo and some leaders of the 1896 Revolution liked Felipe&rsquo;s work, and after a brief discussion, suggested that it be officially adopted as the Philippine national anthem. Some scholars aver that the music of the anthem shows the influence of the Spanish and French national anthems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A year after the melody was composed, Palma wrote a poem, &ldquo;Filipinas, Letra Para La Marcha Nacional&rdquo; (Philippines, Lyrics for the National March), which was published on 3 Sep 1899 in <b><i>La <strong>Independencia</strong></i></b>,<i> </i>the official organ of the Philippine revolution edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\">Antonio Luna</a>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poem</a> became the lyrics of the national anthem. The &ldquo;Himno&rdquo; was reportedly first sung by the staff of the newspaper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1906, the wife of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3924\">Fernando Canon</a>, Teresa Battle, commissioned a composer to use the melody of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><b>marcha</b></a> in nine-sectioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> variations in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">popular music</a> style and published this in Madrid in a piece titled &ldquo;A Rizal: Lirismo Patriotico&rdquo; (To Rizal: Patriotic Lyricism). In 1928, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\">Alexander Lippay</a>, then director of the University of the Philippines Conservatory of Music, composed a complicated symphonic work titled <b><i>Thirteen Variations on the Philippine National Hymn,</i></b> based on the melody of the march.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1943, then president Jose P. Laurel ordered the Institute of National Language to translate the original Spanish text into Filipino and English. The first stanza of the original Spanish text, the Filipino translation (then titled &ldquo;Diwang Bayan&rdquo; or National Ideal), and the English translation, are as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">SPANISH</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tierra adorada</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hija del sol de Oriente</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Su fuego ardiente</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">En ti latiendo esta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">FILIPINO</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lupang mapalad na mutya ng Silangan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bayang kasuyo ng sangkalikasan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Buhay at yaman ng Kapilipinuhan</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kuha&rsquo;t bawi na sa banyagang kamay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ENGLISH</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Land of the morning</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Child of the sun returning</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With fervor burning</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thee do our souls adore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1956, the Department of Education formed a committee of musicians, writers, and technical staff of various government departments which sat down to create a more spontaneous and apt Filipino translation of the anthem. The result was &ldquo;Lupang Hinirang.&rdquo; Under Presidential Proclamation No 60 that took effect on 19 Dec 1963, this Filipino version of the Palma text became the official anthem of the Philippines that is sung to the present. It runs:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Lupang Hinirang</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bayang magiliw</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt;

Padilla de Leon captures the jaunty canter of the horse-drawn carriage in &ldquo;Carromata&rdquo; and the loud, harsh sound of the klaxon or motor horn in &ldquo;Automobile.&rdquo; To write &ldquo;Calle Ongpin,&rdquo; the composer took a leisurely walk through Ongpin to get the right atmosphere, which he then vividly depicted in a characteristically Chinese pentatonic scale.

In &#x201C;Musikong Bumbong,&#x201D; a tribute to that fast-disappearing ensemble of bamboo instruments that plays from house to house, the bamboo bass thumps a basso ostinato<i> </i>that is grotesque and at times comical. Padilla de Leon captures the jaunty canter of the horse-drawn carriage in &#x201C;Carromata&#x201D; and the loud, harsh sound of the klaxon or motor horn in &#x201C;Automobile.&#x201D; To write &#x201C;Calle Ongpin,&#x201D; the composer took a leisurely walk through Ongpin to get the right atmosphere, which he then vividly depicted in a characteristically Chinese pentatonic scale. He ends the work with a raucous quarrel between a dog and cat in the quiet of night. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by<strong> </strong><a href=\"/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C.

It is based on ancient <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> musical literary forms such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\"><b>auit</b></a>; the <b>comintang</b><i>,</i> an example of<i> </i>which was transcribed by Mallat in 1846<i> </i>and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>cundiman</b></a>,<i> </i>samples of which were published by Retana in 1882<i> </i>and Walls y Merino in 1892. In the piece, the composer utilizes the texts of these samples as the spine that draws together the various elements and establishes the flow of the music from the beginning to the end. Clarity in the conveyance of the words is maintained through the employment of speech rhythm throughout the work&rsquo;s entirety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piece employs simple, unison textures that contrast with the extremely dynamic, highly kinetic, and virtuosic writing style that has become associated with Toledo&rsquo;s work. In reality, however, the unison is but alluded to throughout most of the piece in the form of variable tempo choices, desynchronized execution of passages, and homophonic sections. Strictly unison segments appear only at the very end of the approximately 16-minute long composition, providing a sense of resolution and finality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Akin to the &ldquo;drone plus melody&rdquo; texture prevalent in many types of music in Asia, <b><i>Mga <strong>Awit</strong> ng Paglingap</i></b> rests on dual, simultaneous components: 1) the <b>core</b> referred to by the composer as the &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; and 2) the <b>periphery</b> composed of an atmosphere of sounds termed &ldquo;ripples&rdquo; or &ldquo;rivulets.&rdquo; The core component carries the text and provides the piece a forward motion. This component appears in three forms: (1) as spoken or whispered passages; (2) as homophonic part; and (3) as heterophonic segments. Spoken or whispered passages are written with approximate tempi marked as fast or moderately fast and imprecise pitch levels marked as lowest possible voice level or normal voice level. Homophonic parts are composed of 8-voice chords moving in parallel motion and notated in plain-chant style using note heads without stems (see Fig 1).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Here, the use of <b>portamento</b> and occasional grace notes are reminiscent of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><b>pasyon</b></a><i> </i>singing. Heterophonic segments on the other hand may be seen as &ldquo;false unisons&rdquo; written as single melodic lines for entire vocal sections but not intended to be precisely synchronised, thus marked with the instruction &ldquo;not necessarily together&rdquo;<i> </i>(see Fig. 2).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The periphery component provides the environment for the core in the form of vocables (<i>ah,</i> <i>hm, loo, dum </i>or <i>deng</i>) set to long tones transcribed as whole notes. These sections gradually incorporate shorter durations notated as black note heads and applying indeterminacy in the sequence of pitches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Each of the 16 singers plays bamboo percussion (stones may be used alternatively) notated as non-pitched sounds. The percussion functions mainly as a punctuating device played in unison to mark verse-endings. Gradually, however, the composer disperses the beating of the instrument transforming its function to a coloring device.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Towards the end of the piece, the dual components (core and periphery) blend into one homophonic stream using 8-voice chords doubled in octaves&mdash;Sopranos 1-4 doubled an octave below by Tenors 1-4 and Altos 1-4 doubled an octave below by Basses 1-4.

Music,<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\">Jose Maceda</a>.<b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>Music for Five Pianos</strong></i></b> aka <b><i>M5P</i></b> alludes to the composer&rsquo;s return to his musical roots, having started his career as a concert pianist in the 1930s. In this piece, Maceda divorces the instrument from centuries of solo &ldquo;pianistic&rdquo; performance practice by reducing it to what he calls a &ldquo;sound box&rdquo; (Maceda 2000). He constructs the piece from the same tool kit used for all his works: layers of repeated motifs that form varying textures and densities of sound masses. In <b><i>M5P</i></b>, he completely obliterates melody&mdash;a process that plays a significant role in most of his works&mdash;except perhaps when melodic fragments are accidentally heard in the interplay of the layers of sound. Rhythm, as in his other compositions, is disjointed through the use of uncommon subdivisions of the beat, such as 7:4 (or 7 notes in 4 beats), 10:3, rendering the meter, although set in four quarter notes to a measure, largely imperceptible.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Maceda divides <b><i>M5P</i></b> into two main contrasting sections: the first half where the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">pianos</a> play in &ldquo;complementarity&rdquo; with each other, playing similar repeated phrases; and the second half where they &ldquo;become individual boxes.&rdquo; In the work, they play distinctive parts, which include passages mimicking techniques of classical piano repertoire. Structurally, it is built on the same framework that underlies all other Maceda pieces. The 30- to 40-minute piece is divided into 20 subsections (marked 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B all the way to 20B), each comprising 15 measures. In most of Maceda&rsquo;s compositions, these subsections delineate one minute of elapsed time. Since <b><i>M5P</i></b> is marked 30-40 MM to a quarter note, each subsection then lasts anywhere from 1.5 to 2 minutes. This internal construction gives hints to the composer&rsquo;s writing style as being largely influenced by the electroacoustic devices of<i> </i><b>musique concrete</b><i> </i>in Paris in the 1940s where sonic events are plotted on to a running timeline. This further explains the idiosyncratic notation that he employs where notes are written on the bar lines, like a node plotted on a grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first main section opens with octave arpeggios on pitch A covering the entire gamut of the keyboard and running in 16th notes. Gradually, other pitches are introduced starting with B-flat, D-flat, E as rhythmic figures transform to include divisions of 5:2, 3:2 and 7:3, until the 5 pianos play the octave arpeggios in varying rhythms and pitches. The arpeggios give way to reiterated open fifth chords in subsection 4A (ms 46) where the pianists play root-fifth-root chords in both hands in varying rhythms and registers. These chords are soon filled in with other pitches, producing tone clusters, rendering this section heavily dense and sonorous. When we get to 8A (ms 106), the tone clusters are replaced by running ascending scales marked by varying lengths and abrupt silences. Gradually, descending patterns are added to the mix, along with grace notes. The first section ends on 10A (ms 136), which is roughly the middle of the piece, with a &lsquo;recapitulation&rsquo; of 1A to 1B<i>,</i><b> </b>finishing in repeated blocks of octaves in 11B<i>.</i><b> </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second main section begins on 12A<i> </i>(ms 166) as the tail end of the first section gradually diminishes. From this point onwards, the five pianos assume characteristics distinct from each other. Piano 1 reverberates with sustained cluster chords while Piano 2 plays an ostinato of cluster chords alternating with major sixth in octaves. Piano 4 soon enters with repeated open octaves while Piano 3 provides cadenza-like passages. Piano 5 is last to enter with extended trills and brief, rapid scalar phrases in contrary motion which, before long, transform into a swiftly swirling passage. The tension builds up as the overall density and volume increases until all the five pianos return to playing similar passages of open octaves in varying durations in 17A.

In this piece, Maceda divorces the instrument from centuries of solo &#x201C;pianistic&#x201D; performance practice by reducing it to what he calls a &#x201C;sound box&#x201D; (Maceda 2000). He constructs the piece from the same tool kit used for all his works: layers of repeated motifs that form varying textures and densities of sound masses. In <b><i>M5P</i></b>, he completely obliterates melody&#x2014;a process that plays a significant role in most of his works&#x2014;except perhaps when melodic fragments are accidentally heard in the interplay of the layers of sound. Rhythm, as in his other compositions, is disjointed through the use of uncommon subdivisions of the beat, such as 7:4 (or 7 notes in 4 beats), 10:3, rendering the meter, although set in four quarter notes to a measure, largely imperceptible."

Structurally, it is built on the same framework that underlies all other Maceda pieces. The 30- to 40-minute piece is divided into 20 subsections (marked 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B all the way to 20B), each comprising 15 measures. In most of Maceda&#x2019;s compositions, these subsections delineate one minute of elapsed time. Since <b><i>M5P</i></b> is marked 30-40 MM to a quarter note, each subsection then lasts anywhere from 1.5 to 2 minutes. This internal construction gives hints to the composer&#x2019;s writing style as being largely influenced by the electroacoustic devices of<i> </i><b>musique concrete</b><i> </i>in Paris in the 1940s where sonic events are plotted on to a running timeline. This further explains the idiosyncratic notation that he employs where notes are written on the bar lines, like a node plotted on a grid."

Gradually, other pitches are introduced starting with B-flat, D-flat, E as rhythmic figures transform to include divisions of 5:2, 3:2 and 7:3, until the 5 pianos play the octave arpeggios in varying rhythms and pitches. The arpeggios give way to reiterated open fifth chords in subsection 4A (ms 46) where the pianists play root-fifth-root chords in both hands in varying rhythms and registers. These chords are soon filled in with other pitches, producing tone clusters, rendering this section heavily dense and sonorous. When we get to 8A (ms 106), the tone clusters are replaced by running ascending scales marked by varying lengths and abrupt silences. Gradually, descending patterns are added to the mix, along with grace notes. The first section ends on 10A (ms 136), which is roughly the middle of the piece, with a &#x2018;recapitulation&#x2019; of 1A to 1B<i>,</i><b> </b>finishing in repeated blocks of octaves in 11B<i>.</i><b> </b>"

Piano 4 soon enters with repeated open octaves while Piano 3 provides cadenza-like passages. Piano 5 is last to enter with extended trills and brief, rapid scalar phrases in contrary motion which, before long, transform into a swiftly swirling passage.

Darna is a superhero who defends a provincial town from evil spirits and demons such as <i>aswang </i>(witch)<i>, manananggal (</i>selfsegmenting ghoul)<i>, impakta </i>(vampire), and other lowly blood-thirsty mythical creatures. In the song, the male persona reveals his desire to be Narda&rsquo;s paramour. He wonders if Narda, who is desired by all, would even notice him. He goes as far as contemplating falling into a ravine so that Narda&rsquo;s double, Darna, might rescue him and he can be in her embrace for a few precious seconds.

It is in a slow, deliberate tempo punctuated by the steady drum beat and heavy strumming of the lead guitars. Jay Contreras&rsquo;s pained, raw vocals, which carry the jumpy melodic line, are juxtaposed with the grating baritone drone of members of the band, resulting in vocal and instrumental cacophony.

It is composed for 241 performers and was premiered on 24 Jan 1968 at the University of the Philippines (UP) Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice, by the Ellinwood Chancel Choir, Far Eastern University Glee Club, University of the East Mixed Concert Chorus, students of the UP Conservatory of Music, UP Christian Youth Movement Choir, UP Madrigal Singers, UP Mixed Concert Chorus, and UP Student Catholic Action. <b><i><strong>Pagsamba</strong> </i></b>was performed in Bonn, West Germany in 1980 and had a repeat in the same UP Chapel, with reduced number of performers, in early 2000s.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Described by the composer himself as music for a religious ritual, this piece is however more art than religion, except that the two share the idea of ritual. This is Maceda&rsquo;s fourth major work after <b><i>Ugma-ugma</i></b>, premiered in Los Angeles in 1963; <b><i>Agungan</i></b>, 1966; and <b><i>Kubing</i></b>, 1966. It is scored for 100 singers symbolizing the &ldquo;people,&rdquo; 100 instrumentalists playing five types of indigenous Philippine instruments (whistles, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/805\">buzzers</a>, sticks, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/806\">clappers</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/826\">scrapers</a>), eight <b>gandingan</b> (gongs with shallow rims), eight <b>agung</b> (gongs with deep rims), and five male choirs, each consisting of five members. In its premiere, the work took advantage of the circular space of the UP Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice. The work was built as a general concept of communal, participative music in which the boundaries separating between artists and audience are breached. The even distribution of musical forces in a circle negates the concept of &ldquo;political&rdquo; hierarchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Heavily influenced by the avant-garde, post-serial music movement championed by Edgar Varese, Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and by the late 1950s French <b>musique concrete</b> idiom spearheaded by Pierre Schaffer in Paris, <b><i>Pagsamba</i></b> puts primary focus on the interplay of the musical element of timbre and on the layering of sound masses. High and low voices of the 100-member choir, intoning &ldquo;thick&rdquo; and &ldquo;thin&rdquo; sonorities are juxtaposed with the smaller vocal ensembles, whose members chant, half-sing, and mumble disjointed vocables from the liturgical text. These contrasting atmospheric blocks of vocal sounds further contrast with the indeterminate sound strata of instruments, some of which articulate sustained sound events while others produce short sound attacks with no decays. The layering and interaction of these sound colors create &ldquo;transparent,&rdquo; &ldquo;opaque,&rdquo; &ldquo;diffused&rdquo; sound &ldquo;screens&rdquo; and &ldquo;clouds,&rdquo; a musical organization that is inimical to closed conventional Western musical forms built on tonal harmonic principles. Depending where one is physically positioned in performing and listening to this piece, sound experience is unique or contingent on the position of that performer or listener, an aural specificity that creates what Maceda calls &ldquo;a stereophony of live sounds.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The malleability in the individual aural experiencing and the indeterminacy in the sound layering finds a parallel in the setting of the text, which does not strive for intelligibility in the words. This flexibility also means that the Mass can be performed in any language and the acoustic instruments can be substituted with electronic gadgets, whose soundwaves can emit from 241 amplified speakers in a circle. Embodied in this piece is a philosophy of ritual, which emphasizes human capital, joint work or social cooperation, in which individuals can be substituted for each other or by instruments, as long as collective participation is maintained. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

High and low voices of the 100-member choir, intoning &#x201C;thick&#x201D; and &#x201C;thin&#x201D; sonorities are juxtaposed with the smaller vocal ensembles, whose members chant, half-sing, and mumble disjointed vocables from the liturgical text. These contrasting atmospheric blocks of vocal sounds further contrast with the indeterminate sound strata of instruments, some of which articulate sustained sound events while others produce short sound attacks with no decays. The layering and interaction of these sound colors create &#x201C;transparent,&#x201D; &#x201C;opaque,&#x201D; &#x201C;diffused&#x201D; sound &#x201C;screens&#x201D; and &#x201C;clouds,&#x201D; a musical organization that is inimical to closed conventional Western musical forms built on tonal harmonic principles. Depending where one is physically positioned in performing and listening to this piece, sound experience is unique or contingent on the position of that performer or listener, an aural specificity that creates what Maceda calls &#x201C;a stereophony of live sounds.&#x201D;"

				"value": "The malleability in the individual aural experiencing and the indeterminacy in the sound layering finds a parallel in the setting of the text, which does not strive for intelligibility in the words. This flexibility also means that the Mass can be performed in any language and the acoustic instruments can be substituted with electronic gadgets, whose soundwaves can emit from 241 amplified speakers in a circle. Embodied in this piece is a philosophy of ritual, which emphasizes human capital, joint work or social cooperation, in which individuals can be substituted for each other or by instruments, as long as collective participation is maintained. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

It is based on motives from the <b><i>Missa Regia</i></b><i>,</i> the third mass in the collection <b><i>Cinq messes en plein-chant</i></b>, 1669, by the Flemish composer Henri Du Mont. Composed between 1901 and 1903, the <b><i>Peque&ntilde;a <strong>Misa</strong></i></b> was performed for the first time at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a> on 28 Aug 1904 by the Rizal Orchestra conducted by the composer. The original scores of this work have been lost but two modern settings, based on two sets of parts copied by students of Adonay&mdash;Alejandro Macabasco and Ceferino Pasang&mdash;which were found in the Pakil Parish Church archives, have been reconstructed and published in <b><i>The Life and Works of Marcelo Adonay</i></b>, 2010.

The unifying element of the mass&mdash;the use of the opening motive of the <b><i>Missa Regia</i></b> in four of the <b><i>Peque&ntilde;a Misa</i></b> movements and scattered references to other motives from the Dumont work in the body of the Gloria&mdash;is reminiscent of the compositional technique of the motto cycle/motto mass of the 15th to 17th centuries. This grounding in traditional form is set against the high Romantic idiomatic language found in the work. The passionate and emotional quality of the harmonies and rhythms and the exuberant orchestration of the music, especially in the Gloria and Agnus Dei, firmly establishes the composition as part of a late 19th century development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Peque&ntilde;a Misa</i></b> has been performed on a number of occasions.

Two other performances&mdash;at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/331\">Malate Church</a> on 23 Nov 1941 as part of the celebration of the Malate town fiesta and at the Quiapo Church on 23 Jun 1946 to celebrate the liberation of Manila&mdash;were conducted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\">Antonio Molina</a>, an admirer of the older composer. These were sponsored by the Amihan Society, which counted as members the composer&rsquo;s daughter and son-in-law, Marietta Adonay Cadsawan and Paulino Cadsawan, respectively. A performance at the San Miguel Pro Cathedral on 5 Oct 1953 was also conducted by Molina for Centro Escolar College. After a hiatus of 46 years, the work experienced a revival. It was performed on 1 Mar 1999, at the San Agustin Church with Herminigildo Ra&ntilde;era conducting the Coro Tomasino, the Liturgikon Choir, and the Chamber Orchestra of the University of Santo Tomas, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4072\">Fr Manuel P.

Feliciano avers that the failure to understand each other&rsquo;s culture on the part of both Muslim and Christian Filipinos is what created the conflict. The trilogy pays homage to the traditional musical artistry of Muslims.

Dedicated to Se&ntilde;orita Maxima Alas, the work is a pianistic treatment of 19 traditional Philippine musical and dance genres, including Spanish dances that had been incorporated into Philippine culture of that time: 1) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/787\"><b>pandangguhan</b></a> (in the style of fandango); 2) <b>bayuhan</b> (rice pounding rhythm); 3) <b>palimos</b> (beggar&rsquo;s song); 4) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>cundiman</b></a> (acculturated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> folk dance/song); 5) <b>auit</b> (Tagalog song in <b>plosa</b> verse form); 6) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><b>cumintang</b></a> (Tagalog dance-song, variant of auit, also in <b>plosa</b> verse form); 7) <i>virgoire</i> (folk dance); 8) <b>balinta</b>; 9) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><b>pasion</b></a> (chant to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a> text); 10) <b>tagulaylay</b> (Tagalog lament); 11) <b>dalit</b> (devotional hymn); 12) <i>zapateado</i> (Spanish dance featuring rhythmic footwork); 13) <b>bantayanun</b> (in the style of music from a fortress or <i>bantayan</i>); 14) <b>jele-jele</b> (lullaby); 15) <b>holona</b> (lullaby); 16) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><i>balitaw</i></a> (Visayan dance song, like cundiman); 17) <b>cabiquingan</b>; 18) <i>paruparuhan</i> (butterfly dance); and 19) <b>talindao</b> (boat-rowing song).</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The work has survived in two extant copies.

Molina</a>. This copy bears his note, stating that the work could not have been composed in 1750. The second of the two extant copies is a print in the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa&ntilde;a (BNE) which is dated 1900. Music historian Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as, however, has dated the work to 1886 (Ba&ntilde;as 1970, 39). This is a more probable date as the piece was reportedly exhibited in the 1887 Exposicion General de las Islas Filipinas in Madrid which explains why BNE has a copy of the print.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The printed version has an expensive chromolithographic cover page.

Perez as a <i>compositor de piano</i> (piano repairer). According to writer Alfredo Roa (Roa 1927, Vol. III, 457), Diego Perez was a piano teacher who was a generation older than Pedro Casta&ntilde;eda of Santa Cruz, who tutored the Filipina zarzuela<i> </i>star <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2936\">Praxedes Fernandez de Pastor</a> (La Yeyeng) (ibid, 456).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The piece is remarkable for two reasons. First, Diego Perez included music and dance genres that were no longer heard in the 20th century such as the balinta and the talindao. Second, this piano medley is a valuable reference to traditional Philippine music of the late 19th century.

One-act <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3910\">Ladislao S. Bonus</a>.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The original Spanish libretto, titled <b><i>La Alianza So&ntilde;ada</i>,</b> was written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5576\">Pedro A. Paterno</a> and was later translated into Tagalog by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5643\">Roman G. Reyes</a> with the title, <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/997\">Sangdugong Panaguinip</a></i>. The opera was first translated into English by Arthur W. Fergusson, then Executive Secretary to Civil Governor William H. Taft. Another translation of the libretto in English by Col Walter H. Loving of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\">Philippine Constabulary Band</a> was later published by the Imprenta de R. Mercantil de J. Loyzaga (Santiago 2009, 79). It was premiered on 2 Aug 1902 with the Orquesta Molina conducted by Ladislao Bonus assisted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2817\">Alejo Carluen</a> at the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a> to a full-house, with 1,500 seats sold in advance. Among the celebrated local singers who performed the principal roles were Juana Molina, Julian Benito, and Patricio Loyola. The opera ran for at least eight performances at the Teatro Zorrilla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Sangdugong Panaguinip</i></b> expresses a strong pro-American sentiment as it was written to legitimize America&rsquo;s intrusive presence in the country. According to Rivera, the work was &ldquo;regarded as a propaganda opera advocating American rule in the archipelago&rdquo; (Rivera 2009, 89). At the inaugural performance, the theater was draped with numerous American flags, and it was attended by a number of high American civil officials, among whom were Taft, Fergusson, and Loving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A short synopsis written by Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as (1969, 202-3) reads:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextall-indent\" style=\"margin-right:.25in; text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt 0.25in\"><span style=\"text-justify:inter-ideograph\">A band of Muslims invades Luzon and imposes taxes or tribute on every maiden in the towns of Pasig, Cainta and Antipolo, Rizal. Led by Lapu, the inhabitants of these towns were unified by way of a blood compact so as to repel the invaders. One night while pondering his plan to conquer the Muslims, Lapu fell asleep in a cave known as the cave of Do&ntilde;a Geronima. He dreamt of having seen a rainbow with rays leading to paradise and illuminated by a constellation of American stars. Lapu saw an American-Pilipino alliance, which under Bathala&rsquo;s guidance could lead to prosperity and happiness of his people.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The play is an allegory using characters as symbols of political and social forces working in the Philippines to cement the relationship between the United States and the Philippines, described in the libretto as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the first scene, while Lapu is asleep, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestra</a> plays the Spanish March while a woman representing Spain appears on the scene, embraces the Filipino woman and points out the road to progress... The &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; is played afterwards as the scene changes and the Statue of Liberty looms in the background. What seemed at first to be a comet grows into a group of stars forming the Filipino flag. The orchestra then plays the Philippine national anthem to conclude the play, the Filipinos embracing the Statue of Liberty representing the United States (Fernandez and Tiongson 1994, 235).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music of <b><i>Sangdugong Panaguinip</i></b> was written for orchestra and various vocal parts. There are nine vocal solo parts: one <b>tiple</b>, one <b>tiple soprano</b>, one <b>primer baritono</b>, two <b>tenores</b>, two <b>tenor partiquino</b><i> </i>(small parts), one <b>segundo baritono</b>, and a <b>bajo</b><i>.</i> There is also a chorus that plays an important role in the unfolding of the narrative. Among the orchestral instruments specified in the reduced score for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> were <b>cornetos</b> (horns), <b>cornetinos</b> (small trumpet), <b>fagot</b> (bassoon), <b>bombo platillo</b> (bass drum), <b>trompetas</b> (trumpets), and <b>caja vivo</b> (small drum) (Rivera 2009, 98). The arias and choruses are predominantly set in dance rhythms such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><b>balitaw</b></a>, danza, and <b>marcha</b>, and they are mostly through-composed following the poetic flow of the verses (Rivera 2009, 99-100).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musical score is divided into five scenes, introduced by a <b>sinfonia</b> (orchestral overture) in four distinct sections with differing tempi, key signatures, and character. Remarkable in the first scene is the superimposition of the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner&rdquo; on the &ldquo;Marcha Nacional Filipina&rdquo; in the dream sequence.

It was subsequently nominated in the Song of the Year category and Video of the Year category in the 2007 NU Rock Awards. It was also nominated in the Favorite Music Video category in the 2008 MYX Music Awards. <b><i>Blush </i></b>received a Gold Record award after a special edition CD album was released in 2007.

First performed by Up Dharma Down featuring Millare on vocals and keyboards, Carlos Ta&ntilde;ada on lead <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitars</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/829\">synthesizers</a>, Ean Mayor on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a> and samplers, and Paul Yap on bass and synthesizers. The song is included in UDD&rsquo;s album <b><i>Capacities</i></b>, released in 2012 under Terno Productions.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a low, dreamy tune, vivid imagery, and deep poetic lyrics, &ldquo;Tadhana&rdquo; is about the aching, one-sided affection that the persona feels towards someone she loves. The aching is depicted musically in the introduction and first verse by an unsettling, sequence of chords which are syncopated and not in root position, i.e., F#/B-C#-C#/D#-F#/C#-F#B-C#-C#/D#. In the verse leading to the chorus, another chord pattern moves in half note duration, with supporting &ldquo;walking bass&rdquo; (B-C#-D#-minor-F#) as if to project the itch of the lover crying for attention. In the chorus, the lover&rsquo;s plea heightens with the insistent pounding of chords to re-iterate the lover&rsquo;s plight. This emotion then melts into noise, conveyed by the mixed-up, distorted electronica section that serves as a bridge to the second verse. Though the form of the song is highly structured into &ldquo;square,&rdquo; eight-bar phrasings, the &ldquo;groggy&rdquo; timbre of the voice of the song&rsquo;s protagonist suits the character of a lover, probably an urbanite (judging from the diction), whose desire he or she cannot suppress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the last verse, a favorite among fans, the persona urges anyone who is in love to express his true feelings:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ba&rsquo;t di pa sabihin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang hindi mo maamin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ipauubaya na lang ba &rsquo;to sa hangin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&rsquo;Wag mong ikatakot</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang bulong ng damdamin mo</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Naririto ako&rsquo;t nakikinig sa&rsquo;yo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">(Why not say</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">What you cannot confess</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Are you going to leave this to the winds</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Do not be afraid</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To whisper your feelings</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">I&rsquo;m here, listening to you.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An extended version of the song is usually done by the band in their gigs.
