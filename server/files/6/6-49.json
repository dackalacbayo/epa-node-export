Premiered on 1 Sep 1951 at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. Restaged on 27 Aug 1953 at the Far Eastern University Auditorium under the auspices of the ManilaSymphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When first done, it marked the return of the Zippers to Manila after an absence of three years since 1947, and was considered the most ambitious dance project at that time and an unprecedented development in dance scenario in the Philippines. The first production alsocommemorated the 32nd anniversary of the Asociacion<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>deFilipinas.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choreography was conceived as an imaginative combination of classical ballet and modern dance. Hippolyta and the Fairies of Dawn danced on pointes, while the rest of the cast danced in character shoes or on bare feet. Philippine<em>jusi</em>was used for the costumes of Titania and the fairies. Scenic projection was introduced. Tights&mdash;then hardly available locally, pointe shoes, makeup, backdrop paintings, orchestral scores, musical instruments, and other equipment were donated from New York.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foremost ballet schools in Manila agreed to dance together in one production. These were RemediosdeOteyza&rsquo;s Classical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Academy, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>taKane&rsquo;s School of the Classic Dance, Pacita Madrigal-Warns&rsquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2405\"><strong>Manila Ballet</strong></a> Academy, Benjamin and Remedios Villanueva&rsquo;s YWCA Ballet School, and the ballet dancers of the University of the Philippines. They were joined by noted professionals and students. The amateur dancers were transformed into expressive dancers in three months through the skill of the choreographer. The cast was an impressive total of 64 dancers, with a 23-member women&rsquo;s choir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1953 restaging, the narrator was Gerard A. Burke, an Irish actor for stage, television, and radio. RicardoCassell&rsquo;s StudioDanceGroup replaced the defunct Manila Ballet Academy. Jose Velez was Theseus, Ging Severino was Hippolyta, Jack <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a> was Lysander, Alcuin Pastrano was Demetrius, Hetty McKay was Hermia, EddieElejar was Oberon, and Rally Calvo was Bottom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AliceReyes used the same Shakespearean story in her own three-scene version also to Mendelssohn, premiered on 3 Sep 1976 by the CCP Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (now BalletPhilippines) at the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines (CCP). Reyes starts with the quarrel of the Fairy King and Queen, Oberon and Titania, but over a Chinese (Joseph Na&ntilde;as) rather than an Indian boy. The role of Puck was portrayed by TonyFabella, Oberon by NonoyFroilan, and Titania by EffieNa&ntilde;as.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EdnaVida premiered her own <strong><em>A Midsummer</em></strong><strong><em>Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong> on 16 Mar 1989 for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a> at the CCP. It was a one-act ballet in 10 scenes. Instead of starting with Oberon and Titania, Vida opened the ballet with the case of the four lovers being reviewed by the Athenean king and queen Theseus and Hippolyta upon the request of Hermia&rsquo;s father, Egeus. She restored the Indian boy in the rivalry between Oberon and Titania, and calls Bottom and his companions the laborers. At the end, when harmony is restored, Oberon and Titania enter the court of Theseus and Hippolyta in the celebration of a triple wedding, and Puck dances into the happy night. Froilan reprised his role of Oberon while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2627\"><strong>Sofia Zobel</strong></a> danced the role of Titania and ConradDy-Liacco the role of Puck. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Corazon G.

The illness of the king, for example, is symbolic of the State&rsquo;s moral deterioration. The ballet also transforms the magical bird into an enchanted princess. Act 1 starts in the kingdom of Palanyag where Raha Magpantay (The Just) and his wife Bai Liwanag (The Enlightened) live with their three sons&mdash;Malakas (The Strong), Makisig (The Handsome), and Mabait (The Good). All is peaceful until the king dreams that Mabait has been mauled by two villains. He falls ill and the court physician advises that only the song of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/148\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1880\"><strong>Ibong Adarna</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> can cure him. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> after the other, the three sons go to Bundok Tabor in search of the magical bird. When it is Mabait&rsquo;s turn, he saves the firefly Ningning, as she is beset by a<em>kapre</em>(tobacco-smoking ogre) and<em>higante</em>(giant). In gratitude, Ningning brings him to a celebration of Kislap, queen of the fireflies and the air spirits; Kaapoan, king of the dwarfs and the earth spirits; and Kalipay, queen of the fairies and the water spirits. They all advise the prince on how to capture the Adarna. It lives in Batong Pilak, sings seven seductive songs, and scatters its droppings. The song lulls the listener to sleep while the droppings turn him to stone. Mabait is given a golden knife with which to cut himself, and seven bitter<em>dayap</em>(lime) to keep him awake, a golden cage for the Adarna, as well as living water to pour over the stones beneath the bird&rsquo;s tree. He flies off with Ningning in a magical vinta, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5157\"><strong>Caracoa</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 reveals the rainbow-hued Adarna to Mabait as an enchanted princess, Bai Marilag, princess of the kingdom of Kawayan, who refused her father&rsquo;s choice for a husband and was condemned to live as a bird until loved by one pure of heart. As Mabait pursues her, he hears the Adarna&rsquo;s seven songs depicting the seven human frailties: lust, pride, envy, sloth, avarice, gluttony, and anger. Kept awake by Ningning and the pain of his dayap-soaked wounds, Mabait captures the Adarna. Ningning pours water on the stones beneath the tree and the brothers Malakas and Makisig come back to life. But they ungratefully maul Mabait and sail away with the Adarna. The abandoned Mabait is healed by Kislap who helps him fly back to his father&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malakas and Makisig are hailed in Palanyag, but the Adarna refuses to sing to cure the king. Mabait descends from the sky amid thunder and lightning, and the Adarna starts to sing. The king revives, banishes his two villainous sons, and names Mabait his heir. The Adarna turns back into Bai Marilag and marries Mabait. <strong><em>Adarna</em></strong> is the second attempt to use the folkloric material of the korido. This version was especially important in charting directions for Philippine dance, as its libretto was Filipinized and utilized ethnic motifs and movements. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em></em></strong><strong><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

The setting is 19th century Manila, a city to which young men were returning from Europe bringing with them the Age of Byron, instead of the Age of Victoria. Traditional male dominance is suddenly shaken by the summer solstice<em>tadtarin</em>ritual that climaxes on the feast of Saint John the Baptist. Women suddenly reign supreme, and dark frenzied rites celebrate death and resurrection; primitive impulses shatter the veneer of urbanity, and Hispanic molds and patterns. In the end, Don Rafael prostrates himself before Amada&rsquo;s feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a student at Sarah Lawrence University, Reyes presented <strong><em>Amada</em></strong> as her master&rsquo;s thesis in 1969.

Kasilag</strong></a>&rsquo;s music for the ballet is atonal and serial with irregular rhythmic meters of fives and sevens. She uses intermittent percussive sounds of drums, sticks and gongs, and piano that had no definite melody, giving the effect of tension and irresolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The choreography has a distinct Spanish flavor, especially in the solo variations of <strong><em>Amada</em></strong>, and Filipino ethnic movements, juxtaposed with the strong influence of Martha Graham in the dramatic sections of the tadtarin rituals. Reyes&rsquo;s first major modern choreographic work elicited mixed reactions from the critics and audiences then, but has now emerged as a milestone in Filipino modern dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Amada</em></strong> was performed in the Visayan Summer Dance Tour in Apr 1970; at the Shell House in London, United Kingdom in Jun 1972; at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> de la Zarzuela in Madrid, Spain, where the company opened the Afro-Asiatic Festival in Jul 1972; at the 50th anniversary celebration of the American Dance Festival in Durham, North Carolina in Jun 1984; and in other countries like the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Greece, and various Southeast Asian countries. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Only the brave Isabel dares go to the mirror; it reflects her own image, and that of a young man. She enters the mirror, and another world, where there is a ball. She imitates her image dancing with the man, in a pas de trois. Taking the man for herself, she performs a pas de deux with him and is part of that world for a while. In the end, she must return to her own world. In reality, she is found sprawled before the mirror holding a candle; no one believes her story. Alone, she returns to the mirror that shows her the same man, but now cold, conceited, and cruel. Yet she accepts him and her fate.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</em></strong> </p>\r\n"

Act 1 opens with Andres dancing a solo to Bonifacio&rsquo;s own &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1918\"><strong>Pag-ibig sa Tinubuang Lupa</strong></a>&rdquo; (Love for the Motherland), with voice over narration by actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2956\"><strong>Joonee Gamboa</strong></a>. The supremo then rallies his countrymen in &ldquo;Sandugo&rdquo; (Blood Pact). The male members of the ensemble slash their arms to symbolize their pledge of brotherhood in the Katipunan. The civil guards, led by an arrogant Spanish general, walk through the town, while the womenfolk busy themselves to conceal the activities of the newly-formed revolutionary army. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the women is Oryang, or Gregoria de Jesus, with whom Andres falls in love. They get married in a typical rural Filipino celebration, with guests dancing with <strong>kumintang</strong> (circular or wavelike hand movements from the wrist) gestures and sway balance steps. After this, a trio shows how Teodoro and Honoria Pati&ntilde;o divulge the Katipunan&rsquo;s activities to a Spanish friar. Upstage in silhouette, Katipunan members witness the revolutionary wedding of Bonifacio and Oryang.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>A tableau of oppressed Filipinos is strategically placed to resemble the mise-en-scene in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Spoliarium</em></strong>. Andres looks at the tableau and is inflamed to launch the revolution to liberate his countrymen. In a sequence of dances, Bonifacio calls on the Katipunan brothers and sisters who wave Katipunan flags, tear up their cedula at Balintawak, take up arms, and rush forward toward the audience in a cry of battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 opens with the fighting seen in slow motion through clouds of smoke and strobe lights. The smoke of battle clears to show a wasteland of bodies, with the survivors tending to the wounded or burying their dead. Andres takes his wife and brothers to Cavite to mediate in the struggle between the Magdalo and the Magdiwang factions. But an unnamed general orders his men to arrest and torture the Bonifacio brothers and rape Oryang,even as Aguinaldo stands and moves with authoritative arrogance as head of the dictatorial government. Bonifacio&rsquo;s death is symbolically portrayed. He is tied to a swing, which rises over the stage spot where the Magdalo soldiers raped his wife. From that swing, he sees the atrocities below. A shot rings out and Andres is killed. The dance ends with revolutionaries dancing to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1415\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo; (My Country). They hand over the Philippine flag to a living Gregoria de Jesus, who walks toward the audience, offering the flag to the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Andres KKK</em></strong> was restaged at the CCP in 1997 and 2008, and had outreach performances in 1998.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

Cast: Rey Formacion (Bangotbanwa), Raoul Ca&ntilde;onero (Datu Sumakwel), Geraldine Montelibano (Kapinangan), and Fundador Tan (Gurong-gurong).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story weaves together tales and incidents from pre-Spanish and Spanish colonial times, focusing on the role of the<em>babaylan</em>or shaman&mdash;Bangotbanwa in Act 1, and the female and male babaylanes in Act 2, who lead the people in struggling against the Spanish authorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance drama in two acts highlights crucial spoken dialogues, but it is mostly told in dance inspired by folk practices. Occupational dances are interspersed with ritual and combat scenes. The ritual dances are performed with bolo and capes, china bowls, palaspas (palm fronds), and the manangyad (legendary long necklace) of Kapinangan, Datu Sumakwel&rsquo;s wife. Love dances, a spring ritual dance with fairies, and Kapinangan&rsquo;s bath are more stylized, as is a mimetic dance between a boar and Sumakwel&rsquo;s aide, Gurong-gurong. Act 2 dramatizes a series of encounters between the natives headed by a succession of babaylan, and the Spanish civil and religious authorities. Seemingly ending in the defeat of the rebels, a youthful babaylan rises over dead bodies to martial their spirits, promising to invigorate the next generation that will reassert its claims for freedom. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Choreography, <u><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2462\">TonyFabella</a></strong> </u>; libretto, RamonP.Santos; music, Igor Stravinsky; lighting direction, MoninoDuque; set design, AmielLeonardia; costume design, Alfonso Guinoo. Premiered by the University of the Philippines College of Music Dance Ensemble on 2 Dec 1982 at the Main Theater, now the Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>, of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. Dancers: AnnaVilladolid (Bride), LutherPerez (Groom), Ianne Damian and Jojo Isorena (Parents of the Bride), Leila Florentino and Rey Magnaye (Parents of the Groom).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet cantata is adapted from <strong><em>Les Noces</em></strong>,a traditional Russian wedding, which was premiered by the Ballet Russe de Diaghilev on 13 Jun 1923 at Theatre Gaite-Lyrique, Paris. Originally choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska, there are other versions by Jerome Robbins, Lar Lubovitch, and Jiri Kylian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against a cyclorama are bold pylons of intersecting beams before which the chorus stands on tall risers, set off by four grand pianos and a percussion ensemble. These are visible through a gauze curtain across the whole stage and a central boulder-platform. To the right are the bride and her bridesmaids forming a wedge, and to the left are the groom and his friends, forming another wedge. As the chorus sings, the sitting bride moves anxiously as though doing her hair. Her maids imitate her, assure, surround and turn her round and round. They all move out on space, still mirroring the bride&rsquo;s anxiety and sustaining her. The bride&rsquo;s mother comes to support her. The maids adorn the bride&rsquo;s arms and hide her. The standing groom and his friends move assertively. The friends wind a long headband around the groom as they go round and round him. His father blesses him and his mother gives him a long necklace. Led by the airborne groom, the men dance further out in space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The parties of the bride and groom gradually cross each other&rsquo;s spaces led by the respective parents. The bride&rsquo;s mother dances a solo of grief. The respective parties return decked with grand ceremonial headdresses, Bukidnon style, followed by the similarly bedecked bride and groom with their long trains and capes. The gauze curtain opens on all, starkly revealing the singers, musicians, and high beams. The bride and groom flank a priest before whom the parents kneel and link arms, and the bridesmaids and friends lie prostrate. The bride and groom also link hands, blessed by the priest with a long scarf. As they go upstage, the rest dance in jubilation downstage. The bride and groom ascend the boulder-platform. Alone, the bride gradually strips herself of adornments and clothes, as though following a prescribed ritual that she both fears and submits to. When the groom returns naked, she is the more afraid, needing his reassurance. A male solo seems to still everything. Finally, all that remain are the pianos, lights hanging from the beams, and the bride and groom standing still and looking at each other. The ballet is commended for the adaptation of Stravinsky&rsquo;s <strong><em>Les Noces</em></strong> to a Philippine setting and the establishment of cultural parallelisms between the Bukidnon indigenous group and the Russian peasantry.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Premiere of the full ballet on 26 Sep 2002, also by UP Dance Company.

At the premiere, the Filipino translation by Ramon Santos was sung live by soprano Aileen Espinosa Cura, mezzo soprano Janet Sabas Aracama, tenor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4062\"><strong>Jonathan Malicsi</strong></a>, bass Reuel Tica, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4204\"><strong>UP Concert Chorus</strong></a>; accompanied by pianists Benjamin Dia, Carolyn Kleiner Cheng, Beverly Shangkuan, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3912\"><strong>Mauricia Borromeo</strong></a>; and percussionists Leo Roque, Gomer Giron, Aimee Mina, Francis Miranda, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Lazaga, and Noel Villanueva.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The production is actually the second <strong><em>Ang Kasal</em></strong>. In 1982, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2462\"><strong>Tony Fabella</strong></a> created a Filipinized version of Nijinska&rsquo;s <strong><em>Les Noces</em></strong>, set to Stravinsky&rsquo;s music, but using traditional Bukidnon rituals and culture. Even then, there were parallels between the indigenous Filipino traditions and the Russian peasant marriage customs as outlined in Nijinska&rsquo;s work. Both Fabella&rsquo;s and Fernandez&rsquo;s versionsfollow the storyline of <strong><em>Les Noces</em></strong>, with the families of the bride and the groom preparing for the nuptial. The choreography by Fernandez, however, uses the cultural practices of the Cordilleran communities which are similar to the Russian peasant customs. Instead of the Russian folk symbolism of the braided hair joining the families, the dancers move around the bride and groom, mimicking how the people of the Cordillera dance in circular formation while playing their gongs in both festive and solemn celebrations. Instead of the traditional gong beat, the dancers move to Stravinsky whose opus was synchronized with the rhythmic structure and impulses of traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While performed barefoot, there are still balletic elements in the movement, with <strong>sissonnes</strong> (jump like scissors), <strong>glissade</strong> s (joining steps), and <strong>pas de bourrees</strong> (beating steps) used alternatively with the shuffling movements of Cordilleran dance. The vocabulary, however, was also more modern in its successful fusion of the balletic, modern, and traditional styles. The intensity of the dancing, as dictated both by the traditional Cordilleran impulses and by the music of Stravinsky, is what makes Fernandez&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Kasal</em></strong> impressive and memorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Ang Kasal</em></strong> was restaged twice in Kuala Lumpur: in Aug 2003 for the ASEAN Theatre Festival at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, then in 2007 at the Tari International Festival at Akademi Seni Budaya Dan Warisan Kebangsaan (National Academy for Arts and Culture). Japheth Mari Cabling and Angella Betina Carlos restaged the work as part of their graduation recital for the UP College of Music Dance program in Mar 2013. Eunice Velasco and Minette Caryl Maza alternated as the bride, Jeiel Hernandez and Joshua Pinca alternated as the groom, Michael Barry Que and Mark Robles alternated as the groom&rsquo;s father, and Aries Joy Manlapaz and Carissa Carmel Estrada alternated as the bride&rsquo;s mother.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

The setting is Lucban, Quezon in the 1920s. The events transpire during the feast of the farmer&rsquo;s saint San Isidro Labrador, when the town is decorated with food products and the special<em>kiping</em>, paper-thin translucent rice fritters, brightly colored and shaped like leaves. Act 1 opens on Mother Simeona and her adventurous daughter, Lisa, who consorts with Kulas despite the mother&rsquo;s restrictions. Lisa&rsquo;s friends help her to escape every so often. But Simeona has plans for Lisa to marry Don Tomas&rsquo; butterfly-chasing son Alan, who is quite &ldquo;strange,&rdquo; except to Lisa&rsquo;s cousin, Ramona. A dance accentuating the<em>tapis</em>(overskirt) is performed in the first act. Act 2 features the feast and the procession, the<em>maglalatik</em>(coconut jam-maker) dance, and Simeona&rsquo;s flamenco from her<em>sarsuwela</em>days.Kulas and Lisa manage to be on their own, and Alan spots Ramona for himself. But a storm breaks out and everyone runs for cover. Act 3 opens with preparations for the wedding. Simeona looks over Lisa&rsquo;s dress. Meanwhile baskets of farm products are brought into Simeona&rsquo;s house for the wedding. Simeona leaves for a while but locks up the house. But the clever Kulas has hidden himself among the baskets and surprises Lisa. Hearing her mother&rsquo;s return, Lisa hides Kulas in her room. Suspicious, Simeona orders Lisa into her room, not knowing that Kulas is there. When Don Tomas and Alan arrive, the young lovers are found together in Lisa&rsquo;s room. After a fainting spell, Simeona has to agree to their wedding, and to Ramona and Alan&rsquo;s. Don Tomas then asks for Simeona&rsquo;s hand. A triple wedding ends the ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/118\"><strong>Ang Pilya</strong></a></em></strong> is the first Filipino adaptation of the original 1789 Dauberval ballet set in a French provincial town. The premiere of <strong><em>Pilya</em></strong> drew positive reviews forVelasco&rsquo;s adaptation of the 1789 <strong><em>La Fille Mal Gardee</em></strong> because itdeveloped the comedy and commentary of the ballet. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2542\"><strong>William Morgan</strong></a>, combining Hertel and Herold&rsquo;s scores, outsmarted himself with one of his most captivating choreographies, and with his own excellent portrayal of Simeona that entertained the audiences. The occupational<em>maglalatik</em>dance stood on its own and developed Simeona&rsquo;s shawl-seducing flamenco; both beguile like the clog dance in Frederick Ashton&rsquo;s classic.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

The sultan is loftily borne by his men, among them the commoner who falls in love with the sultan&rsquo;s daughter. The princess is surrounded by her handmaidens or guarded by the sultan himself. But the lovers meet in a pas de deux highlighted by supported poses and lifts. The commoner-lover is flogged, and the sultan decides to execute him with a lance. But as the sultan throws the weapon, the princess runs between the weapon and her lover, is pierced, and dies. The villagers turn away from the sultan, carry the princess away, and leave the sultan alone to grieve.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>There was an earlier version of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/119\"><strong>Ang Sultan</strong></a></em></strong> titled <strong><em>Patriarch</em></strong>,set to music by Alan Hovahness.

Dancers: Rebecca Rodriguez (aggressive woman), AnnaVilladolid (desperate woman), Del Caragan (man), and Susan Atizado (third woman).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a></em></strong> is a multimedia piece for four singers, three guitars, percussions, four dancers, a movable set, and special lights. As described by the composer, <strong><em>Awit</em></strong> is expression as perceived in various levels of consciousness through the different phenomena of silence, sound, light, melody, shape, motion, and space. Its depth is projected in the constant permutations in duration, intensity, the brightness and dimness of colors, lyricism, simplicity, complexity, gestures and accents, illusion, and reality. It derives its spirit from the music molded by years of living traditions and its totality is realized through the mystery of the human voice and the metaphor of the human body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance happens on four overlapping ovular platforms that are echoed by four screen panels. Split pieces of one ovular idea, the screens are lit from behind, the sides or the front. The dancers are seen through these rising and descending screens as they trace a maze and find their individual confining screens at the end. The four dancers&mdash;three females and one male&mdash;progress from swaying minimally together as one, to separating, disturbing, and supporting each other. Following the music&rsquo;s rise and fall, flow or stress, plucked accents or sustained rhythm, the dancers act out the following: an aggressive woman separates from the three, starts a combat with the man, and ends with them loving each other. Rejoining the two women behind, they make a foursome and do a rhythmic dance of linked hands, linked steps (canonic or unison), and crisscrossings, with Indian-style gestures and martial movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the music becomes spare, one desperate woman dances out a personal cry of her own. She breaks up the huddled trio and brings each one to crying gestures. To a renewed rhythmic play, the man dances out his own urgent solo that leads to the women carrying him about to soothe and sustain him. They all move back to the ovular platforms as the panels start descending; they take separate places behind their respective screens. As the music and lights gradually diminish, they sway separately and reach out in spurts. The guitars are plucked with finality and the voices trail away in the dark.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Dancers: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2476\"><strong>Gaye Galiluyo</strong></a> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/121\"><strong>Babalyan</strong></a>); Edmund Gaerlan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2575\"><strong>Dwight Rodrigazo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\"><strong>Alden Lugnasin</strong></a>, Gerald Mercado (attendants).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Babalyan</em>is the Tagbanwa terminology for<em>babaylan</em>, the Philippine term for &ldquo;shaman&rdquo; or &ldquo;priestess.&rdquo; Agnes Locsin used this word for the title of a 12-minute neo-ethnic dance she created for BP as entry to the 2nd Tokyo International Choreography Competition. It is based on a<em>pagdiwata</em>ritual from the Tagbanwa, an indigenous group of Palawan where Locsin did firsthand research on the ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance begins with the Babalyan in a trance, bathed by a single spotlight, using her hands and fingers as representations of the coconut leaves traditionally used by a babalyan for rituals. She slaps her hands on her thighs, pivots toward the four male dancers and jumps into a sitting position on the men who catch her and sway gently as an imaginary hammock. The ritual progresses with the cleansing of cutlery, represented by the male bodies, to be used in the ceremony. In the next segment, the Babalyan goes through the routine of warding off evil spirits surrounded by the male dancers whose movements are designed to protect her. In the dance&rsquo;s climax she uses angular and jerky movements to indicate her success in resisting the spirits and ends up lifted by the male dancers in a sitting position, quietly swaying like a hammock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Babalyan</em></strong> is one of Locsin&rsquo;s most creative and challenging dance pieces because she effectively uses plain movements, body parts, lighting, and music as representational elements in a pagdiwata ritual which traditionally requires a lot of material components. Her choreographic style is markedly neo-ethnic, but she pushes the boundaries of this medium to create a powerful and dramatic interpretation of the ritual. The music Locsin chose was Maki Ishii&rsquo;s <strong><em>Expressionen</em></strong>, one of the five music pieces pre-selected by the organizers. She collaborated and experimented with the five dancers for movement exploration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 24 Aug 1993, <strong><em>Babalyan</em></strong> won the Silver Medal at the 2nd Tokyo International Choreography Competition and for Locsin, the Prince Takamado Award for excellence in choreography. <strong><em>Babalyan</em></strong> has become part of BP&rsquo;s repertoire and has been restaged in numerous performances in the company&rsquo;s local and international tours.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Nestor O.

The work uses ethnic styles and values.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance centers on a bound sacrificial victim. Terrified, she can only stamp, twist, walk on her knees, roll, rise and fall, slowly, painfully, unable to use her arms. She dances to the unremitting drone of the music, with its humming and bellowing, flute and voice, shaken beat, and ostinato<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Against the victim are six Bagobo braves whom Locsin casts as women. Their severe black costumes, their Bagobo stance, steps, and rhythm eliminate all sexual bias. They move not like torturers but as an unequivocal natural force embodying the customary law enthroned by tribal traditions. Their choric power lies in their impersonal, almost supernatural, persona. They traverse the stage deliberately, ponderously as the victim runs around and amid them, incapable of escaping their hieratic poses and lunges. Their hands and stances are sculptural, almost monumental. Like a prisoner in the maze of the minotaur, the victim is trapped by the cruel inexorability of a supreme life-and-death code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neither narrative, literal nor ideological, the piece magically evokes the world of the numinous that the folk believe in. An intense experience that is uncompromising in the pursuit of its intent, its long-drawn ensemble process, heightened or attenuated at turns, creates a credible yet mysterious and primal world to which an urban audience is drawn.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Nestor O.

Their gloved arms add glamour for effect, but instead of heeled stilettos, they dance <strong>en pointe</strong>. After a brief unison, the ladies exit the dance floor and a series of solos follow, each different from the last, highlighting the natural gifts of each ballerina such as beautiful extensions, height, suppleness, rhythmic timing, sultriness, dramatic flair, or bravura. The ballet ends with all the girls on center stage, in a tableau of glamour poses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A shorter version was more regularly restaged after the premiere and was performed at the 20th anniversary of PBT in 2005.

Indigenous Kalinga dance. Performed by Sumadel and Mangali Kalinga at Licoutan village, Tanudan municipality, Kalinga province, to celebrate the transfer of a<em>bodong</em>, or peace pact, from father to son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kalinga culture group is composed of about 47<em>ili</em>, or subgroups. A subgroup may reside in several villages; the Mangali Kalinga, for example, reside in eight villages in the municipality of Tanudan in the southern part of Kalinga province. The bodong is an agreement forged and maintained by at least two Kalinga subgroups, such as the Mangali Kalinga and the Sumadel Kalinga, to ensure that peaceful relations between their members prevail. The establishment or renewal of a bodong is a prolonged ceremony with feasting, the playing of musical instruments, singing, and dancing. The galigad is the transfer of a bodong from a peace-pact holder to someone else, usually his son. Thus, the galigad guarantees the continuity of a bodong from one generation to the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The participants perform communal dances on a field that has been cleared by the host villagers for the festivities. The dances are the men&rsquo;s <strong>tadok</strong> / <strong>tachek</strong>, the women&rsquo;s <strong>sangni</strong>,and a male and female couple&rsquo;s <strong>seledsed/salidsid</strong>. A recent innovation is a choreographed dance performed on a stage but still consisting of the traditional foot and arm movements. The musical instruments accompanying these dances are the<em>gangsa</em>(gongs),<em>balladong</em>(flute), and<em>kullitong</em>(zither).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are at least two Kalinga subgroups participating in the three-day celebration: one subgroup hosts about fifty representatives of the other subgroup, who come to the host village as guests and partners in the peace-pact agreement. When the guests arrive at the host village, they are welcomed by a group of about six gangsa players doing the tadok/tachek as a greeting dance. The inclusion of one or two female player-dancers among the men is a contemporary deviation from tradition because the tadok is traditionally exclusive only to men. Their dance space is not yet the main area where the major scenes of the bodong or galigad ceremony will be performed in the next two days. Here, it is just big enough for the six dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tadok is the basic Kalinga dance movement and a formation of a single line of player-dancers. The leader is their best gangsa player with the ability to play the<em>sapul</em>, the elemental melody providing the steady rhythm of the five other player-dancers. He also determines which way their line will go, now snaking to the right, now to the left, now turning to face the other way and reversing the direction of the line, thus allowing the last in line to be the leader. The basic foot movement is the <strong>dasudas,</strong> in whichthe dancers stay in place while moving their feet and playing their gongs. For variety, they may do the <strong>dallokog</strong>, in which they bend low, with their gangsa hanging a few inches above the ground; and the <strong>angububuot,</strong> in whichthe leader and followers dance backward while keeping in line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the evening after supper, both hosts and guests celebrate the<em>dolnat</em>(to warm up) by dancing alternately till midnight. The women now join the men but they form their own line with their own dance movement called the &ldquo;sangni.&rdquo;While doing the dasudas, they use two arm movements alternately: the <strong>dopa</strong>,withthe arms outstretched and flapping like a flying bird&rsquo;s wings, and the <strong>angawak</strong>, with their hands on their hips. The dasudas is done continuously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first day of the celebration proper is the next day, consisting of a series of celebratory activities called the<em>inum</em>(to drink). The venue is outside the village, where the hosts have cleared a field to create a festival area for hundreds of participants. A stage for solo performances and the guests&rsquo; makeshift shelters are erected on this clearing. The sequence of activities is the following: the presentation of gifts composed of<em>dekot</em>(sticky rice cake) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a>-peso bills arranged to form several Philippine flags; tadok dancing; the bodong or galigad ritual; a choreographed dance; and another type of communal dancing performed in pairs. Except for the communal dancing, all these are done on the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the presentation of gifts from the host group, it is now the guests&rsquo; turn to dance. This is in a tadok style distinctly different from the tadok of the hosts. The Sumadel Kalinga dance the tadok in the <strong>binowagan</strong> style, which is distinct from that of the Mangali men. The Mangali kick their left foot with their leg straight in front as they hop on the right foot. The Sumadel kick their right foot backward with right knee bent as they hop on the left foot. The Sumadel and the Bontok have this tadok in common. On the other hand, the Mangali and Sumadel women&rsquo;s sangni are identical. Thus, they can dance together or exchange places, whereas the Mangali and Sumadel men must keep to their respective lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second day of the celebration begins with the bodong or galigad ceremony, when speeches are made by the main participants vowing to be faithful to the terms of the peace pact. This is followed by a rehearsed dance by five young women on stage as two men play the balladong and the kullitong. This breaks three Kalinga traditions: First, the dance, now performed for an audience, takes on the nature of a &ldquo;folk dance.&rdquo; Second, it is done on stage, not on a communal space. Third, the two musical instruments accompanying this folk dance are traditionally played for private enjoyment. In this staged performance, the dancers stay in place as they do the dasudas while their arms alternate between the bird-like dopa motions, and the hands-on-hips angawak position. This choreography differs significantly from the women&rsquo;s spontaneous sangni of the previous day, when they moved back and forth in a line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dancing then transfers to the festival grounds, where all take turns participating. The <strong>seledsed</strong> is danced to the accompaniment of the<em>tuppaya</em>, a particular style of gong playing. Six male youths play in the tuppaya style on a<em>pinakid</em>(six-gong set). The tuppaya sound is created with the player&rsquo;s palms slapping and sliding on the gong, which is laid on his lap. The seledsed is a mimetic dance between a man and a woman: the man as a rooster chasing a hen, and the woman as the hen evading the rooster. The dance movements involve a towel that each holds between his or her hands. After dancing for a while, they pass on their towels to another pair, who then replace them. More dancing, singing, and dekot presentations continue until late into the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the third day, three activities conclude the celebration: the reading of the terms of the bodong; the<em>tumangad</em>(ritual wine drinking), and the<em>palpaliwat</em>, which is a contest in oratory.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5200\"><strong>Rosario Cruz-Lucero</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The first two sections were solos for Rufino and Jaynario, both characterized as animals. Rufino was slick and supple as a snake, while Jaynario was frenetic and engaging as a monkey. These solos did not seem to connect to the main section of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/47\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/125\"><strong>Buklog</strong></a></strong></a></em></strong>, nor did it have any apparent association with the<em>buklog</em>ritual, appearing instead to be explorations of movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The third section of Fabella&rsquo;s <strong><em>Buklog</em></strong> was inspired by the Subanon indigenous dance of the same name. Performed during rituals for healing the sick and releasing their dead to heaven, the ritual includes building a structure of tall timber posts which support a bamboo platform, on which the ritual participants dance. The structure has a log pestle at the center below the platform, making sounds as it pounds into the hollowed earth as the ritual dancers bounce on it. This traditional dance has the Subanon holding hands in a circle, with jumping and crisscrossing steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fabella&rsquo;s movements for this modern adaptation of the ritual involved many circular steps and patterns, including quick pirouettes of different leg placements, as well as variations on bouncing and stamping to mimic the Subanon bouncing on their bamboo platform. The buklog is a communal ritual, so Fabella used the whole company to reenact the joyous coming together of the community. Dancers were grouped according to &ldquo;type&rdquo;&mdash;the high jumpers, the turners, the graceful, and brusque dancers; every so often, one soloist would break away from the small trios to punctuate their own section and then moved back into their small unison again. Then, Jaynario and Rufino entered the scene to lead the company in the building of the buklog structure, represented by theater scaffolding. The men brought in the metal pipes and assembled the scaffolding as the women bounced around them and eventually climbed the structure. The work ended with a jubilant unison, with dancers moving both on the floor and on the scaffolding. Rufino was positioned at the very top, assisted by Jaynario.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Buklog</em></strong> was restaged regularly for outreach and regional performances of the company. In <strong><em>Buklog</em></strong>, apparent was Fabella&rsquo;s choreographic process, and his intuitiveness and affinity for the dancers he worked with.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

Dancers: VellaDamian (Carmen), RupertAcu&ntilde;a (Don Jose), Eric V. Cruz (Escamillo), Teresita Carreon (Micaela).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet in five scenes closely follows the opera narrative. Don Jose who leads the civil guards meets the sultry cigarette girl, Carmen, but soon takes her in because of a brawl she instigates. He releases her because of the passion she has instigated in him. Meanwhile, Escamillo, the matador, captivates Carmen in a tavern. Carmen reads her ill fate while camping out with gypsies. Here Don Jose turns his back on his childhood sweetheart Micaela, but Carmen rejects him. Escamillo is hailed victorious in a bullring. Carmen is confronted and finally killed by Don Jose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This version created inimitable roles for Damian as Carmen and Acu&ntilde;a as Don Jose, and a most performed ballet from Dance Concert. Since the ballet was acquired by Philippine<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a>Theatre in 1989, it has featured MaiquiMa&ntilde;osa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2543\"><strong>Melanie Motus</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2578\"><strong>Maritoni Rufino</strong></a> as Carmen; NicolasPaca&ntilde;a, Rinat Gizatulin, and OsiasBarroso as Don Jose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Carmen</em></strong> has also been plotted similarly by Rene Dimacali in Bacolod in 1976; jazzed up by AgnesLocsin for the Terpsichorean in Davao in 1977; doubled (i.e. with two Carmens) by EddieElejar for ManilaMetropolisBallet in 1980, to music by Mauricio Ohana. <strong><em>Carmen</em></strong> was also created in flamenco version for RoseBorromeo by RubenNieto (Don Jose), who drew from the Carlos Saura film, at the Light and Sound Theater Lounge, Makati in 1985. Another production was <strong><em>The Many</em></strong><strong><em>Faces of Carmen</em></strong> ( <strong><em>Her Temperaments</em></strong> )by Jane Dungca for St. Anne&rsquo;s Dance and Music Studio, Nueva Ecija, premiered in Manila on 20 May 1988 at the Manila Film Center.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Dancers: EdnaVida / Mercedes Ma&ntilde;ago (Carmen); NonoyFroilan (Don Jose); Butch Esperanza (Prosper Merimee); Romy Roxas (Escamillo); Jinn Ibarrola (Zu&ntilde;iga).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This one-act ballet in five scenes is derived from the original novel by Prosper Merimee, which was also the source of Bizet&rsquo;s opera. In Reyes&rsquo;s version, the events are seen through the eyes of Don Jose who relates to Merimee the series of events which led to his imprisonment and execution. Don Jose is an army corporal, a simple and naive country lad aspiring for a better life. His life is suddenly disturbed when he meets and falls in love with Carmen, a very strong woman who flirts with him. She later leaves him for the bullfighter Escamillo, and in the last scene rejects Don Jose&rsquo;s pleas to be taken back, saying she would rather die than live with a man she no longer loves and respects. Don Jose stabs her in desperation. Back in prison, Don Jose holds the rose Carmen threw at him, and at the end of his story gives it to Merimee before walking away to his execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Carmen</em></strong> fell into the hands of Reyes by pure accident. Originally meant for a guest choreographer, the arrangements did not pull through, and without a choreographer a few months before the scheduled performances, Reyes decided to choreograph the ballet herself. The pressure propelled Reyes to tell the story from the viewpoint of the other victim, Don Jose. The perspective rewarded a unique sentiment for the character who, in most versions, is relegated to the shadows of the story&rsquo;s more colorful and dramatic lead, Carmen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Carmen</em></strong> is the second full-length ballet of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a> after <strong><em>Rama,</em></strong><strong><em>Hari</em></strong> (Rama, King), presented through the CCP Outreach Division&rsquo;s national touring program in 1987. It was repeated in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1988, and in Hong Kong in 1990.

The poems, which date back to the 13th century, were written by the wandering students of England, France, and Germany. Known as the Goliards, the students were better known for drinking, gambling, and rioting than scholarship. For his oratorio, Orff chose 24 poems out of the almost 200 published in 1847 by Johann Andreas Schmeller under the title <strong><em>Carmina Burana</em></strong>.The poems express the frustrations and joys inherent in man&rsquo;s encounter with nature, and in the delights of drinking and love.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Keeping close to the temperament of the songs and text, Reyes&rsquo;s dances are exuberant, erotic, and pagan, and build up to a spiritual climax that asserts life&rsquo;s joys. The dances express the sacred and the profane, the earthy and the sublime. Vividly enhanced by Bernal&rsquo;s design, the curtain rises on a stage laden with rocks embodying the earth, which are later transformed into medieval stained glass representing the divine. The ballet is considered by many to be one of Reyes&rsquo;s most accomplished works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Carmina Burana</em></strong> was featured in a special concert of the ManilaSymphonyOrchestra and the CCPPhilharmonicOrchestra in Oct 1984 with Helen Quach conducting. It was also presented at the Simon Bolivar Festival in Venezuela during its Bicentennial Celebration in 1983, garnering rave reviews from Venezuelan critics.<em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span></em><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

It was created for PBT in 1994 by Spanish choreographer David Campos Cantero. A bookcase surrounds the stage and in between the gigantic leather-bound books are spaces from which dancers enter and exit. On top of the bookcase is a narrow platform on which some of the dances are performed.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the ballet is arranged in intricate patterns. The dancing that moves through these patterns is generally comprised of simple balletic movements but at crucial times becomes intricate. The movements are sweeping and voluptuous, at times quirky and playful, always matching the demands of the dramatic music. The breathless flow of the movements, which is often interrupted by abrupt breaks following Orff&rsquo;scomplex time signatures, presents an interesting atypical balletic action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Campos does not use the entire <strong><em>Carmina Burana</em></strong> score with a 28-song cycle. He selects only 15 songs with each song less than three minutes each. The music of &ldquo;O Fortuna&rdquo; (O Fortune), which begins the ballet, is familiar to most audiences. The dancers are in hooded capes and faceless plaster masks. They jump on and move around square, red stools, creating patterns onstage with these stools and with each other. They also look directly at the audience several times, jutting their blank masks forward to create a chilling effect. These characters appear again in the middle of the ballet. At the end, a reprise of &ldquo;O Fortuna,&rdquo; they appear on top of the bookshelf, lording over penitents. Following &ldquo;O Fortuna&rdquo; is &ldquo;Fortune Plango Vulnera&rdquo;(I Lament the Wounds That Fortune Deals), a bravura <strong>pas de six</strong> (dance for six performers) with elaborate lifting and partnering to contrapuntal rhythms. Next is a somber trio to &ldquo;Veris Leta Facies&rdquo;(The Joyous Face of Spring)where two female waifs subtly attempt to seduce a praying young man. The trio ends with the man returning to his prayer. The next song, &ldquo;Reie&rdquo;(Round Dance), begins as young women carrying candles and walking on top of the bookcase enter from both sides of the stage, as in a procession. They perform a lilting dance andthe lights from the candles sway with them until they exit in a communal breath, rising in unison to an arabesque before running out. They enter again without candles and dance playfully to the &ldquo;Tanz of Uf Dem Anger&rdquo;(Dance in the Meadow). The male ensemble enters leaping to &ldquo;Were Diu Werlt Alle Min&rdquo; (If the Whole World Were Mine), and are joined again by the ladies, whom they lift over their heads in exultation. The celebration is interrupted by the penitence of a knight to &ldquo;Olim Lacus Colueram&rdquo;(Once I Swam in Lakes). He is tormented by Death, represented by a woman in chain mail and knightly armor, taunting him with a large sword. The knight tries to kill Death, but she persists, reminds him of his destiny, and then leaves him. He performs a solo to &ldquo;Ego Sum Abbas&rdquo;(I Am the Abbot). When he exits, the earlier masked figures peek into the library, then rush in and out of the bookcases to dance to &ldquo;In Taberna Quando Sumus&rdquo;(When We Are in the Tavern). After they make their way out between the large books, they return without their masks and capes. They now portray a new set of eight female dancers to perform &ldquo;Veni, Veni, Venias&rdquo;(Come, Come, Pray Come). Four male dancers join them to comprise four sets of pas de trois. As one girl in each set rushes offstage, every man lifts his remaining partner over his head and runs out, except the last couple. The remaining man gently sets his partner down to remove her gown. With this, &ldquo;In Trutina&rdquo;(On the Scales)begins. The woman appears to be naked. A second couple enters to join the first, repeating their confusingly sensual yet sublime pas de deux. This dance juxtaposes the sacred and the profane that Orff contrasts. &ldquo;Tempus est Iocondum&rdquo; (Time to Jest) is another playful romp between flirting couples, giving way to &ldquo;Dulcissime&rdquo; (Sweetest Boy), where the Angel of Death stands above the bookshelf, claiming a virgin. As he takes her to the afterworld, penitents enter in black cloaks to &ldquo;Ave Formosissima&rdquo;(Hail to the Most Lovely). Later, they throw off their cloaks to reveal the sacks underneath as &ldquo;O Fortuna&rdquo; (O Fortune) is reprised. When the music crescendos, the dance builds up to a climax as the curtain falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Carmina Burana</em></strong> was restaged in 1997 and 2003, twice in 2004, with special performances in Meralco Theater in 2006 and 2010.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

In subsequent performances: Set design, SalvadorBernal; lighting design, MoninoDuque, KatschS.J.Catoy, and Alex de Guzman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This modern ballet shows the company at work, at leisure, and in performance, beginning with dancers warming up, the stage crew and anybody else who wishes to join the act milling about, against the background of a bare stage with equipment scattered about, and the overhead lights down. As the dancers execute individual and then group movements, everything gradually clears, the movements slowly coalesce and develop into a formal performance on stage. The &ldquo;fun piece&rdquo; ends with the dancers vying for prominent positions during the curtain call.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Company</em></strong> was premiered at the First Dance Workshop Scholarship Gala Concert. Its unorthodox beginning caused a stir, prompting some in the audience to leave the theater thinking that they had come to a dress rehearsal. The ones who stayed sat bewildered in their seats, losing their discomfort as the ballet slowly progressed into a more conventional &ldquo;performance look,&rdquo; at the end of which they applauded in relief. <strong><em>Company</em></strong> has since been included in touring programs that consist mostly of serious works, as an icebreaker and eye-opener, enjoying rave reviews from critics and delighted reactions from audiences worldwide. It has been performed in the United States, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Great Britain, Greece, Australia, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Hong Kong as well as various cities and provinces in the Philippines.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a></em></strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n"

The ballet was based on translations of the novel by Ma. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> Lacson-Locsin and Leon Ma. Guerreo. The work somatically rendered Philippine history and nationalism, with the visceral qualities distinct through the language of movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet&rsquo;s plot follows the novel&rsquo;s story line but focuses mainly on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/132\"><strong>Crisostomo Ibarra</strong></a>&rsquo;s interactions with the characters, with the addition of imagined scenes. In the opening scene aptly titled &ldquo;Alon&rdquo; (Waves), Ibarra&rsquo;s father appears as a ghost; this is an imagined scene set before the narrative begins. In &ldquo;Kwadro&rdquo; (Frame), Ibarra experiences being snubbed by the affluent during a party in Capitan Tiyago&rsquo;s house. In &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1504\"><strong>Salam</strong></a>in&rdquo; (Mirror), Ibarra discovers the true circumstances of his father&rsquo;s death and the manner of his father&rsquo;s burial, both the handiwork of of Padre Damaso. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s character is introduced in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a>&rdquo; (Song) when the<em>guardia civil</em>(constable) accost and force her to reveal the whereabouts of her children. After, Ibarra and Maria Clara have the chance to meet and confirm their love for each other, exchanging symbols of their commitment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In &ldquo;Laro&rdquo; (Game), the novel&rsquo;s main plot and conflicts play out as Ibarra receives news that his project to build a school was approved. Elias appears and warns Ibarra about a plot to kill him. In this section, Sisa then begins her descent into insanity, Padre Salvi shows his lustful desires for Maria Clara, and Damaso&rsquo;s corrupt ways are exposed. The scene ends with Ibarra threatening Damaso with a knife. In &ldquo;Palabas&rdquo; (Show), Ibarra is excommunicated by the church, amid the annual town festivities. Part of the festivities is the presentation of a show, a balletic respite with the Princesa&rsquo;s technical exhibitions. Later, Salvi extracts a sample evidence of Ibarra&rsquo;s handwriting to seal his doom in exchange for information on the identity of Maria Clara&rsquo;s real father. Then events and truths unfold in a dance that mimics the chess game, which in the novel is played by Ibarra and Don Filipo. After all these events, Ibarra and Maria Clara get together again in the pas de deux, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/895\"><strong>Halik</strong></a>&rdquo; (The Kiss). Finally, in<em>&ldquo;</em>Agos&rdquo; (Current), Elias and Sisa succumb to death, and Ibarra symbolically becomes Simoun in another imagined scene on a boat. To condense the 64-chapter novel into eight contemporary ballet scenes was a feat in itself. The predominant feel of the dance was contemplative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, BP toured <strong><em>Crisostomo Ibarra</em></strong> in Singapore where it received a standing ovation, and in Vigan through a commission by the Office of the Government of Ilocos. That same year, BP 2 also performed the ballet in local schools and universities in Tuguegarao, Manila, Bacolod, Dumaguete, Bukidnon, and Cagayan de Oro. In 2012, it had its second run at the CCP Little Theater to celebrate Rizal&rsquo;s Sesquicentennial. &ldquo;Halik,&rdquo; the pas de deux, was part of the company&rsquo;s repertoire when it toured the United States in 2014 and when it joined the 2015 Asia Pacific Dance Festival held at the University of Hawaii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Crisostomo Ibarra</em></strong> won the Outstanding Dance Production award at the 2010 Gawad Buhay Awards, as well as awards for Cordero, Carissa Adea, and Gabriel.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Regina Angelica Bautista</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The ballet starts starkly yet quietly with severely stooped figures dragging themselves on and off open platforms at various heights. The dancers seem to be led by a central leader or a suffering madonna. They all pound the ground with increasing speed and intensity. Then the monster, resembling both a blazing sun and a dragon, rises from the orchestra audience section and draws all forces and attention to herself. A black cloud of cloth blankets the people on stage. Then walk-on people from the streets get mobbed, liquidated, drowned, and devoured by the large, swirling vortex of darkness that the cloth has become. Eventually, the dancers under the black cloth create a murky maelstrom that envelopes the punching, kicking monster. They carry off the struggling monster into the wings. The eclipse ends, and placidity returns.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

It was performed in the cities of Manila, Makati, Las Pi&ntilde;as, Marikina, Pasay, and Quezon City, and in the provinces of Bulacan and Nueva Ecija. In Oct 2008, it was performed at the 10th Asian Art Festival, in two cities in China. In May 2009, it toured the Visayas, particularly Cebu, Iloilo, Dumaguete, Victorias, Antique, and Roxas, then was staged at the CCP again on 10-12 Jul 2009. The <strong><em>Darangen</em></strong>, or Maranao epic song, was declared in 2005 as one of the world&rsquo;s masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritages of Humanity by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Composed of 17 cycles, the verses are chanted by Maranao elders, telling the history of the Maranao people, with the Prince Bantugen as a heroic ideal. The ballet is based on stories inspired by the epic, written by Sanchez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\"><strong>E. Arsenio Manuel</strong></a>. Lucas&rsquo;s music uses indigenous wind and percussion instruments and prerecorded epic chants, featuring the musicians of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2555\"><strong>Philippine Baranggay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Troupe</strong></a>. In restagings of the ballet, live percussion and chanting are performed along with the recorded music. Bernal&rsquo;s grand designs for the ballet reflect the rich traditions of Maranao tapestry and culture, hinting at a royal opulence. The costumes maintained the traditional Maranao silhouettes of dress without constricting the dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet opens with the arrival of Prinsesa Magimar at the Kingdom of Bumbaran, where she is to wed Datu Madali. However, she is attracted to the king&rsquo;s younger brother, Bantugen. When Magali discovers the flirtation, he banishes Bantugen from the kingdom. A vision of another princess in a faraway land comes to the desolate prince, who then decides to make the journey to find her. As he travels alone, he encounters and overcomes vicious elemental forces: fire, earth, wind, and water. Although he survives these elements, the battles take a toll on his body and he calls for the help of a<em>diwata</em>(guardian spirit), his spirit protector. With the help of the other diwata, Bantugen is transported to the Kingdom between the Two Seas, home of Prinsesa Datimbang, the princess in Bantugen&rsquo;s vision. While a healer tries to resuscitate the prince, the Angel of Death arrives and captures Bantugen&rsquo;s soul. His pet bird then arrives, looking for her master, and finding him, requests Datimbang to bring his body back to Bumbaran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 opens with the arrival of Bantugen&rsquo;s body at Bumbaran. Members of the court are stricken with grief, prompting Datu Madali to forgive his late brother. The warriors Magali and Mabaning, Bantugen&rsquo;s closest friends, ask permission to seek Bantugen&rsquo;s soul in the Skyworld, to which they are led by the bird. The Angel of Death holds court over all the souls he has collected, but he is still lonely. Mabaning dresses up as a woman to entice the Angel of Death, and demands flowers for which the Angel leaves his court to pick some on earth. In his absence, the friends and the bird successfully free Bantugen&rsquo;s soul from the Skyworld. Back at Bumbaran, the kingdom is under attack from Datu Miskoyaw who had decided that Bumbaran would be easy to conquer after Bantugen&rsquo;s death. At the height of the battle, Bantugen&rsquo;s soul is restored and he triumphantly defends the kingdom. The ballet ends with Bantugen&rsquo;s wedding to Datimbang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Darangen ni Bantugen</em></strong> is not structured as a typical classical ballet with <strong>divertissements</strong> and grandpas de deux, although the ballerinas perform onpointes, and the choreography has its foundations in ballet, stylized with Maranao folk dance gestures and flexions. The choreography also uses a lot of bamboo poles, alluding to the <strong>singkil</strong> but without clashing the poles together. Instead, they are used to carry Magimar onto the stage, similar to how the singkil princess enters in later versions of the folk dance, and also to form the Earth elemental monster that attacks Bantugen in Act 1. In place of divertissements, there are several segments that feature corps de ballet work: the dance of the maidens and warriors to back up Magimar&rsquo;s flirtation with Bantugen, the dance of the diwata who dote on the injured prince, and the dance of the souls in the Skyworld. There are virtuosic solos for Bantugen and the Bird, while Bantugen performs a romantic pas de deux, each with Magimar and Datimbang. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the highlights of the ballet is Mabaning&rsquo;s seduction dance for the Angel of Death, executed by Peter San Juan, skillfully disguised in a<em>malong</em>(tubular cloth or garment).<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

In Act 1, Chris Millado&rsquo;s libretto establishes the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/958\"><strong>Narda</strong></a>-Tina animosity from their childhood, as well as the realization of their destinies to become Darna and Valentina, respectively. Darna&rsquo;s power is a legacy handed down through generations among the women in Narda&rsquo;s family. Her lola passes down the magic stone to her and she turns into the crime-fighting superhero known for the legendary cry, &ldquo;Ding!<em>Ang bato!</em>&rdquo; (Ding, the stone!). After Darna saves her town from volcanic destruction, she becomes a beloved figure and attains celebrity status that even politicians want photo opportunities with her. Valentina&rsquo;s hair of snakes is also an enchantment, but one that the young Tina called upon herself. Valentina sings songs of loneliness and wrath and Darna becomes popular and moves to the city to pursue her career of saving the day. Act 1 ends with Valentina kidnapping Narda&rsquo;s romantic interest, Arman.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Act 2, Valentina enchants Arman to make him dependent on her so he backs away when Darna tries to save him. She reveals herself as Narda, to show &ldquo;Ang Tunay na Ako&rdquo; (My True Self), but Valentina takes advantage of this and steals the stone, swallows it, but turns into a<em>mananangga</em>l, a segmenting ghoul whose upper body can fly. Valentina then becomes a parody of Darna, and is called Darna Kuno<em>.</em>Valentina then puts a spell on the entire town, placing the people under her power, and leading them into a portal of hell. Powerless, Narda is also affected, but her brother Ding tries to snap her out of the spell. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> returns to teach Narda that she does not need the magic stone to be powerful because she must find the power within herself. Thus, Narda turns into Darna without the stone, and engages in a flying fight scene with Valentina. The latter takes the form of a serpent, but is still defeated by Darna, who also vanquishes Valentina&rsquo;s army of snake men. The town declares a Darna day, and all celebrate in a techno-infused finale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The production was successful in placing BP on the popular culture map but the dancing took a back seat in favor of the multimedia elements of the production. Technical problems prevented better choreography for the heroine, although her flying prowess was still a sight to behold. Christine Crame, who played Darna, became a familiar face to many Filipinos because of her repeated media exposure. Her face would be Darna to many people, until Angel Locsin played the role in a telenovela only a year later, in 2004. <em><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

The story is about Suwana, a woman about to give birth, who lives in a Bagobo town where people are suffering the ravages of war. The people believe that her child will save the enchanted land from the dark spell that is to be sown by the evil bird Minokawa. Foreseeing the end of his mystic powers over the people, Mao, the<em>babaylan</em>(shaman), is overcome with jealousy. He invokes the spirit of Minokawa to conjure a bloody plan to kill the unborn children of the tribe. Through deception, Mao coerces the people to offer a mass sacrifice in preparation for the coming darkness or eclipse. Suwana escapes from the mass abortion and flees to the dark forest, coming into the care of the old Diwata. She is given a burning stone, a chain of bells, and a flock of birds to help fight the evil bird. In the final scene, the pregnant Suwana confronts Minokawa. She undergoes labor in the midst of the battle but the people protect her from the evil monster. The baby is born and Minokawa is vanquished. The sun reappears and the whole town celebrates.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Diablos</em></strong> as originally envisioned by Santos is a symbolic drama of rituals that are still a central element among most of Asia&rsquo;s folk and traditional theater forms. Reyes integrated these Asian elements with her style of Western improvisational dance. Reconceptualizing her spatial designs of circles, diagonals, and angles to suit the unconventional structure of the open-air T-shaped stage in the ruins of an old Spanish fort, and working closely with artists who were limited in dance technique but brimming with creative energy, she evolved methods of using props, like bamboos, in ways that were innovative and visually stimulating. The PETA pool of musicians expanded and adopted their musical language to the styles and concepts of the choreographer. For Suwana&rsquo;s crusade, they used melodies drawn from the musical cultures of Mindanao; for Minokawa&rsquo;s nuclear aggression, they explored inorganic sounds and electronic synthesizers.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a></em></strong> </p>\r\n"

In the lowlands, the converted Christians or Taongbayan worship an icon of the Virgin Mary, led by three<em>frailes</em>(friars) who move in studied and gnarled piety. The people seem repressed to truly express their feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, an<em>indio</em>(Christianized native)called Estranjero, rebelling against the oppression of the people, steals the jewelled icon and brings it to the mountains. Angered, the priests send out the<em>guardias civiles</em>(constables) in pursuit. The guards run after him like acrobatic monkeys. Estranjero is wounded, but is saved by the Encantada who descends from a mountain, and by the Kababaihan. Led by the Babaylan, they heal and baptize him. They all dance a celebration, as though purifying him and fructifying nature. Estranjero sings about the power of the<em>diwata</em>(guardian spirit)in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1126\"><strong>Biyaya ng Lupa</strong></a>&rdquo; (Earth&rsquo;s Blessings). The holy image is stripped naked, now pristine looking like the Encantada, and is passed around with reverence, in jubilation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Act 2, the priests send out the guards on a headhunt. Many heads roll or fly about. Estranjero himself is shot. Encantada grieves as the women gird for vengeance. A fight ensues where they are raped by the guards, symbolic of and paralleled by the rape of nature, which is personified by Kalikasan. The forest and pagan altars are burned as the priests reclaim the holy image. Overwhelmed, Encantada sheds tears enacted by the Babaylan, Kababaihan, and Kalikasan with their storm-tossed and wavelike bodies. This flood cleanses the mountains but devastates the lowlands and the cathedral. The waves bring back the holy icon to the Encantada, as though an image of herself is restored. Another ritual brings men and women together in joyful exultation and social harmony, implying the restoration of nature&rsquo;s balance and the spirits&rsquo; appeasement.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Premiered by DanceTheaterPhilippines on the occasion of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>&rsquo;s 50th death anniversary on 15 Dec 1984 at Puerta Real, Intramuros, Manila. Dancers: Regina Debuque and Jonathan Terry (Central couple); Susan Atizado and Roberto Clemente, Rose Miranda and Eugene de los Santos (Other Couples).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lines from the American poet Emily Dickinson helped generate the ballet: &ldquo;Exultation floods me. I cannot find my channel / the creek turns sea at thought of thee.&rdquo; The dance structure evolved from the way relationships among six dancers could be changed and interchanged in love-like partnerings, gestures, and movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>In silence and to their own time, three women and three men walk forward and backward to the front. As they complete a line, the music wells up and they link and unlink among themselves. They make similar movements, but in ever changing relations and directions. With the music&rsquo;s rise and fall, they indicate their separate or joint feelings. The three women are left alone to dance out their fears and longings, moving and gesturing together with slight variations. As in a trance, two of the men walk in and steal away two of the women, leaving the third and central woman alone. Soon she is joined by the central man who reaches out for her as she does for him. There are reservations, even resistance, until they quietly walk off together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two earlier couples return and link up in changing pairings. But the two men leave. The two abandoned women dance together. They are joined by the central man who dances with each of them in turn, and all three go off none too happily together. As they leave, the two men return with the central woman. She throws herself at each of them, until one of them drags her away. The man drops to the ground. In a line, the three women now glide in together, as the three men congenially circle behind them. They pair up, reach out, even cry, for each other. As the music wells up again to a dramatic coda, they mark stark partnerings. Along a multilevel diagonal line, they fix their indefinite relationships as the darkening lights catch them in silhouettes.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

However, in 1993, the company presented a full-length Filipino ballet, showcasing members of the company as popular comic book characters, led by Lisa Macuja as Darna/Narda and Melanie Motus as Narda&rsquo;s former childhood friend and Darna&rsquo;s nemesis, the snake-haired Valentina. Choreographed by Gener Caringal, the ballet featured dazzling set effects like Darna flying across the stage in an invisible harness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first act, which establishes the narrative of the story, has the envious antagonist Valentina chasing Narda, the newly crowned Queen of the Fiesta and heroine, all the way to the sea where she has no choice but to jump in. She is saved and aided by Dyesebel, who guides her to the enchanted octopus, Bangenge, from whom they retrieve the<em>agimat</em>or magic stone that transforms Narda into a superhero. Bangenge is strapped to yards of black cloth representing her tentacles and moves mainly her upper body as she manipulates the black cloth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second act, one of the highlights of the performance, is set underwater with nimble mermaids and mermen led by none other than the most famous mermaid of Philippine folklore, Dyesebel. This section is a divertissement from the story, showcasing the company dancers defying mermaid laws as they execute arabesques underwater. Most of the movements are composed of traveling jumps to simulate the effect of swimming mermaids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third act opens with the villainous Valentina and her coterie of snake men, trying to seduce the unwitting Dario. He is eventually saved by the flying Darna who has a fight scene with Valentina. The ballet culminates in a Santacruzan-style wedding for Narda and Dario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a fun adventure ballet that embodied popular Philippine culture, <strong><em>Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><strong>Komiks</strong></a></em></strong> received extensive media mileage and was well-attended and applauded by audiences. However, it was not quite critically celebrated; there were comments on the unnecessary length of certain sections that resulted in the campiness of the final scene. It was never restaged, perhaps because of the elaborate sets and expensive flying equipment.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

The ritual involves the basic aspects of life: religiosity, birth, pain, freedom, and death. It starts with five women behind a central figure, a woman in the throes of childbirth. As in the dugso, they hold hands and stomp their feet in rhythmic progression. The dance progresses from the ritualistic and staid rhythmic patterns of the feet into more intricate and stylized movements involving the whole body, which conjure varied images of fertility. Towards the end of the dance, the woman joins the other women, her union with divinity affirmed with the ritual of birth and sacrifice.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <strong><em>For The Gods</em></strong>,Reyes depicts Western dance movements as radiant and extensive while those of the Eastern dance are intensive. The contrast between sculptured images sweeping across the floor and the ritualistic beginning that is concentrated in center stage clearly define the influence of both cultures on the choreographer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>For The</em></strong><strong><em>Gods</em></strong> was first presented in Apr 1984 at the Larry Richardson Dance Gallery in New York during a concert titled <strong><em>Neo-Filipino</em></strong>.In Manila, it was featured in <strong><em>Hiyas</em></strong>, a festival of original Filipino works that highlighted the 1985 CCP Annual Philippine Music Festival.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Edna Vida</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Succeeding stagings were performed by Erica Marquez-Jacinto, Nina Sayoc, Frances Canto, Ika Katalbas, and Irene Canto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/145\"><strong>Giri</strong></a></em></strong> takes elements from indigenous Filipino dances and animal movements and combines these with abstract modern dance movements. Inspired by the behavior of roosters and chickens in the farmyard, the work depicts courtship drawn from folk dances that imitate birds. The title itself is taken from the children&rsquo;s folk song, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1008\"><strong>Sitsiritsit</strong></a>,&rdquo; specifically the line, &ldquo;Ang babae sa lansangan, kung gumiri&rsquo;y parang tandang&rdquo; (&ldquo;The lady on the street, she struts like a rooster&rdquo;)</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance opens with a male dancer who struts in circles, flapping his arms and executing steps very similar to those found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a> dance. Meanwhile a female dancer does a <strong>promenade en attitude</strong> at the other downstage corner. In between them are the rest of the female ensemble performing <strong>parallel tortillier</strong> steps in a diagonal line, waving their arms above them with hands flexed. This section contrasts the Filipino male&rsquo;s vigor with the female&rsquo;s demureness. The dance, however, does not depict the female as subordinate to the male. Sections in the dance display the women&rsquo;s physical strength which matches the male&rsquo;s cocky prancing to impress them. The first version of <strong><em>Giri</em></strong> ended with a man lifting a woman overhead to declare his choice. Later, Jacinto felt that women were not meant to be trophies to be won, and thus changed the ending where all of them finished in assertive poses, while the man crumpled, holding his head as if in defeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacinto was acknowledged for showing the difference between male and female in folk movements when the work premiered at the 2004 National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Conference at the Folk Arts Theater. <strong><em>Giri</em></strong> was repeated several times in a short version performed at a Dance Development Conference in Nanning, China, in 2005, and at the 7th DLSU Arts Congress at the De La Salle University in 2014.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

Classical ballet in two acts. Choreography, Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot, revised by Marius Petipa in 1884; scenario, Theophile Gautier and Vernoy de St. George, after Heinrich Heine.

When Giselle discovers Albrecht&rsquo;s true station and engagement to Duchess Bathilde, she dies of a broken heart. Like other maidens who died before their wedding, Giselle is turned into a<em>wili</em>, a female spirit of the glades and vales who lures men to dance to their death. She is initiated as a wili by their queen, Myrtha. The wilis force Giselle&rsquo;s peasant suitor, Hilarion, to dance to his death. They would have done the same to Albrecht but for Giselle&rsquo;s pleas and the timely coming of the dawn when the wilis must disperse or return to their graves. With a heavy heart, Albrecht returns to his society and laments the fate to which he had unwittingly sent the innocent Giselle.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the ballet classics, <strong><em>Giselle</em></strong> has been performed the most in the Philippines.

Choreography, David Lichine; music, Johann Strauss, as arranged by Antal Dorati; costume and set design, Alexandre Benois. Premiered by Col de Basil Original Ballet Russe on 28 Feb 1940 at the Theatre Royal in Sydney, Australia. Dancers: Tatiana Riabouchinska and David Lichine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RicardoandRobertaCassell restaged their own version in Manila in 1955, following the original story. The students of a girl&rsquo;s school in Vienna in the mid-1800s meet cadets from a military academy in celebration of the end of the school year. The headmistress keeps the eager girls in order, and an elderly general does the same for his charges, the cadets. But the young people flirt with each other. The cadets and girls dance, while a boy delivers notes between them. Among the featured dances are those for a drummer boy, a young girl in pigtails, an evocative recollection from <strong><em>La Sylphide</em></strong> (a ballet of the period), a turning competition between two girls, a sequence&mdash;&ldquo;Mathematics and Natural History&rdquo;&mdash;which is no longer done, a mazurkabetween the headmistress and the general, which is cut short by the returning boys and girls, and a final &ldquo;Perpetuum Mobile.&rdquo; All bid goodbye, but a cadet and a girl sneak back into the ballroom for a kiss, are caught, and sent off by the headmistress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TonyFabella made his own version, which was premiered by ManilaMetropolis Ballet on 13 Jun 1986 at the Rizal Theater. He set his own order, while keeping much of the story intact. He added the dance of the headmistress and her pupils, a &ldquo;See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil&rdquo; dance led by a trio, and an open mazurka between the headmistress and the general with the cadets and the girls. Lead dancers were Joey Villadolid, Maricar Hernandez, Sol Fernandez, Violeta Hizon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2549\"><strong>Noreen Ostrea</strong></a>, EddieElejar, and James Lopez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>JulieBorromeo set the work for PhilippineBalletTheatre on 16 Sep 1988 at the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines (CCP), as a tribute to RicardoCassell. The same plot was followed, but without the <strong><em>La Sylphide</em></strong> pas de deux, and with a novel horse trainer or rider. Lead dancers were OsiasBarroso, Veronica Restituto, LisaMacuja, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2409\"><strong>Raoul Banzon</strong></a>, Elejar, and Lopez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reviewing this last version by Borromeo, FelicitasLayag-Radaic said thatGraduationBall was a refreshing, hilarious ballet recalling Ricardo Cassell&rsquo;s own version and described Elejar&rsquo;s headmistress as possessing subtle humor and Osias Barroso&rsquo;s drummer boy performance as a challenging number, rhythmic, fast and precise, with a light and cheery style where he showed his versatility as a dancer. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Set in Berbania, the story begins with a court scene. The three sons of King Fernando are betrothed to three beautiful princesses. But the king falls ill and the three sons&mdash;Pedro, Diego, and Juan&mdash;must look for the cure: the Ibong Adarna&rsquo;s song.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The princes set out on their search. Pedro meets a leper woman, and is unkind to her. He finds the magical tree where the bird roosts, sleeps beneath it, and is turned to stone when the bird sings and sheds a feather on him. Diego also rebuffs the leper and suffers the same fate. Juan, however, shares the last of his bread with the leper, who gives him a potion to overcome the bird&rsquo;s soporific song. Juan finally captures the creature. His brothers, who awaken, connive to kill him and bring the bird home themselves. But the Adarna refuses to sing until Juan, who is thought dead, returns with the leper. In a grand pas de deux, Juan takes the bird, which now sings. The king revives, and Berbania is restored to peace and harmony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This production is significant for its use of folkloric material, and because it is the first major attempt to adapt the famous<em>korido</em>(metrical romance) into dance.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

She describes <strong><em>Igorot</em></strong> as a series of Igorot dances translated as a neoclassical ballet. The modern ballet in one act plays up the characteristic birdlike gestures and earthy footwork of the quintessential Cordillera dances. It sets off key figures, like a prayerful woman prostrate at the start of the ballet, a trio in rivalry over a woman, and a priestly female leader. The music keeps on shifting or doubling with voice (chanting) and instruments (<em>gangsa</em>or gong, flute, and bamboo or wooden percussions). The costuming is stylized, with the women wearing G-strings like the men, and traditional wide blankets or narrow scarves..</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some women trace a winding path around the crouched supplicant, the praying woman gradually stands with accented movements and sharp poses. The other women soon return to join her in a file, their feet puncturing the ground with their pointes to the melody and rhythm of a<em>salidummay</em>(folk song in Cordillera).Their knees and feet are earthbound, but their torsos and arms are upright and almost birdlike&mdash;dancing in unison to gongs but in various directions. They scrape the ground with their feet or leap like birds in flight. To a chant, they kneel, while a female leader dances with arms carried up, flat and bent. They all dance together, the leader weaving in or leading. Left alone, she simply swings an arm and bounces to amplified bamboo sounds and under an overhead light, as though entranced by the gongs and her own movements. She then leaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To powerful gong playing, two men enter, earthbound, yet leaping, crawling, sometimes hopping. The women join them in unison, but go in various directions. Left together, the two men squat, crawl, and jump, their arms in accented flying gestures. A woman enters and one of the men courts her by taking one of her two scarves&mdash;symbols of choice. Their dance is a contest to frenetic gongs and bamboo percussion, sometimes to chanting, which sometimes sound like taunting. At the end they separate. The other man reenters and he seems to be the woman&rsquo;s choice. He takes her remaining scarf. Their dance is more intimate, although it still has the character of a contest. She is lifted a few times, and is finally caught in one of his arms. The other women dance around them, as though approving and celebrating their union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Igorot</em></strong> is startling in its virtuosity, testing the marriage of the ethnic and the balletic. Classical pointework, supposedly to transcend gravity, is used for attack, punctuating the earth, cutting the air. Arms, rhythm, and energy are as native as the terraces, but virtuosity is pure balletic technique. At midpoint, the tone somehow shifts to modern style, the balletic mode recaptured only in the second pas de deux. A more singular merger could have unified the tone. Nevertheless, choreographic invention and tension are sustained to the end.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Dancers: Dwight Rodrigazo (Pepe), Sharon Brendia (Maria), Paul Morales, Christine Maranan Novales, Lynley Tan, Avel Bautista, Nordic Caraig, Reagan Cornelio, Proceso Gelladuga II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/150\"><strong>Indios Bravos</strong></a></em></strong> was presented by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and the British Council. It shows the parallel lives of national hero Jose Rizal, and a<em>bagong bayani</em>(new hero), the overseas Filipino worker (OFW) in the person of Maria, who travels to Europe and endures loneliness and hardship to offer her family a better life. Act 1, &ldquo;Ang Paglayag&rdquo; (Departure), shows Pepe, the humanized figure of Rizal, and Maria sharing the stage as they wake up on the day they leave for Madrid. An ensemble dance depicts travelers either shoving each other in crowds, or restlessly waiting in line at a sea port / airport terminal. They swing around heavy hand-carried luggage. This movement which is the main motif of the dance suggests that traveling outside one&rsquo;s country to give those left behind a better future is a necessary burden.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2, &ldquo;Buhay sa Europa&rdquo;(Life in Europe), shows how the protagonists try to adjust to a European &ldquo;rhythm&rdquo; and climate. A video is projected on the cyclorama during the solo of Maria to magnify her loneliness, dejection, and suffering in the unbearable cold climate. Her solo is abruptly interrupted by a ringing phone, and she answers a call from home. Parallel to this incident, Pepe receives a letter sent by his mother who expresses her anxiety over his ambitious pursuit of a better education far from home. Simultaneously, a &ldquo;live exhibit&rdquo; of indigenous Filipinos in Madrid in 1887 is reenacted, a precursor of the 1904 St. Louis Exposition featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> &ldquo;villages.&rdquo; The dancers start off as mannequins and perform a stylized Igorot dance, symbolizing how Filipinos were seen as cultural objects. This intimates how Pepe and Maria must deal with the same prejudice through their journeys. Pepe travels throughout Europe, as does Maria who escapes from her abusive employer. Act 2 ends when Maria discovers the statue of Rizal in a park in Germany and, by resting at its feet, finds solace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 3, &ldquo;Ang Bayan Ay Nasa Puso&rdquo; (The Moving Homeland), shows Maria and Pepe better adjusted to their European lives in Paris. Pepe and his<em>ilustrado</em>(educated) friends see an American Indian in another live exhibit at a later world exposition. They are inspired to form a loose organization of Indios Bravos, determined to propagate the strength and pride of their countrymen through their writing. This scene is rendered by a powerful ensemble of dancers with canes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movement vocabulary in <strong><em>Indios Bravios</em></strong> is from an experimental technique that Rodrigazo was developing at that time he choreographed the work. He called this &ldquo;pulling technique.&rdquo; Instead of releasing the limbs from the body to create the dance, the movement continues inward, into the core, lengthening the rest of the body as energy is drawn within. To successfully use this technique in <strong><em>Indios Bravos</em></strong>, Airdance company members took a daily syllabus class which Rodrigazo devised. This technique was kept by Rodrigazo after he retired as artistic director of Airdance and eventually used the name for his new company and school, Dance Pull in Bacolod City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The riveting ilustrado dance, featuring the ensemble with canes, is often staged by Airdance in mixed bill repertoire performances, sometimes with a mixed-gender cast. <strong><em>Indios Bravos</em></strong> was restaged for the French Spring in Manila in 2005 at OnStage, Greenbelt 1, Makati City, organized by Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise where Rodrigazo reprised his role of Pepe while Nina Hayuma Habulan did Maria. Excerpts were restaged in 2008 at the <strong><em>WiFi Body Festival</em></strong>, with John Philip Martir as Pepe and Marielle Alonzo as Maria.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

Succeeding stagings: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2543\"><strong>Melanie Motus</strong></a> as Itim Asu at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\"><strong>Carlos P. Romulo</strong></a> Auditorium in RCBC Plaza Makati on 24 Feb 2010; Ava Maureen Villanueva as Itim Asu and Johnny Amar as Bustamante at Dance Forum Space on 4-5 Mar 2011; and Villanueva and Cornelio at the Media Center, UP College of Mass Communications on 15 Feb 2012. Myra Beltran&rsquo;s contemporary dance interpretation of Virginia Moreno&rsquo;s play incorporates dance with drama, text, and multimedia in retelling the assassination of Gov-Gen Bustamante and the creation of Itim Asu as a legend. The play-within-a-play that deals with the Burgos account as an alleged forgery includes Beltran&rsquo;s own deliberations on &ldquo;real&rdquo; events that inform and accompany the work, hence the inclusion of the dates 1719-2009. The dates imply the significance of the Bustamante legend in Philippine history since 1719 and Moreno&rsquo;s belief that history repeats itself, to which Beltran also subscribes. The multilayering of texts in the choreography echoes the ideas in Moreno&rsquo;s play, allowing Beltran to incorporate her reading of history. Each restaging of the work shows the historical present by changing the year in the title, such as <strong><em>Itim Asu: 1719-2011</em></strong> for a 2011 staging in UP College of Mass Communication.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scene 1 presents the UP Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (UPDC) as the Filipino Youth of Today, the storytellers in a dance rendering of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1832\"><strong>A la Juventud Filipina</strong></a>&rdquo; (To the Filipino Youth). The dancers/storytellers lay the ground for the legend of Itim Asu by preparing for a film shoot. This is a contemporary version of Moreno&rsquo;s play-within-a-play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scene 2 shows the shooting of the &ldquo;play&rdquo; within the &ldquo;play,&rdquo; a presentation of the relationship of Bustamante and his wife Maria, and the oppression of the womenfolk by the friars. The scene is constituted by intensely foreboding images of wailing women, scheming men, all hinting at the violence to come. Bustamante&rsquo;s death is not portrayed directly. Rather, it is Maria&rsquo;s grief that allows the audience to assume that he was killed. When Maria transforms into Itim Asu, she dances one last time with her husband&rsquo;s spirit, expressing a widow&rsquo;s grief and acceptance. They are joined onstage by the rest of the company, performing the same duet, effectively multiplying the emotions of the principal couple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scene 3 plays a voice recording of Beltran expressing her interpretation of the previous scenes. Two men dance in an athletic duet, at first mirroring each other and then eventually conversing. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> man is Rizal addressing another<em>ilustrado</em>(educated), who, in Beltran&rsquo;s mind, is Luna. Other interpretations consider the second conversant as Burgos, chronicler of Bustamante&rsquo;s story. The next part of the scene is Beltran&rsquo;s solo to her own reading of Rizal&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\"><strong>Mi Ultimo Adios</strong></a>.&rdquo; Her sharp, powerful movements struggle with an invisible force that she successfully conquers. Toward the end, Itim Asu joins her onstage, imbibing Rizal&rsquo;s strength and resolve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scene 4 is a filming of Paulita&rsquo;s wedding scene from <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></a></em></strong>, a light scene that turns ominous when repeated at different angles for retakes, which Beltran uses to show how history &ldquo;rewinds&rdquo; itself. This scene is taken from Moreno&rsquo;s play, where a character, alluded to as Macario Sakay, portrays Simon Ibarra and Bustamante in the same play. He is a revolutionary disguised as an actor. An American actor in the cast believes that Sakay the actor has planted a real bomb to throw into the audience, in an attempt to assassinate the American dignitaries coming to see the play. He shoots Sakay the actor. In Beltran&rsquo;s staging, the dancer portraying Bustamante takes the place of Sakay in the third take of the filming. He is then shot in a scene that refers to the earlier murder. Moreno&rsquo;s scene depicted the blurring of fiction and reality, in light of Burgos&rsquo;s account of Bustamante&rsquo;s story being declared a forgery. But its myth lives on, inspiring revolutionary ideals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reaction to the shooting, the character of Itim Asu storms in on a murderous rampage, her fury duplicated by the female ensemble; her struggle and quest for justice are multiplied and her mission becomes that of the masses. This is an articulation of Beltran&rsquo;s idea that we are all in &ldquo;the middle of history.&rdquo; The scene where Bustamante is taken away and killed is blocked from sight, in the same way that Benigno Aquino Jr was escorted out to the side of the airplane to his inevitable death.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

Itim Asu&rsquo;s revenge is further carried through by Sandugo, her daughter, and a son-in-law by a subsequent marriage to an<em>indio</em> (Christianized native).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<div></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Fernando Manuel de Bustamante y Bustillo began his tenure as governor-general of the Philippines on 9 Aug 1717. His discovery and investigation of anomalies and corruption in the Public Treasury and the Galleon Trade set him at odds with the religious orders and influential persons in Manila. In 1719, after several personages had been jailed on his orders, a procession of friars and religious escalated into a mob, and Bustamante was assassinated in the Residencia in Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three ritual scenes from the play are the literary source for the ballet. &ldquo;The Assassination,&rdquo; where the Indio Juan and Angelito Soliman are terrified onlookers to the murder of Gov-Gen Bustamante; &ldquo;The Transfiguration,&rdquo; where the vengeful wife seeks refuge in the hut of Indio Juan and transfigures herself into Itim Asu, who vows perpetual revenge on the assassins, performing a ritual dance as she holds the Aztec lamp that lighted up the death of Bustamante; &ldquo;The Revenge,&rdquo; where ItimAsu, attended by Indio Juan, pretends to need a confession and goes from convent to convent to reenact her ritual killing, each announced by a frantic ringing of the<em>campanilla</em>. Her victims are ushered out from the confessional box which, when carried out by the townspeople, looks like a coffin. She is pierced by a mysterious bullet in the midst of her vendetta but rises in her death pangs like a woman, not a beast. She blesses the blood marriage of her daughter to the son of Indio Juan as Sandugo. The two later carry out her primitive justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Itim Asu</em></strong> was presented by the CCP in association with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4039\"><strong>League of Filipino Composers</strong></a> as its second offering in the 1970 PhilippineMusic and Dance Festival.

Regular in the early repertoire of BalletPhilippines, the ballet was last repeated by the ManilaMetropolisBallet at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/792\"><strong>Rigodon</strong></a> Ballroom of the Manila Peninsula in 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one-act ballet retells the story of Italy&rsquo;s most famous lovers. Juliet is already presumed dead in a crypt, and Romeo rushes back to Verona. Both characters reenact the story in a stiff and somber flashback. Leading characters were totally in grey as distinguished from the corps de ballet in total black. The corps generally functions as a chorus but members occasionally take on specific characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a few strokes, Elejar captures the quintessence of Shakespeare&rsquo;s universal story, reminding one of Michelangelo Antonioni&rsquo;s love scene in <strong><em>Zabriskie</em></strong><strong><em>Point</em></strong>. The use of grey and black for the dancers, other characters, and the sets, is clever. These characters produce a hazy background which highlights the pearly richness and perfect innocence of JulietandherRomeo, their love and inevitable death. <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/153\"><strong>Juliet and Her Romeo</strong></a></em></strong> is one of Elejar&rsquo;s best ballets, and one of the best produced in the country.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Indarapatra sends Sulayman to subdue these monsters with the enchanted kris, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/154\"><strong>Juru-Pakal</strong></a>; Sulayman&rsquo;s life is symbolized by a magical tree which flourishes or withers. Sulayman conquers all except Pah, who kills him. Indarapatra searches for his brother&rsquo;s body, finds it, and prays to the gods to bring him back to life. Indarapatra himself goes on to subdue the mighty Balbal, is hailed by the populace, and marries the sultan&rsquo;s daughter. They have a daughter, Rinayung, and a son, Rinamuntaw. Later, Indarapatra bestows his magical kris on his son. The last part of the epic finds Rinamuntaw on a hunt. He spies the Moon Goddess and her maidens, and catches the goddess&rsquo;s pet, the Sarimanok. In exchange for her liberty, the heavenly bird flies Rinamuntaw to the skies where he has a celestial wedding with the goddess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet was described as belonging to the tradition of Asian theater, with elements of Kabuki drama, as well as dance movements from Thailand, Indonesia, and Cambodia. Although the dance utilizes the Mindanao epic, the choreographer went beyond territorial boundaries to present what he felt was dance in the Asian tradition.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Premiered by Dance Pull Company at the 2008 <strong><em>WiFi</em></strong><strong><em>Body Festival</em></strong> at the Tanghalang Huseng Batute, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rodrigazo returned to his hometown of Bacolod in 2006 with a plan to distinctly establish a school, company, and ultimately a dance community away from Manila. In his school, he developed his choreographic style, based on what he calls &ldquo;directional motivation,&rdquo; or moving in the opposite direction of what is considered &ldquo;natural.&rdquo; This is basically a rebellion against the standard movement of classical ballet and modern dance, resulting in &ldquo;dance and pull,&rdquo; which is also the name of his dance company and school. The technique was first explored in his <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/150\"><strong>Indios Bravos</strong></a></em></strong> (Brave Natives) and further developed in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/156\"><strong>Karga Tapas</strong></a></em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Karga Tapas</em></strong> was inspired by the migrant<em>sakada</em>or seasonal plantation workers who toil in the sugarcane haciendas of Negros cutting (<em>tapas</em>) and loading (<em>karga</em>) sugarcane into trucks for a miserable daily wage. These tasks are transformed by choreographer Dwight Rodrigazo into a repetitive, almost ritualistic movement executed with variant gestures. In the dance, the sakada wear burnt sienna red masks underneath layers of rough clothing which protect them from the heat of the sun. They carry scythes for cutting the sugar canes. Rhythm is provided by a hand-held drum and stomping of feet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the beginning until the end of the choreography, dancers spring like rubber bands stretched to full length from positions close to the floor, sometimes jumping away only to be pulled back close to the ground. At the same time, the dancers slash their surroundings with their scythes. During intervals, the dynamics of the stomping and slashing magnify and relax, mimicking the rising and falling levels of energy of the sakada out in the field. Two female dancers stand taller than the male dancers and do not stomp as hard. Rodrigazo abruptly breaks the momentum of cutting and carrying by gathering the sakada to one corner of the stage to watch an imagined delivery truck drive away with their day&rsquo;s harvest. Then, the sakadaresume their toiling movements, their stomping, and their inescapable lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The premiere performance struck many members of the audience as an eye-opening portrayal of Filipino life. Some viewers criticized the work for presenting a harsh statement on local labor conditions while others praised it for its empathy with the working class.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

Act 1 revolves around the headhunting of the Kalinga, and a courtship-into-wedding scene. Called the peacocks of the mountains, the Kalinga men are decked out in plumed headdresses. Everyone listens for the sound and flight of the ominous<em>idaw</em>bird&mdash;telling of victory or defeat in a kayaw. The<em>mangayaw</em>enacts the swift attack to decapitate the enemies and to gain honor in one&rsquo;s own tribe, especially for those who aspire for leadership and the title<em>pangat</em>.<em></em>In the clash of spears and shields, two of their own are left dead, one headless. Lamentation of the women and children pierce the silence, as though to bestir the dead to avenge themselves. A<em>mandadawak</em>(priestess) does the same with a ceremonial china bowl into which she seems to catch hair from the air, believed to be of their ancestors. Hair is planted on the heads of grieving relatives. Donning red which is the color for mourning, the women light a fire, as though to burn away the spirits of the dead so they will not bother the living. To the victorious warriors called<em>minger</em>,the maidens give the<em>dangas</em>(headbaskets) while singing the<em>balugay</em>.<em></em>The warriors themselves are absolved of their bloody act by eating<em>binurbur</em>(rice), and are anointed by the mandadawak with the blood of a black rooster. In the<em>ulawi</em>, the mingers do the victory dance called <strong>takiling</strong> where they are crowned with<em>lawi</em>(feathered headdresses) reserved only for successful headhunters.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A warrior chooses a girl, bestowing her a gift as he dances the <strong>la-ay</strong>.<em>Ngilin</em>is the wedding proper where the bride accepts firewood as proof of matrimonial agreement. Musicians play the<em>tuppay</em>a beat on the gongs for the wedding, to which the groom dances like a rooster in a love-play with his bride who balances pots of oil on her head, symbol of a smooth married life. In the <strong>tuktukyod</strong>,they enact a contest on who is to bathe after the wedding. The rest of the maidens balance pots on their heads as they skip and sing on their way to a waterfall, dancing the<em>banga</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 enacts the<em>bodong</em>where the tribes forge a peace pact; otherwise a kayaw could be renewed. To the solitary tune of a nose flute, later joined by mouth lutes, gongs, guitars, violins and voices, a pangat leads a conference among various tribal chieftains. <strong>Pakupak</strong> is invocation for the meeting of elders. <strong>Palpaliwat</strong> boasts of the triumphant exploits of warriors. <strong>Tarektek</strong> imitates the woodpecker in a dance whose participants are armed with a gong and a blanket. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/42\"><strong>Bendiyan</strong></a></strong> is an Ibaloy victory dance with the hands and feet directed downwards to the earth. An Isneg duet depicts the character of the most bashful of the northern tribes. <strong>Chun-no</strong> of the industrious Bontok is a rice-pounding dance, done while singing. <strong>Ulok</strong> displays the treasured blankets of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>. <strong>Tajuk</strong> is another festival dance of the Kalinga, showing off their finery. With the celebration, the bodong is consummated.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The UPCC sings Felipe de Leon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ako Ay Filipino&rdquo; (I Am Filipino) as a prelude to the suite. PBT joins them only on the second song, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/992\"><strong>Sa Kabukiran</strong></a>&rdquo; (In the Countryside) medley, an ensemble piece for the ladies, highlighting Fabella&rsquo;s love for contrapuntal ensemble work, where the dancers make pretty patterns around each other. &ldquo;Sa Kabukiran&rdquo; is abstract and focuses on the dancing, particularly the juxtaposition of elaborate pointe work with the graceful sweeping of arms and upper bodies, further enhanced by the dancers&rsquo; flowing dresses, with sleeves cut to resemble the<em>kimona</em>, a traditional female garment.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is followed by a pas de quatre to &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/904\"><strong>Hindi Kita Malimot</strong></a>&rdquo; (I Cannot Forget You), featuring two couples falling in love: the first, sweet and poignant; the second, giddy and breathless. The steps in these duets are not as elaborate as those in the first piece, as Fabella meant to emphasize the emotions in each gesture more. The tone becomes playful as the ensemble enters, skipping and galloping around to &ldquo;Ay, Ay Pag-Ibig&rdquo;(Oh, Oh, Love). The next kundiman is a pas de trois to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4202\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4203\"><strong>Restie Umali</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Pag-Ibig Mo&rdquo;(Your Love), full of quiet yearning and unrequited love between the three dancers. A happier pas de deux is then performed by Lisa Macuja and Osias Barroso to &ldquo;Tuwing Umuulan at Kapiling Ka&rdquo;(Whenever It Rains and You&rsquo;re With Me), before Maritoni Rufino leads the ensemble in a finale, &ldquo;Dito Nagwawakas&rdquo;(It Ends Here)<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Fabella&rsquo;s previous suite of pop songs, <strong><em>Pinoy Talaga</em></strong> (Truly Pinoy), was popular with audiences because of the familiar music that accompanied the dances, it was criticized for being forgettable and cutesy. In contrast, <strong><em>Kundiman, Noon at Ngayon</em></strong> <em>,</em>while still retaining humorous moments and cute accents, stands out with its elegance and fulsome, gorgeous dancing. A short version of <strong><em>Kundiman</em></strong> was regularly staged from 2001 to 2006. <em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B. Jacinto</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Suspended through most of the ballet, the lamp stands for Rizal&rsquo;s ideals, which helped bring about the revolution. He is hoisted twice towards the overhanging lamp in order to identify his own life with the symbol, and to suggest that he is the moth attracted to and burned by the flame. Its &ldquo;explosion&rdquo; refers to the lamp meant to signal the outbreak of a rebellion in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1162\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></a></em></strong>, the sequel to the <strong><em>NoliMeTangere</em></strong> (Touch Me Not). In the novel, the explosion does not happen; the ballet takes the liberty of suggesting that Rizal foresees his own death in that explosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one-act ballet opens with Rizal lighting a lamp that explodes. After an emotional solo, Rizal is visited by priests asking for his retraction, by several Katipunero (revolutionaries) soliciting his support for the revolution, by his wife Josephine Bracken with whom he dances an intimate pas de deux, and by his mother Do&ntilde;a Teodora and his two sisters. A transition comes when he is fetched by the<em>guardias civiles</em>(constables) for his execution in Bagumbayan, later known as Luneta. His fall leads to his dream of a revolutionary encounter. He wakes up. In another brief episode, he is again visited by his disconsolate wife and weeping family, who later take away the lamp supposed to contain his poem &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\"><strong>Mi Ultimo Adios</strong></a>.&rdquo; He is fetched once more by the guards. The fort setting changes to a projected photograph of Rizal&rsquo;s actual execution. He and his guards mime a walk downstage as the curtain slowly falls.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The story is told from the perspective of Apolinario Mabini, the &ldquo;sublime paralytic&rdquo; of the Philippine Revolution, and focuses on his contentious relationship with Emilio Aguinaldo, the first and only president of the Revolutionary Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The production consists of a prologue and two acts, and utilizes dialogue, movement, and music to create a powerful dance-theater fusion. The prologue sets the tone of the ballet as Mabini rests on a hammock on a roadside en route to Kawit, Cavite, where Aguinaldo is set to proclaim Philippine independence from Spain. Mabini and Aguinaldo disagree on issues related to the declaration of independence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 1 takes the audience back to the 16th century when Filipinos enjoyed freedom. The coming of the Spaniards results in the subjugation of the archipelago as the colonizers inflict cruelty on the Filipinos. Amidst all these, three Filipino figures stand tall in defiance of the Spanish rule during the 19th century&mdash;Andres Bonifacio, Aguinaldo, and Mabini. Inspired by the muses of Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity, Bonifacio forms the Katipunan, a secret society to fight for Philippine independence. Aguinaldo joins the Katipunan while Mabini chooses to remain with the reformists. When the Spaniards discover the Katipunan, the Philippine revolution begins. Aguinaldo is elected president of the revolutionary government and Bonifacio is tried for treason and ordered killed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Act 2, the Americans join forces with the Filipinos in their war with Spain. Aguinaldo leads the fledgling government, orders the sewing of the Philippine flag, proclaims Philippine independence, and convenes the Malolos Congress to ratify the declaration of independence and write a Constitution. Through all these developments, Mabini, who has become an influential adviser to Aguinaldo, cautions him against the Americans and the Malolos Congress led by the<em>ilustrado</em>(educated). After the Spanish-American War, Spain cedes the Philippines to the United States of America which thereafter refuses to recognize the declaration of Philippine independence. Armed conflict with the Americans begins. Aguinaldo becomes disillusioned with the treachery of fellow Filipinos and contemplates on a peaceful settlement with the Americans. He is captured and is forced to pledge allegiance to the American flag. Aguinaldo steps down from power and becomes witness to the continuing division of his countrymen. Mabini bewails their defeat and expresses a deep sentiment that if Filipinos do not change their ways, the country will never reach greatness and will remain an illiterate race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin&rsquo;s close collaboration with librettist Dennis Marasigan, a stage director and actor, inspired her to tell the story in a dance theater style. The casting of theater actor Nonie Buencamino as Aguinaldo allowed the utilization of dialogue interspersed with music to create a more effective retelling of history. The choreography is markedly neo-ethnic in style as is typical of Locsin&rsquo;s other modern dance pieces. She drew inspiration from various forms of traditional and ethnic dances for the ensemble choreography and used percussive, earth-bound, and angular movements, as well as lyrical contemporary dance styles for the dance sequences of the three muses and Mabini&rsquo;s solos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>La Revolucion Filipina</em></strong> was lauded by critics and audiences alike for its compelling narrative, powerful choreography and effective retelling of Philippine history. After its world premiere in Feb 1996, it was performed in Los Angeles and San Diego, California, in Jul 1996 and at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC and Honolulu in 1998. It was restaged by BP as part of its annual CCP season in 1997, 1998, 2008, and 2014. For its 2008 restaging, <strong><em>La Revolucion Filipina</em></strong> garnered three Gawad Buhay awards from Philstage: namely, Outstanding Dance Production, Outstanding Original Choreography for Agnes Locsin, and Outstanding Male Lead Performance in a Dance Production for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2478\"><strong>Biag Gaongen</strong></a>. Its 2014 restaging was presented in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Apolinario Mabini.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Nestor O.

Amilbangsa</strong> </u></a>. Music,<em>kulintangan</em>(gong) ensemble recorded by Amilbangsa or live kulintangan accompaniment. Amilbangsa herself danced the <strong>linggisan</strong> in its numerous performances. Premiered in Aug 1978 during the Pacific People&rsquo;s Theater Festival, San Jose, California, USA; in 1988, at theNational Theater<em></em>in Seoul, Korea, in the International Dance Festivaland the 24thSeoul Olympiad; in 1994, at the11thGeneral Assembly and International Dance Colloque, International Council of Dance and the National Dance Council of Italy in Turin, Italy; in 1995, in theORFF-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> International Conference of Music and Dance, Monash University Auditorium, Melbourne, Australia; and in the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women / NGO Forum on Women in Beijing, China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/163\"><strong>Linggisan</strong></a></em></strong> is an original choreography based on the field research of Amilbangsa. She created a coherent scenario with a beginning, middle, and end that showed a bird in flight, landing on soil or water&rsquo;s surface, looking for food, and enjoying its freedom in the natural environment. This variant of the <strong>pangalay</strong> or <strong>igal</strong> (dance style from Sulu Archipelago) not only has its own character, but also has a distinct melodic pattern in the kulintangan ensemble. Linggisan used a variety of hand and finger movements that were exaggerated through the use of metal claws called<em>janggay</em>,<em>sulakengkeng</em>, or<em>saling-kuku</em>. Amilbangsa first saw this mimetic dance in 1969 at Plaza <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\"><strong>Tulay</strong></a> in Jolo, Sulu when gay dancers converged after supper to perform the <strong>dalling-dalling</strong>, a humorous song-dance, that has a serious segment imitating a bird called &ldquo;linggisan.&rdquo; Amazed by the sophistication and variety of its movements, Amilbangsa continued to document linggisan among Sama and Tausug dancers who use the janggay for the dance. Then she waited for several months for a serendipitous occasion when a good dancer could show new techniques. For instance, in Jolo, the best linggisan movements were demonstrated by a woman who showed exceptionally beautiful dance combinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>She continued her research on linggisan in Tawi-Tawi starting in 1973 by memorizing dance steps performed by students and ordinary people during school celebrations and social gatherings. But learning the movement vocabulary needed a sharp and quick memory so she developed a method of remembering dance steps, stances, and gestures through her own shadow cast on the wall by a lighted candle or lamp. There was no electricity in Tawi-Tawi until 1983 which made the shadow dancing a natural habit for her after field work. From her dancing shadows, she codified the dance by drawing stick figures until she was able to put together and refine poses, stances, gestures, and footwork recorded from numerous dancers. The stick figures were replaced by the pangalay silhouette figures which first appeared in Amilbangsa&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pangalay</em></strong> published in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1994, <strong><em>Linggisan</em></strong> was performed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2488\"><strong>Hwa Yi Ethnic Dance Center</strong></a>&rsquo;s principal dancer Abigail Yu at the Second Seoul International Dance Competition, winning the Silver Award in the solo category. In 1996, it was performed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2604\"><strong>Tambuli Cultural Troupe</strong></a>&rsquo;s principal dancer, Sakinur-ain Mugong, at the XIV International Music Festivalin Cantonigros, Catalunya, Spain, with kulintangan accompaniment by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3919\"><strong>Aga Mayo Butocan</strong></a> and Muhan Julasman. In 2001, Amilbangsa performed it at the Malay World Arts Festival and Conference, Johor Bahru, Malaysia.

The cast also included dancers of FranciscaReyes-Aquino&rsquo;s UPFolkSongandDanceTroupe, the Torres High School, the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, and the Arellano High School.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kane and Tapales worked together on this two-act ballet, selecting scenes from JoseRizal&rsquo;s account of the popular Laguna legend, and producing the first Filipino ballet in the classic tradition. Tapales composed a score inspired by the lush forests and mist-covered peaks of Makiling, and used the<em>musikong bumbong</em>(bamboo-band musicians).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Act 1, the villagers at the foot of Mount Makiling await the legendary vision of Maria Makiling as a sign of a bountiful harvest. The characters include a vendor, the belle, the fool, the barrio captain, the local hero and his companions, and a pair of an old man and woman, a brass and bamboo band, children, other villagers, and the vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Act 2, the mountain goddess meets with the barrio hero in the depths of the forest. Intervening, the people propitiate her with a white chicken, and convince the hero that earthly love is more reasonable than fantasy.MariangMakiling retires to her mountaintop, forever to weep over her unfaithful mortal lover. Her tears form the mists around the peak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work is a landmark piece because it was the first to use a local legend and a composition originally created for ballet. Later choreographers consider this piece as their inspiration as well as the point of departure for their own original ballet choreographies.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Anita M.

Throughout the ballet, Moreno&rsquo;s poem is read, interspersed with the sections of the music. The girl in white unitards tries out her own dexterity with balances and turns, and finally falls, rocks herself, and mirror mimes with her hand. The brother&rsquo;s jumpy solo is to a stanza. Then, brother and sister dance to music with playful movements like clapping and skipping. The father&rsquo;s clenched-fist solo is to another stanza. The playful trio which shows the father catching, lifting the daughter and son is to music. After each relationship is sketched, the girl goes up an appropriate platform with its respective mask. After all these, the girl is left alone. The man in black slides off his ramp as a new stanza is read. He does a sensual, jazzy solo, playing with his stiff hat which he throws at the girl&rsquo;s feet. To silence, he invites her to dance, waltzing, turning, and lifting her.Seduction comes after she is divested of her headcap; they dance and end up lying on the floor on their sides. The brother and father leap over them and the girl sits up, protesting their questioning looks and gestures. Toward the end, even the lover leaps around her together with the brother and father.All the men walk away. Alone, the girl slips to the floor gazes at her mirror hand again. The final line, &ldquo;make me three masks&rdquo; is heard before the total blackout.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The choreography is distinguished by frenetic energy that pervades much of Elena Laniog&rsquo;s later works. The bodies collect, build, and explode into convulsions tantamount to receiving a giant jolt of electricity. Yet, all the seemingly wild movements are precisely controlled and technically maneuvered. Striking movements include percussive breaks in the hips and shoulders, with arms making repetitive circular patterns around various select parts of the upper body. Many moments find the dancers&rsquo; hands brushing across their own faces as if soothing a headache, brushing away wayward locks of hair or a sheen of sweat, and masking anxiety. They appear to be in the vortex of a dream and trying to make sense of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not Laniog&rsquo;s first choreographic work but it showed her evolving signature style as she had been experimenting with a peculiar manner of movement that suited her loose-limbed and double-jointed body. The powerful attack of each dancer was a result of intensive training to master the wild gestures which were initially painful on the knees and lower back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although <strong><em>Mata sa Damgo</em></strong> did not win in the 2006 Mindanao Modern Dance Competition in Koronadal, it was thought to be ahead of its time. Years after, the movement vocabulary that developed from <strong><em>Mata sa Damgo</em></strong> inspired choreographic works by the younger generation of choreographers, especially from the UP Dance Program, who were trained in this technique and performed in Laniog&rsquo;s succeeding choreographies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Mata sa Damgo</em></strong> was shown in Kuala Lumpur at the Tari International Dance Festival in 2007 by Villanueva, Prudenciado, Revilla, Chantal and Nicole Primero, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4742\"><strong>Yvonne</strong></a> Torres, Yasnina Jumalon, and John Philip Martir. Lighting design for this performance was by Mele Yamomo. It was also restaged for the Dance, Young People, and Change Global Dance Festival at the Taipei National University, Taiwan, in 2012, performed by Chaya Joyce Baris, Sarah Maria Samaniego, Angella Betina Carlos, Angela Sebastian.

In its more or less original version, Act 2 was restaged for BalletPhilippines on Sep 1979 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2579\"><strong>Odon Sabarre</strong></a> and Lucy Layag de los Reyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 1, &ldquo;The Triangle,&rdquo; revolves around the rivalry between two Muslim princes of different tribes, Tasmi (&ldquo;noble and strong&rdquo;) and Achmed (&ldquo;aggressive and boastful&rdquo;), for the hand of a princess, Mir-i-nisa. Ceremonial entertainment is presented before the royal court of the datu and his many wives with a special slave dance and other court dances. Although Mir-i-nisa favors Tasmi and consorts with him in the woods, she cannot make a decision.A mock combat set between the tribes gets heated up, so the datu has to intervene. He drops a black pearl into the sea which should be recovered by whoever wants to be worthy of his daughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2, &ldquo;The Underwater,&rdquo; is a fantasy with varicolored pearls guarded by their respective nymphs.The pink-pearl dancers cascade like running waves, the blue-pearl dancers flow serenely on, and the white stalk and turn sharply. The black pearl is in a closed shell guarded by a sultry, almost jazzy, nymph, but Achmed seductively persuades her to give him the choice pearl. Earlier on, Tasmi had struggled with sea creatures and monsters but found no pearl at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 3, &ldquo;The Victor,&rdquo; shows Tasmi coming to shore tired and wounded. He is attended to by Mir-i-nisa who realizes he is the one she truly loves. But Achmed returns triumphant and declares himself the worthy man. The next scene is the celebration for the wedding, with Mir-i-nisa kept away in a high chamber, to be sought by her groom. In the tribal parade, the unhappy Mir-i-nisa is brought face to face with her groom. Many are surprised to find out that her groom is not Achmed but Tasmi. The datu explains that he actually threw not a pearl but a ball of black salt into the sea, and Tasmi proved to be the honest man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Mir-i-nisa</em></strong> was completely choreographed by EricV.Cruz for DanceConcertCompany, backed by some folk dancers and the UPFilipinianaDanceCompany, for performances at the Meralco Theater on 28 Nov 1976, at the University of the Philippines Theater on 1 Dec 1976, and at the CCP on 1 Jan 1978. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2431\"><strong>Arturo Cruz</strong></a> also designed new costumes, sets, and lights. Dancing as Mir-i-nisa was Heidi Domingo; Tasmi, RupertAcu&ntilde;a; Achmed, Louis Bayquen; and the datu, Patrick Baynes. Among the leading nymphs were Teresa Bautista and ShirleyHalili (Blue Pearl), Marivic Mapili (White Pearl and Queen of the Undersea), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><strong>Myra Beltran</strong></a> (Black Pearl).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Mir-i-nisa</em></strong> was last revived with new choreography by Borromeo and Layag-Radaic on 7 Apr 1989 at the CCP. It also marked the 21st anniversary of DTP, which was backed by PhilippineBalletTheatre and Maharlika Dance Group,with RamonObusan as ethnic dance consultant. New costume design was by Arturo Cruz, new set design by Carlito Se&ntilde;eres, Arnold Limjoco, and Marlon Reyes, and lighting design by Eric V. Cruz. Mir-i-nisa was played by Mylene Salda&ntilde;a; Tasmi, NonoyFroilan and OsiasBarroso; Achmed, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2409\"><strong>Raoul Banzon</strong></a>; and the datu, Sol Fernandez.

A ballet for the mass. Scenario, choreography, and costume design, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2621\"><u><strong>Basilio</strong> </u></a>; music (a capella in Latin), RyanCayabyab. Premiered by DanceTheaterPhilippines on 15 Dec 1984 at Puerta Real, Intramuros, Manila in practice costumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet follows the structure of a Catholic Mass, with sections called &ldquo;Kyrie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gloria,&rdquo; &ldquo;Credo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sanctus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Agnus Dei.&rdquo; The storyline narrates the martyrdom and resurrection of a central character called the Man in White.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Kyrie&rdquo; is an exhortation for mercy. Like the music that starts with an alto solo, soon joined by other voices, a file of dancers spills out in various directions, urgent in their pleas. The dancers weave in and out, crouched low or stretched up in supplication. With diminished energy, they gather into a line downstage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Gloria&rdquo; starts quietly. In turns, the dancers run and turn to break away. The music builds up, the dancers form a cross pathway, and the Man in White wearing a bush jacket and a cloak and carrying a white flag rushes in. Everyone hails him. Soon left alone, he kneels. Four men, dressed in blue and silver as soldiers, hesitantly approach him, then assault and pin him down. Ironically, to the music&rsquo;s exultation, the Man in White is stabbed by his own banner-staff as &ldquo;Jesu Cristo&rdquo; is sung. The soldiers raise the flag to signify their own victory and abandon his body.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Credo&rdquo; is the simplest section. Ten women stretch a scarlet cloth and walk a solemn procession from the wings or through a church aisle. Like many Veronicas, they wipe the man&rsquo;s face, and prop him up with the red cloth. He falls again. As the music crescendos, the soldiers drive away the women and carry the body away. The women sustain each other and dance out their distress, but end with a whispered &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sanctus&rdquo; has the two men at the beginning rejoining the women&rsquo;s circle. The music and movement are full of high hosannas. The revived Man in White returns, now stripped down to his white trousers.He comforts the women, especially the four Marys. The ever-intensifying action climaxes in a tableau. Like its ponderous music, &ldquo;Agnus Dei&rdquo; begins emotively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a canonic sequence, the dancers flagellate themselves. Ending in two distant lines, they tread towards each other to reach an invisible communion table with the Man in White at the head. As he slowly raises his arms, the communicants reach out to the audience, inviting them into the suggested sacrament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet was dedicated to &ldquo;Marcial Bonifacio,&rdquo; the alias of Benigno Aquino Jr, used when he returned to the Philippines and was assassinated in 1983. The Man in White is dressed as he was then, but universalized when stripped of his jacket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was previewed unfinished at Puerta Real on 21 Apr 1984 and in full at the University of the Philippines (UP) Church of the Risen Lord on 6 May 1984. It was performed on 30 Apr 1985 at the ManilaCathedral, before Jaime Cardinal Sin and Aquino&rsquo;s widow Corazon C. Aquino before she decided to run for president. It also celebrated the EDSA revolution in <strong><em>Pagdiriwang</em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1415\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/869\"><strong>Bayan Ko</strong></a></strong></a></em></strong> (A Celebration, My Country), 24-25 May 1986, at the Manila MetropolitanTheater. A choreographed version of the <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a></em></strong>,also by Basilio, was done by the UPConcertChorus in their 1983 international tour.

Early in the morning, the fishers depart for the sea. There is a flurry of activities as the town goes about the business of the day. The women and children settle down for the long wait for the return of the fishers. Then follows the storm and the anxieties it brings. The men return but for one, he who has saved all but has lost his own life. A great calm comes after the tragedy, and the folk accept their fate as people of the sea.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Anita M. Kane</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

These studies pioneered the &ldquo;moving pictures&rdquo; that later became known as the cinema. <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/171\"><strong>Muybridge Frames</strong></a></em></strong> begins with seven men clad in white shorts doing muscle-flexing movements in slow motion. Large shadows are cast on the backdrop. The shadows fade out, the men exit and the second section begins with movements that typify a race progressing into simultaneous individual and multiple images, leaps and runs freezing into shapes, then flowing into poses as in a multiple exposure. The third segment returns to the initial focused energy of the first movement with the shadows coming back, and ends with the men in a muscle-beach pose facing camera flashbulbs before the final blackout.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This piece was premiered during the CCP Dance School&rsquo;s 14th Summer Dance Workshop under a different title, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\"><strong>Photography</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em>A Gentleman&rsquo;s Honor</em></strong>,the title of the Philip Glass music which was used originally for the ballet.

Premiered by the dance major students of the University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman on 21 Mar 2013 at the College of Music Annex Garden, UP Diliman. Lead dancers: Michael Barry Que (man), Marielle Joy Baylocon (woman), Gillianne Therese Gequinto (<em>babaylan</em>), and Rolinda Gilbaliga (chanter).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/172\"><strong>Nasalapu-an</strong></a></em></strong>, or birthing in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a>-Kinaray-a dialect, is a contemporary ballet choreographed as part of <strong><em>Sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>Kamalig</strong></a>: Manood, Makinig</em></strong> (In the Granary: Watch, Listen), the production of Carlos and Cabling in 2013<em>.</em>It is a choreographic translation of the Panay Bukidnon tribe&rsquo;s <strong>binanog</strong> (hawk dance) and their birth ritual into contemporary dance. It is based on the research and fieldwork done by the choreographers and co-researcher Michael Que. Since chanting is a component in the tribe&rsquo;s birth ritual, the choreographers suggest this with the use and manipulation of colored cloths to symbolize the different functions of the chants; thus, the use of cloths introduces each segment of the ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet opens with a chant in Kiniray-a by Rolinda Gilbaliga, a Panay Bukidnon native, asking the gods to bless the child. She holds a long white cloth, unfolds it as she sings, and then hangs it on a bamboo pole. This creates an illusion of the literal &ldquo;passing through&rdquo; of the chant to the cloth which the woman in a later scene pulls on as she gives birth. The chant slightly overlaps with the dance of two groups of women stomping around the space, mirroring each other&rsquo;s movements and depicting a flock of birds. Each one holds a cloth, and all move together like birds soaring high. This scene called the &ldquo;Pagpapakilala at Pagpili ng Napupusuang Babae&rdquo; (Introducing and Choosing the Chosen Woman) also introduces the male protagonist who chooses his bride indicated by the play of scarves. The steps are close to the original binanogwith its stomping, leaning back, and capturing of each other with scarves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After this, the man and the woman tie the ends of their scarves to signify their union, in a duet titled &ldquo;Pagtatalik&rdquo; (Lovemaking). This has the enticing counter-pulling of the tied scarves. Then the couple moves among nine girls with their own scarves. They weave in and out of the girls, and pause at several points to show the passage of time. Meanwhile, the nine girls vigorously flourish their own scarves, hop, rock, and stomp. These girls represent the nine months of pregnancy, while the stage space indicates time. After the section with the nine girls, the scarves are then tied together to encircle the woman. They surreptitiously put their scarves under the woman&rsquo;s blouse and then exit. With this the woman is revealed as pregnant and ready to deliver. The man then seeks the babaylan&rsquo;shelp to drive away the evil spirits that may make his wife&rsquo;s delivery difficult.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next scene is &ldquo;Nasalapu-an&rdquo; (Birthing). A babaylanenters with a large red cloth. She goes into a trance&mdash;undulates, isolates parts of her body, turns, and extends her legs and arms, all the time flourishing the cloth to drive away the evil spirits. Then the babaylan places her cloth over the woman, symbolizing the chant&rsquo;s efficacy. To indicate birthing, the woman pulls on the white cloth that was earlier hung by the chanter on the pole. She mirrors the movements of the babaylan and joins her in pleading to the gods. To dramatize this scene, the corps of dancers surrounds the couple while beating their sticks on standing bamboos which make up the set. They count from one to nine in Tagalog, and go faster and faster to climax the scene with the child&rsquo;s birth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again the chanter enters to sing the same chant she sang at the beginning, but this time in Tagalog. After this, she dances the authentic binanog to thank the gods. As a community, the dancers join her in a dance as done by the traditional Panay Bukidnon, all to mark the birth of the child in this last scene called &ldquo;Pagdiriwang&rdquo;(Celebration).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the show&rsquo;s premiere the choreographers were invited by Professor Christine Muyco of the UP Diliman College of Music to present <strong><em>Nasalapu-an</em></strong> in Pagbayaw: A Conference on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1954\"><strong>Sugidanon</strong></a> in UP Visayas-Iloilo in 2013.

Not having anything else to give, she drops before him the diamond-studded locket Kapitan Tiago has but recently presented to her. The choreographer has changed the site from the street to the church interior. Music is by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\"><strong>Antonio Molina</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Salome and Elias,&rdquo; based on an unpublished chapter of the <strong><em>NoliMeTangere</em></strong>,shows Salome, the sweetheart of Elias as the unhappy victim of misfortune and oppression. A young barrio lass, she awaits Elias. He arrives, and the two dance the joy of reunion. A friend signals that civil guards are near. Elias leaves. Music is by Felipe Padilla de Leon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Gossips&rdquo; is a Terpsichorean caricature of Rizal&rsquo;s<em>hermanas</em>which is inspired by a single line from the novel: &ldquo;Sisafelt their icy stare and heard their whispers.&rdquo; Music is by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\"><strong>Lucrecia R. Kasilag</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Sisa&rdquo; shows the demented Sisa after Crispin&rsquo;s death, &ldquo;smiling, singing, and talking with the creatures of wood and field.&rdquo; She runs after a butterfly, falls, and bruises herself. The moments of her deepest anguish return. These are eased by the sweet recollection of a babe in her arms. Suddenly, out of the shadows, she imagines seeing the evil Do&ntilde;a Consolacion, who, to make her dance, has whipped her with the Alferez&rsquo;s whip. She relives the episode. Sisa&rsquo;s son Basilio, who has been looking for her for days, witnesses the scene. She does not recognize him. She tries to flee but is too exhausted. She falls. Basilio approaches and finds his mother dead. The boy throws his arms around her and weeps. Music is by Leonor Orosa-Goquingco and Luisa Torres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Asalto for Maria Clara&rdquo; opens with Maria Clara at the azotea,sad and alone. It is her birthday, and none of her friends seem to have remembered. But her friends give her an<em>asalto</em>or surprise party. The bits of innocent merriment are typical of Maria Clara&rsquo;s circle of friends. Music is by Nonato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Maria Clara and the Leper,&rdquo; to Molina&rsquo;s <strong><em>Preludio</em></strong><strong><em>y Romanza</em></strong> (Prelude and Romance),was premiered at the Escritores Hispanistas <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/482\"><strong>Velada</strong></a> de Gala on 18 Jun 1946, at the old Villamor Hall of the University of the Philippines.

When the king falls ill, the rivalry turns heinous, as the siblings plot to hasten their father&rsquo;s death.The god Bathala is so incensed that he turns the two princes into roosters.

Solo dance in three parts. Concept and choreography, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\"><u><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\"><strong>Denisa Reyes</strong></a></strong> </u></a>. Premiered in 1979 in New York City, in the concert titled <strong><em>Neo-Filipino</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This solo and the concert proved crucial in Reyes&rsquo;s choreographic development. The name &ldquo;Neo-Filipino&rdquo; eventually became the title of a choreographic series which best articulated Reyes&rsquo;s main choreographic interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/175\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Ton Pinay</strong></a></em></strong>, which is composed loosely of three parts, is a 15-minute solo where Reyes grapples with the subject of Filipino identity vis-&agrave;-vis colonial mentality, patriarchy, and Catholic suppression of sexuality. In a voice-over phone conversation, the woman soloist reveals that she is a waitress in New York. In a casual and carefree manner inflected by an American accent, the woman says she feels &ldquo;othered&rdquo; in this foreign country. A subsequent phone call disrupts her earlier brashness, self-confidence, and liberated attitude, replacing these with meekness, physical subservience, and a kind of obedience borne out of a Catholic upbringing. She is talking to her mother in the Philippines. From this palette, Reyes illustrates the contradiction of being a Filipino. As the woman reflects on her image on a mirror, her multiple selves unfold and unravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Between conversations that are heard as subtext in her mind, the woman articulates through her body the different cultural influences on the Filipino identity. That identity is a melange of Hispanized rural folk dances with gestures indicating Catholic fervor, traces of southern Philippine Muslim dance steps, interspersed with and disrupted by American military and jazz music. The solo climaxes in an appropriation of Cordillera dance and music, but it is at this point when the woman, in utter frustration, dances in frenzy and confusion. Getting a hold on herself, she then folds her skirt away, seemingly hiding her own contradictions from the audience. She snaps back to the present, and engages in another phone call.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reyes&rsquo;s piece bemoans the loss of the Filipino self and soul. In depicting the contradictory present linked to a complex past, Reyes traces the imprint of colonialism on the Filipino body that has perhaps, even altered the Filipino soul. Indeed, this lone woman in New York who waits on tables and serves the former colonizer of her home country, is tragic yet gallant in the ways she strives to survive and negotiate her contradictory realities. With the play on the words &ldquo;one ton&rdquo; and &ldquo;wanton,&rdquo; Reyes&rsquo;s solo takes a semi-autobiographical, self-reflexive stance that challenges too-neat conceptions of Filipino identity.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Myra Victoria C.

Cast: Kristin Jackson and Wendy Panganiban (alternating between 12-15 Nov), and Audie Gemora as narrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On stage are two folding screens, one standing and another, flat on the floor. A man walks in to introduce a story. It is about the seated woman dressed in a skirt and a blouse cut as a kimono. By the folded screen on the ground, she repetitively mimes rural tasks like clearing the ground, planting, harvesting, and winnowing. Then she carries the folded screen on her back and plods upstage. Beside the screen she mimes preparing food, offering it to an unseen person, and receiving payment. Again she moves away, now to downstage-right. There she dances sensually as though to entertain a client-spectator. All throughout, the narrator dispassionately watches her. He leads her upstage-right to the second, standing screen and opens it to show a heap of clothes. From there the woman picks up a white chemise and a white flower. She goes to the left, puts on the shift and the flower on her hair. Looking dejected, she sits, raises her hands only to lower them on her lap. Alerted to the singing of Santiago&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pakiusap,&rdquo; she rises and goes into a spell of abstract dance-moves. She goes back to the standing screen. There, she dips and zips herself into a lacy white gown from the floor. The narrator arranges the two screens beside her, to box her in. Before he finally does, she stops him, holds on a panel, and closes herself in. An overhead light starkly shows her silhouette. Slowly she sinks down with an upraised hand, until she completely disappears from view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suggesting an immaculate Madame Butterfly, the woman contrasts her dutifulness with her commodification. All along this is how the narrator advertises her, a packaged bride, sealed in her uncertain fate, yet a source for cash for those at home. <strong><em>Pakiusap</em></strong> shows these with candor and forceful conception.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

The other is a<em>babaylan</em>(female shaman) who offers betel nuts to the gods in a shrine, and gathers branches and flowers of the areca. Both minister to the datu&rsquo;s sons and other Bagobo youths, all imitating flying eagles to attain the status of<em>bagani</em>(warrior)<em>.</em>This rite supposedly washes away &ldquo;sins&rdquo; and leads to a new life (Obusan 1989).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the staged ritual, the youths are dressed in knee-length pants and open shirts or jackets, both dyed with geometric patterns. Wound around their heads are colorful kerchiefs. Tied to their arms are wooden shields representing wings of eagles. The babaylan wears a sweeping dark skirt and loose blouse. In a short prologue, she brandishes around the areca branches to call on the spirits. She dips the branches in an imaginary river on stage and with its water anoints the youths on their heads. This is done nine times, repeated when the men face the east. All these transpire to the eerie sounds of a wild forest, created by voices, creaking sounds, and rattling gongs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scene gets more active as the young men run and leap toward a suggested boulder downstage right corner. Their arms and shields look like wings in flight. At turns or intervals, they run, leap, and fall, in an attempt to fly. Obusan describes each one as &ldquo;a newly hatched egret ready to try his wings against his enemy, the menacing wind&rdquo; (Obusan 1989). At the end, they succeed and earn the status of bagani. In an epilogue, the babaylan returns to &ldquo;close the forest once more, only to be opened for the next <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/177\"><strong>Pamalugu</strong></a>&rdquo; (Obusan 1989).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance conveys the thrill of running and saulting, falling and rising, boldly attempted by the bagani individually or together. Portraying vigor and valor, the dance captivates with its kinesthetic dynamism and the exclusive mystery of the ritual happening in a dark forest by a river.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

For mothers, a daughter opens the prospect of securing a bountiful dowry. <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/178\"><strong>Pandamgo</strong></a></em></strong> tells its story in episodes before a seated audience. At the start, the mother sings to a baby represented by a folded cloth or<em>malong</em>(tubular skirt). She shuffles and shuttles around a small space. A little girl, dressed like her mother, enters and dances. With a slight stoop, the mother circles the girl and prettifies her. They dance an affectionate duet. In the next segment, the daughter is replaced by a young lady in similar clothes and ornaments. Again, the dance revolves around the daughter, with the mother ministering to her looks and needs. Then a young man shuffles in to join them. He solicits the attention of the young woman and offers her a necklace to represent his suit. The mother, however, does not like the man. Another man joins the trio, and he also offers another necklace to the young lady. The mother shows she favors this man, but the young woman refuses the necklace of the second man because she likes the first man. The circular shuffling leads to the young woman&rsquo;s explicit rejection of the second man. She throws his necklace to the ground. Because of this, a fight ensues between the two suitors. With long knives, they battle each other in a circle. The combat results in the death of both men and the women grieve over their favored one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Pandamgo</em></strong> shows a mother&rsquo;s story of raising a daughter. For the dance, the mother is dressed in traditional embroidered long-sleeved blouse and a multicolored woven malongfolded over her waist. Around her waist and hips is a brass belt made of strung chains that end in clinking bells. She also wears a necklace of beads, complemented by rows of beads over her hair. Her daughter, both as a little girl or adult wears a similar costume. For mother and daughter, the necklace is a running motif. The men wear dark-colored open shirts (jackets) and knee-length pants, both dyed and embroidered with geometric patterns.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Cast: Rizal Maribbay (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/179\"><strong>Pedro Kusinero</strong></a>), Ava Maureen Villanueva (Bailarina), Barney John Baris (El Kano), and Avel Bautista (Bugaw).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Pedro Kusinero</em></strong> is a deconstruction of the original ballet, 1911, set in a typical Russian fairground. Reset in Subic, Zambales, it calls attention to social and political issues in the Philippines, specifically the presence of American military bases. The four contending characters are Pedro Kusinero (Peter the cook), Bailarina (dancer-prostitute), El Kano (The American, a US serviceman), and Bugaw (Procurer-bouncer), all caught in a small bar-saloon by a US naval base. Pedro, an energetic but gawky cook, is infatuated with the club&rsquo;s choice and seductive Bailarina. But she is more enticed by the suave and cocky El Kano. Considering this mismatched triangle, Bugaw relegates Pedro to the kitchen. There Pedro vents his frustration in a percussive but puny frenzy, with a ladle and a potcover. Together, the other<em>bailarinas</em>entice the club clients by their sexually aggressive dancing. On the other hand, Bailarina and El Kano indulge in a flirtatious dalliance. Seeing this, Pedro rushes into the bar to disturb them. Offended, El Kano strangles Pedro to death and as a result, disorder and divided loyalties permeate the atmosphere. Bugaw tries to pacify everyone. Pedro&rsquo;s body is dragged out before a policeman arrives. In the end, everything seems quiet and fine, until the ghostlike Pedro slowly walks across the stage, before the eyes of Bugaw, Bailarina, and Kano&mdash;as though to haunt them in a kind of revenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Later performances gained from greater exploration of movement and plot, and more intensity in the projection of social issues. In these productions, Pedro Kusinero became a signature role for Al Bernard Garcia, 2009, 2010; with remarkable portrayals as Bailarina by Jantu Revilla, 2009, and Chaya Joyce Baris, 2010; as El Kano by Gerlin Francisco, 2009, and Japeth Mari Cabling in 2010; as Bugaw by Herbert Alvarez, 2009, and Peter Partida, 2010. For 2009 and 2010, Carlo Valderama designed new costumes and Joseph Matheu provided the lighting design. The ballet was featured at the WiFibody Festival in 2009 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. In 2010, during the 30th anniversary of the dance degree program at the UP College of Music, it was performed with the first live performance of Stravinsky&rsquo;s music in the Philippines, played by the UP Orchestra conducted by Edna Marcil Martinez.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Angela Lawenko Baguilat and Basilio Esteban S.

Restaged in 1941, and after World War II, in 1952 and 1961.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This suite of eight dances opens with a young woman in resplendent finery visiting an exhibition. Her promenade serves as transition to present the eight pictures. The first, &ldquo;The Gnome,&rdquo; reveals an unearthly Gnome half-hidden in the dense undergrowth of a primeval forest. Its dance builds on deliberate and slow lengthening of its body, as if trying to escape its own form. In contrast, &ldquo;The Castle&rdquo; finds a medieval scene and a sleeping troubadour who awakens to four elegant yet delicate princesses. He has amorous dalliances with them, each one seemingly unmoved by his fleeting attention. Romantic lyricism is evoked through the unhurried, leisurely movements and pace of the Middle Ages. At the end, the princesses return to the castle, the troubadour to his sleep, leaving the audience to wonder whether it was dream or reality. Easily the most impressive is &ldquo;The Cart.&rdquo; It shows a haggard-looking Dubsky-Zipper in a deep lunge, dragging behind three men linked at various levels. Against a bare tree backdropped by endless rows of barren, furrowed earth, she dramatically enunciates&mdash;in heavy, wearisome, segmented undulations&mdash;the hopelessness of the peasants in their toil. A spark of rebellion flashes, but hopelessness dispels the independent spirit. The cart symbolizes an eternity of toil. &ldquo;Children in the Tuilleries&rdquo; charms with its beribboned children in pastel shades, playing with a golden ball. Their energetic play develops into a petty quarrel, which is soon forgotten when they attend to the ball again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A sharp, cleverly paced comedy, &ldquo;The Marketplace&rdquo; captures the inherent energy of vendors and onlookers. To spite a finicky spinster, the vendors connive to ignore a light-fingered thief. The rousing pace and staccato movements build up to an unexpected finish, leaving the audience laughing and breathless. As respite, &ldquo;The Catacombs&rdquo; captures the stillness and near-ritualistic mien of monks. In the silence of a Gothic crypt, the monks dance with minimal expression and movement. At the end, they dance with lighted candles which help to bring up the scene. In contrast, &ldquo;The Witch&rdquo; is vigorous. With her hair down and in her garb in hues of orange, gold and black, Dubsky-Zipper as the witch effortlessly displays her extraordinary ballon. From a crouch, she leaps to uncoil her body in the air, head thrown back. Then she spirals her torso as her arms circle overhead, legs tucked underneath her. She runs around an immense cauldron with flames effected by dancers in black, arms with red and yellow strips, simulating flames. For a breather, three affectionate cats slither close to her. She tires of them, resumes her jumps, and returns to her smoking cauldron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last painting, &ldquo;The Great Gates of Kiev,&rdquo; is performed in formal balance and linear movements.These emphases are repeated in the silver decor on the skirt, sleeves, pockets, belt, and headdresses of the Cossacks. Sequential, straight arm movements, rebounding points of the feet, and formal groupings symbolize the gates of Kiev.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A.V.Hartendorp sums up his impression of the ballet: &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> can hardly conceive of a program more inclusive in scope and more perfectly balanced than that offered, which ranged from the lyric, through the dramatic and comic with an unfailing sense of proportion and value in line, movement and color, and which throughout gave evidence of her most original genius&rdquo; (Hartendorp 1940).<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

It dramatizes his love for Sita, and the trials he must undergo before he becomes a mighty ruler.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 1 opens with Rama and his brother Lakshmana being warmly welcomed home by the people of the kingdom of Mithila. Later, the brothers hear that Sita, the beautiful daughter of King Janaka, is throwing a<em>swayamwara</em>,a contest by which a girl would choose a husband for herself. At the said occasion, Rama meets Sita, and he immediately falls for her. After passing a tough test given by King Janaka, Rama is wedded to Sita in a grand and royal ceremony. Meanwhile, the ailing King Dasaratha has already decided to pass on the crown to his son, Rama&mdash;a gesture that angers Kaikeyi, Dasaratha&rsquo;s third wife. Aided by the dubious Kooni, Kaikeyi plots to disrupt the coronation of Rama. In exchange for saving the king&rsquo;s life in the past, Kaikeyi demands that her son Bharatha be crowned king, and that Rama be banished from the kingdom. Dasaratha reverses his decision, and Rama is exiled with Sita and Lakshmana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 follows the journeys of the three exiles as they head for the woods of Panchavati, where the chameleonlike demon Ravana persistently attacks the lovely Sita, even as the impish Soorpanakha, Ravana&rsquo;s sister, wildly pursues Rama. Lakshmana mutilates Soorpanakha&rsquo;s ears, nose and breasts; and Ravana, avenging his sister&rsquo;s mutilation and using various disguises, succeeds in abducting Sita. The aggrieved Rama seeks the help of Sagreeva, king of the monkey people in Kiskinda. The king, who is indebted to Rama who helped him regain his crown, orders his army and his general, Hanuman, to assist Rama in rescuing Sita from the lair of Ravana. The battle is later won by Rama, Sagreeva, Hanuman, and the monkey army. Rama kills Ravana and Sita is freed. In the end, the people of Mithila celebrate the return of Rama and Sita with Lakshmana, and their coronation as rulers of Mithila <strong>.</strong> </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alice Reyes interprets the ballet in the rock opera medium in two acts and nine scenes, as a way of introducing the Indian classic to contemporary Filipino audiences. Instead of separating the singers from the dancers, as in her previous hits, <strong><em>Tommy</em></strong> and <strong><em>TalesoftheManuvu</em></strong>,Reyes challenged herself in <strong><em>Rama</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hari</em></strong> by weaving them in and out of dancers and dances. She also used diverse elements of Asian theater, such as the shadow play and various hand props, as well as Indian dance movements interpreted in modern choreography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Librettist Lumbera wrote a script with varying levels of usage: an elevated diction for the protagonist and Filipino slang for the demons Ravana and Soorpanakha. The theatrical reason for this, he explains, was that &ldquo;the intrusion of a very contemporary diction could jar the audience into perceiving that the ancient epic of India is also &lsquo;now&rsquo; and &lsquo;Filipino&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complementing Lumbera&rsquo;s libretto is Cayabyab&rsquo;s musical score, which incorporated the Filipino<em>kundiman</em>, Indian melodies, Asian percussion and popular tunes in his first rock opera ballet composition. Designer Bernal, in keeping with the theme of <strong><em>Rama</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hari</em></strong>,designed sets and costumes in a stylized Oriental look which were further enhanced by Catoy&rsquo;s lighting design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After its premiere presentation in Manila, <strong><em>Rama,</em></strong><strong><em>Hari</em></strong> was performed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a> at the Musika Malaysia Festival in May 1981; the Sixth Hong Kong Festival of Asian Arts in Oct 1981; the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei, Taiwan in Nov 1982; and during the Visayan-Mindanao Cultural Circuit Tour, sponsored by CCP, in Jun 1982.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The Philippines proposed <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/183\"><strong>Realizing Rama</strong></a></em></strong>, a collaborative modern dance production based on the Asian epic <strong><em>Ramayana</em></strong>, as one of these flagship projects. The proposal was approved by COCI and the project planning began in mid-1997 with the proponent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2495\"><strong>Nestor Jardin</strong></a> as project director. The production team was composed of representatives from the ten ASEAN member countries. The cast consisted of twenty-two traditional, classical, and contemporary and dance artists from the ten member countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiongson wrote the libretto for the full-length production as a contemporary adaptation of the epic. He focused on the theme of selfless leadership with Rama representing the ideal statesman. The production consists of a prologue, two acts with five scenes, and an epilogue. The prologue, set in the Kingdom of Ayodhaya, depicts the competition for the hand of Sita which Rama wins by bending the bow into the shape of a heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 1 begins with the wedding of Rama and Sita at the court of Ayodhaya. King Dasaratha decides to bequeath his crown to Rama but Kaikeyi, one the King&rsquo;s three wives, objects and demands that her son, Bharata, be the anointed one. Exacting a debt of gratitude from the King, Kaikeyi succeeds and demands that Rama be exiled. Together with Sita (his Heart) and Lakshmana (his Mind), Rama traverses mountains and rivers, always trying to create a balance between heart and mind. He first encounters three monsters, representing the opportunism, frivolity and pragmatism of Wealth, which try to manipulate him. He is also seduced by Surphanaka, representing Lust, who tries to arouse his basic instincts. Lastly, he comes upon the monster Khara, representing Power, which entices him to manipulate people. With the help of Sita and Lakshmana, Rama&rsquo;s willpower prevails and he successfully overcomes these temptations laid out by the evil God, Ravana. Undaunted by these failures, Ravana unleashes his monster machine of Wealth, Lust, and Power and lets loose the Golden Deer of Materialism to lure Sita as a prelude leading to her abduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 2 is set in the forest of Lanka where the army of Bali, composed of black monkeys, destroys the trees to feed Ravana&rsquo;s monster machine. Rama aids Sugriva, King of the good monkeys, and his general Hanuman to battle and defeat the army of Bali. Meanwhile, Ravana attempts to seduce and force himself upon Sita but she drives him away. Hanuman is able to get to Sita who gives him her wedding necklace as a symbol of her undying love for Rama. Upon learning of Sita&rsquo;s fate, Rama, assisted by Sugriva, Hanuman, and their army, builds a bridge to Lanka where they rescue Sita. In the final battle, Rama fights Ravana in a hand-to-hand combat symbolizing the fight between good and evil, and the struggle against poverty, environmental destruction, exploitation of labor, women, and children, and drug trafficking. Rama is victorious and gouges out Ravana&rsquo;s black heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the epilogue, Rama returns to Ayodhaya and ascends to the throne with Sita and Lakshmana beside him. Finally, after his travails, balance is achieved and he is freed from obsession with Wealth, Lust, and Power, thus transforming him into a true leader of his kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reyes closely collaborated with the ASEAN dancers to create movements and choreographic patterns that fuse modern dance with indigenous, folk, and classical dances. While the result is an eclectic dance vocabulary, the contemporary dance base provides a choreographic style combining all the elements into a cohesive and expressive production. Rahayu Supanggah, a noted composer and ethnomusicologist from Java, created a contemporary musical score fusing traditional Javanese and ASEAN musical idioms, musical instruments. The visual aspects of the production which consist of costumes and sets by Salvador Bernal (later National Artist of the Philippines), lighting design by Katsch S. J. Catoy and subsequently by Shoko Matsumoto, as well as the videography by Ami Miciano and later on by Mark Gary, provided an effective visual support for the story-telling and choreography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the world premiere of <strong><em>Realizing Rama</em></strong> in 1998 in Hanoi on the occasion of the 6th ASEAN Summit, it had a second performance also in Hanoi and a third in Ho Chi Minh City. In Sep 1999, the artistic team revised and polished some aspects of the production before embarking on its first touring phase. From Sep 1999 to Apr 2000, the production toured the Philippines, Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Cambodia, thus completing its circuit tour of ASEAN. The success of the show was evident in the rave reviews it received from critics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Realizing Rama</em></strong> &rsquo;s huge impact on creating ASEAN awareness prompted the COCI to organize tours of the production outside the region. From May to Jul 2001, it was performed in four cities of Europe, namely Berlin, London, Luxembourg, and Brussels. In 2002, the show toured Seoul, Beijing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, New Delhi, Chennai, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/39\"><strong>Banga</strong></a>lore, and Mumbai. The most successful run of the show was in India, the birthplace of the <strong><em>Ramayana</em></strong>. In Oct 2003, the production was restaged in Manila and brought to Japan for performances in Yokohama and Osaka. Its last performances were held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a> in 2006 as part of the 31st UNESCO International Theater Institute World Congress.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Nestor O.

Then, they are swept by the forces of evil and seek profit at any cost. Finally, they embark on constructive industry to rebuild their lives. The spirit of virtue, unmasking evil, lets the true spirit of the Philippines grow in statesmanship and prosperity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scenes are: &ldquo;Destruction and Devastation,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Will to Live as the Victory Parade Passes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Dance of Youth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Revival of Society,&rdquo; &ldquo;Degradation of Society,&rdquo; &ldquo;Restlessness of Society,&rdquo; &ldquo;Evil Unmasked Is Blind,&rdquo; &ldquo;Awakening of State,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Revival of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>ity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Industry Establishes a Normal Society,&rdquo; &ldquo;Statemanship Restores the Sight of Repentant Evil,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Consciousness of God.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Anita M.

In the catacomb scene, for instance, the ancestral statues of the Capulets loomed over the lovers in a scale that demonstrates the large social forces that dominate their lives. Duque&rsquo;s atmospheric and poetic lighting, particularly in the chapel and balcony scenes, and in Juliet&rsquo;s funeral procession in the Capulet crypt, highlighted the concept of Bernal&rsquo;s design, and added to the dramatic commitment of the ballet.

Dancers: Jacqui Jacinto, Anna Marie Bartolome, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2493\"><strong>Quincy Jacinto</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2492\"><strong>Lucas Jacinto</strong></a>, Sol Ogatis, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2491\"><strong>Joelle Jacinto</strong></a>, Cecilia Bartolome, Margarita Santos, Louella Alfonso. A smaller cast performed this work in 1992 at the Meralco Theater, with some rechoreographed sequences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacinto was the recipient of the CCP&rsquo;s 1991 venue grant, and he produced a mixed bill show titled <strong><em>Dating Gawi, Bagong Anyo</em></strong> (Old Ways, New Image). Included was a suite titled <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/186\"><strong>Sa Panimula ng Buhay</strong></a></em></strong>, which explored the Filipino creation myth where the first peoples were molded from clay by Bathala (God), thereafter populating the world. Jacinto had been experimenting with abstract forms in the 1980s but started to adapt folk dance gestures into more fluid, contemporary movement later in that decade. He melded these two choreographic styles in <strong><em>Sa Panimula ng Buhay</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first section is the creation myth, where a figure arises from the earth, shaking as if life were breathed into her body. She then becomes a medium for the unseen deity which starts to mold a second figure from the clay, grabbing light and air from the sky, pressing hands down on the figure&rsquo;s back, and shaking violently as she breathes life into this new figure. &ldquo;Breathe&rdquo; is used to describe the movement because the accompanying soundscape is a recording of actual breathing&mdash;of inhaling and exhaling. When the two figures are formed, they squat side by side and assess the rest of the lonely earth, arms stretched out and resting over their bent knees, mouths pouting, resembling the traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a><em>bulol</em>or rice deity icon<em>.</em>The two move across the stage, breathing life into several other bodies in succession, and therefore into the rest of mankind which, when fully formed, begin to dance. The second and third sections show the formation of the community, the people&rsquo;s observation of the laws that were put in place, and the empowerment of their children. Still quite abstract, the dance has no story, only a general impression of what early civilization must have looked like. The movements are mostly a fusion of modern dance and folk dance steps, punctuated by modernized ballet poses and combinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> section has two female dancers sharply hopping on one leg while the other leg and both arms are bent angularly. The hands are thrown out as one leg straightens and the grounded foot rises on toes. The hopping is taken from folk dance, abstracted by the flexed feet and turned-in legs that are definitive of modern dance; the rising of the feet on toes is a <strong><em>relev&eacute;</em></strong> in ballet.The two women introduce tension in the otherwise placid community when they confront a male warrior. The warrior writhes on the ground while the chief female passes judgment on him as she steps into a <strong><em>pos&eacute; attitude</em></strong> over his supine body, her arms raised in a V-form with hands flexed. The female corps behind them are in lower <strong><em>attitudes en fondu</em></strong>, the fingers of their flexed hands flicking as seen in several dances from the Cordillera region. Another section has the female dancers carrying two large bamboo poles across the stage while executing a simple, repetitive step-close pattern, to symbolize the building of material dwelling places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although all performers are dressed and dancing as a neutral corps de ballet in most parts of the work with, some dancers break out from the corps to perform a specific function, such as the medicine woman emerging from the bamboo poles in order to perform a blessing ritual. Her movements combine knee and head jerks, contracted bowing of the head to the ground in angular poses, and legs bent in a balletic second position. Jacinto&rsquo;s work ends with a proud community, untouched by foreign influence. Jacinto draws much from his folk dance background when he performed for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2535\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2536\"><strong>Rosalia Merino-Santos</strong></a></strong></a> at FEU and the side projects of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a>. Contemporizing folk movements, which was Santos&rsquo;s influence, was a signature of much of his later works, particularly <strong><em>Bathala</em></strong> (God), 1998; and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/145\"><strong>Giri</strong></a></em></strong> (Strut), 2004, both for TEAM Dance Studio; and <strong><em>Magdaragat</em></strong> (Seafarer), 1996, for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Theatre</strong></a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

At the end of the exposition of each section, Inang Bayan performs a dance exhorting her children to struggle free from the fetters that bind their own sectors, prefiguring the triumphs of each of her children and of the country as a whole. The performance ends as it began&mdash;with a child&rsquo;s continuing search for the truth that will finally set the people free. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Bantugan notices that even in her fright, her movements are light and graceful. He falls in love with Gandingan, and saves her from danger. As told by Maranao anthropologist Mamintua Saber, the dance imitates the graceful movements of Princess Gandingan as she leaps from rock to rock. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> poles are struck together to imitate the crashing of rocks during earthquakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a>&rsquo;s signature piece, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/188\"><strong>Singkil</strong></a></strong></a></em></strong>,takes its name from the heavy metal anklets called<em>singkil</em>worn by Maranao princesses.

In the novel, Sisa is mute and defenseless, in the mold of the downtrodden peasants in the Spanish colonized Philippines while Padre Salvi, the antagonist, is the epitome of the arrogant colonizer, devoid of altruism and compassion. Drawing her picture from the <strong><em>Noli</em></strong>,playwright Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio resurrected Sisa as vindictive and eloquent, and Salvi as troubled and repentant.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The ballet opens with Padre Salvi looking for Sisa&rsquo;s grave to seek atonement for his sins. In the manner of the<em>noh</em>,Sisa enters from the shadows, leading her two sons, Basilio and Crispin. They dance their thoughts and grievances, their bodies and arms often upturned to the heavens as if asking, &ldquo;why?&rdquo; They are linked to each other throughout, symbolic of the close bond between mother and sons. In the ensuing confrontation with Salvi, Sisa poignantly reviews, through merciless tirades, the events of her tragic life. She condemns Salvi to eternal unrest and warns the audience not to suffer in silence like her but to find their voices, declare their rights and finally recreate a free Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True to the traditional noh, a chorus of women with sphinx-like faces weave in and out of the scenes. They are all knowing, all-seeing, yet unmoved by the occurrences.The music combines the hispanic air and the emotion-filled, rhythmically diverse<em>utai</em>(the chanted text). The choreography follows the rhythmic patterns and moods evoked by the utai and added chants composed by AntonioMabesa. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Full-length solo. Choreography, story based on folktale, and performance by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><u><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><strong>Myra Beltran</strong></a></strong> </u></a>; music by Johann Sebastian Bach. Premiered on 19 Mar 1997 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2442\"><strong>Dance Forum</strong></a> Studio, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/190\"><strong>Star Maiden</strong></a></em></strong> is a full-length solo comprising of seven dances tied together by a narration which presages each solo. Based on a folktale found in the Cordillera and Bukidnon regions in the Philippines, it is about a farmer and a star maiden who becomes his wife. The narrative about a farmer stealing the wings of a maiden who comes down from the heavens, a narrative signifying the marriage of heaven and earth, is a common motif among Asian folktales. Because it is believed that the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> Bontoc people come from the marriage of this farmer and the maiden, the tale is essentially an origin myth.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Beltran&rsquo;s version, the story is given a feminist reading and rendered in more poetic terms. While other feminists would read the story as a form of betrayal and a clipping of women&rsquo;s powers, Beltran looks at the story in terms of the inner journey of a woman who realizes her gifts and powers and eventually experiences a rebirth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All seven dances of five to seven minutes each with accompanying narration conveys the various steps taken in a mythic and inner journey. Loosely and visually based on various Philippine legends, all dances could be considered complete and stand-alone pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first dance, &ldquo;Silver Streak of Wings,&rdquo; the maiden finds her broken wings hidden in an attic, a metaphor for the discovery of one&rsquo;s woundedness. Beltran expresses in dance how the maiden as wife of the farmer, learns the earth&rsquo;s various cycles&mdash;&ldquo;of loving, dying, of giving one&rsquo;s self, and of waiting.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The second dance titled &ldquo;Beginning&rdquo; is about liberation. Beltran&rsquo;s airy delicacy conveys a certain joy of solitude under the freedom of moonlight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third dance, &ldquo;Cloak of Midnight,&rdquo; is performed with three grey stones on the floor to establish a river setting that introduces floor work movements. The universe quietly grieves with the maiden, providing her comfort and enabling her to hear the &ldquo;light tapping of wings&rdquo; on the water, a reminder of her destiny to be free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The maiden continues her journey by climbing a mountain to claim the lessons learned in her earthly life. The fourth dance titled &ldquo;Rock Me to Sleep&rdquo; renders the image of Sisyphus with Beltran pushing a rock-like set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Air,&rdquo; the fifth dance, shows the maiden coming &ldquo;to the edge of the earth&rdquo; and with &ldquo;just another stretch of soul,&rdquo; she crosses the water. In the sixth dance, &ldquo;Song,&rdquo; the heavens celebrate the star maiden&rsquo;s life on earth and lift her up to her original abode in a carpet of white flowers strewn across the floor. The final dance, &ldquo;Star Maiden,&rdquo; reveals that the narrator is actually the child of the star maiden and the farmer. The entire solo reaffirms the tale as a traditional origin myth made poetic by the presence of both the artist who is its storyteller and the artist as the child, the realization of the marriage between heaven and earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beltran&rsquo;s performance evokes the anguish of leaving a loved one despite one&rsquo;s own decision to do so. Beltran&rsquo;s willowy form shows the lines of classical ballet redefined in her own way within the intimate venue and non-proscenium stage. She conveys the story by using simple and minimal props like stones and flowers. Change in the color of costumes signifies the inner transformations of the maiden. Her movements express the shift in emotions and evoke the geography of the Philippine archipelago. The Philippine landscape is a shorthand for the mythic journey to the self; the traversing of land, mountain, and water parallels the transition to a new life, and finally to a rebirth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Star Maiden</em></strong> &rsquo;s premiere in Mar 1997 marked the opening of a studio as an alternative performance space. The opening could be likened to a gathering of storytellers or shamans as Beltran&rsquo;s studio is structured like the<em>dap-ay</em>(an indigenous house) of the Northern Philippines. The show was restaged for Casa San Miguel, Zambales, in 1998 and its various solos were shown separately on several occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Star Maiden</em></strong> was crucial in Beltran&rsquo;s choreographic career because it announced to the arts world the workings of contemporary choreography and production. The artist as producer, writer, choreographer, and dancer ushered in a new way of working as independent artist. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Ruth Jordana L.

Suwana is played by two people. The actor Ditchay Roxas is Suwana the narrator and the private self, while the dancer Camille Ordinario is Suwana the mirror, and the public self, or how Suwana shows herself to other people. For example, when the public self gets married, the private self screams, &ldquo;<em>Huwag!</em>&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t!). Suwana&rsquo;s grey-haired mother in blue also symbolizes both Mother Earth and the Wise Woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Suwana</em></strong> is seen as Reyes&rsquo;s most feminist work, although she claims that it promotes the interdependency between man and woman, rather than denying a woman&rsquo;s need for a man. As portrayed, the first section is Suwana&rsquo;s retrospective account of her life, with Suwana commenting on it while watching. It is a very angry portrait of the roles women are forced to take on. The dance opens with a woman reflecting on her life, sitting in a hammock held aloft in the shape of a triangle across the cyclorama, made to resemble a vagina, while another older woman in blue is bound while giving birth. The woman in the hammock is actually watching over her own birth as she recites a story about a skeleton woman. She says, &ldquo;Suwana,<em>babae</em>(woman) &hellip; Suwana,<em>anak</em>(child/daughter) &hellip; Suwana,<em>kabiyak</em>(partner) &hellip;&rdquo; as if to declare the roles that she was born into. Other voices emphasize this imposition of roles, as they accompany the scenes from Suwana&rsquo;s childhood with &ldquo;yes&rdquo; phrases, such as &ldquo;Yes, dear,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; There are negative phrases admonishing daughters, such as &ldquo;Put down your skirt so that we don&rsquo;t see your panties&rdquo; or &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find a husband if you act that way.&rdquo; Overheard are common descriptions of a woman&rsquo;s ideal man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the public and private selves of Suwana dance with a group of girls who put on blouses onstage as they assume prescribed roles or costumes: office secretary, house maid, nun, and whore. When it is the whore&rsquo;s turn to dance, only the private self dances with her while the rest watch, appalled. Ironically, the private self of Suwana and perhaps all the women seem to want to be as wanton and uninhibited as the whore. But the other women restrain themselves due to social constraints. Then the women put on long Maria Clara skirts, again taking on societal roles. Male characters enter the scene and dominate the last scene of the first section. They objectify the women, surrounding and watching them with blank faces. Other men dressed as priests enter when the Wise Woman falls to her death and they remove her body/presence. The men return to surround Suwana&rsquo;s private and public selves, assume alternatively sexual and religious poses, before attacking her. The private self is tied to large ropes, in a position similar to how the Wise Woman was bound in the earlier birth scene. Meanwhile the men encircle the public self, forcing her into submission. When the public self successfully pushes the men away, the private self is freed from her bonds, after which the two selves embrace each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second section is shorter and focuses on the story of the Skeleton Woman. The private self repeats her recitation of the story about a fisherman who pulls out his nets from the sea and finds the skeleton woman amid the garbage from the bottom of the ocean. While speaking, the fisherman sheds a tear while dreaming, and the skeleton woman drinks that tear as if it were a river. Then her bones fill out with flesh; she is made whole by the fisherman&rsquo;s tear and by singing, she stirs a happiness inside him. They spend the rest of their lives together, singing and dreaming. In the dance, Suwana the mirror is also the Skeleton Woman. She and the fisherman discover each other through both violence and tenderness. She alternately grabs him and pushes him away, traumatized by her own past. In the end, she refuses to lose herself to the man. But they finally meet halfway and accept each other. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence B.

The theme is based on a research effort by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a> team headed by Helena Z. Benitez, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a>, Jolly Benitez, and Ileana Maramag. The dances, chants, music, costumes, epics, folklore, brass work, and weaving were studied and gathered through the cooperation of the Santa Cruz Mission of Lake Sebu, with Fr Rex Marsmann, and Datu Mafok Yet-lu, the first of his four wives, and his people.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The plot sequence was inspired by a Tboli story that has traditionally been woven into a beautiful abaca cloth called<em>tinalak</em>.<em></em>The dramatic suite is a tale of retribution. A ruling datu has a favorite wife, who attempts to seduce her lord&rsquo;s younger brother. In a fit of jealousy, the datu slays his brother.As punishment of the god Diwata, the datu&rsquo;s one and only daughter falls ill. According to traditional Tboli belief, the daughter can only be saved through marriage. Neighboring tribes and four noble suitors vie for her hand, each with a different dance. A poet-prince is finally chosen by the princess, but she goes into a trance from which she never awakens. The tale ends with the symbolic burning of the datu&rsquo;s house and village by the datu himself, in recognition of the death of his line and to get rid of the evil spirits lurking around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After its premier, the dance was included in the Bayanihan&rsquo;s repertory for its 1967-1968 world tour. It has since been periodically revived. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The play begins with a traditional prologue, &ldquo;Tabbayannon,&rdquo; in which the content and method of the presentation are explained. The story narrates the beginning of all things with the good god Manama who is surrounded by<em>diwata</em>(guardian spirit)andanitoand is confident of his omnipotence.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Counteracting his powers is the evil god Ogassi who is assisted by the<em>busaw</em>(bad spirits). With only a<em>katungaw-tungaw</em>tree growing in his realm, Manama&rsquo;s land is barren, in contrast to Ogassi&rsquo;s which is lush with vegetation. This starts the enmity between them or between good and evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manama is asleep for the greater part of the year, but wakes up for a brief while to get his divine tasks done. He thinks up Man and the entire skyworld is mobilized to realize his grand project. But when he dozes off, Ogassi manages to subvert the project and messes up Manama&rsquo;s plan to give Man eternal life. When he comes to life, Man is only too grateful for the opportunity to explore the world, and cannot care about the brevity of existence. Defeated, Ogassi persists in creating discontent in Manama&rsquo;s creature by asking Man why he is alone. In turn, Man asks Manama why he is without a counterpart. Manama knows that his creation would cease to depend on him once he is given a counterpart; however, to deny him a partner would be giving Ogassi his victory, and so Manama creates the First Woman. Ogassi stirs up indefinable longings in the First Woman. She is disconsolate over a sense of incompleteness she cannot understand. Before Ogassi scores another victory, Manama drops a<em>kakapa</em>(worm) on the buttocks of man, whose resultant movements lead to the discovery of the pleasures of sex.In the course of time, Nature becomes less benign, and the goodwill among men disappears. Men and women pounding rice disrupt Manama&rsquo;s sleep, and, in a fit of irascibility, he orders the skyworld to be raised beyond the reach of people so he can sleep unperturbed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now unhampered by his rival, Ogassi creates the giant Makarallig who drives people away from their lands, spreading death and destruction everywhere. Realizing that they have no one to turn to but themselves, the people organize themselves to fight off the giant, and succeed in driving the marauder and Ogassi away. The people realize through their struggle that they have within themselves the resources to create their own fate. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

In 1990, it was brought into the repertoire of PhilippineBalletTheatre with sets by Rollie de Leon and costumes by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2431\"><strong>Arturo Cruz</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Scene 1 opens with Mang Basio flirting with Aling Tale, a<em>sari-sari</em>(variety) storekeeper. A habitual drunkard and<em>sabungero</em>(cockfight enthusiast), Basio mimes out his vices and dances with Tale all the way up a long bench (a stylized<em>sayaw sa bangko</em>) until he falls. A lad finishes the dance for him. Maria, daughter of the rich Do&ntilde;a Pepang, comes out with her friends and dances with her suitor, Kardo, son of Basio. But Do&ntilde;a Pepang comes looking for Maria, who hides among her friends. Spotted, Maria is pinched on the ear to an instantaneous blackout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scene 2 finds Maria unable to sleep, mooning around her room and preparing a bundle for an elopement. To guard Maria, Do&ntilde;a Pepang sits and dozes in a rattan rocking chair outside the door. Outside the house, Kardo and his father dance while carrying a bamboo ladder. Leaning the ladder by Maria&rsquo;s window, the old man climbs up but falls upon Kardo&rsquo;s whistled signal. Kardo climbs up.Basio is still on guard, but soon falls asleep. Inside, Maria is surprised in her chemise; with a shawl, she dances out her love with Kardo, with some sulking. Hearing the noise, Do&ntilde;a Pepang knocks on Maria&rsquo;s door. Kardo scampers around but finally dives into a large bamboo clothes hamper. Maria pretends to sleep. With her sharp fan, Do&ntilde;a Pepang wakes Maria up and gesticulates her questions. At times, Kardo sticks his head out of the hamper. Do&ntilde;a Pepang catches sight of him and promptly faints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scene 3 witnesses the merrymaking of Maria and Kardo&rsquo;s friends. A bamboo arch stands for a church door from where the bride and groom dance out, followed by Do&ntilde;a Pepang and Basio, followed in turn by Aling Tale. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\"><strong>Photography</strong></a> freezes everyone in various poses for an instant. Then everyone files out in parade, dancing and miming the passing of a calesaas the music diminishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Tanan</em></strong> is a short but popular comedy, a ballet showing local color in dancing, acting, and the style of the production and costume designs. The music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\"><strong>Juan Silos</strong></a> Jr is made up of familiar folk melodies, arranged to fit exactly the swift scenes, short dances, and rollicksome miming. It has enjoyed 23 years of performances and has been danced in England, Scotland, Hong Kong, and in various Philippine provinces. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Modern ballet. Scenario and choreography, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2621\"><u><strong>Basilio</strong> </u></a>; music, Peter I. Tchaikovsky ( <strong><em>Souvenir de Florence</em></strong> ); lighting design, Raymond Salvacion; costume and set design, Raquel Rey.Premiered by DanceTheaterPhilippines on 20 Nov 1982 at the Meralco Theater, to herald the 90th death anniversary of the Russian composer Tchaikovsky in 1983. Dancers: AugustusDamian (Peter), AnnaVilladolid (Antonina), Sophia Radaic (Nadezhda).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ballet had an earlier, capsulized version in 1976, <strong><em>Perjured Hearts</em></strong> (to Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Autumn&rdquo; in <strong><em>The Months</em></strong> ),choreographed for OdonSabarre (Peter), VellaDamian (Nadezhda), and Josette Salang (Antonina). In some way the notes to that piece summarizes <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/195\"><strong>Tchaikovsky Fantasy</strong></a></em></strong> <em>:</em>&ldquo;A lyric and liberal interpretation of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s affairs. He and Madam (Nadezhda) von Meck, his patroness, were supposed to have never met but exchanged ardent letters, while Antonina, his wife of an impulsive marriage, he never truly loved.&rdquo; The latter ballet further develops a &ldquo;fantasy&rdquo; about this aspect of the life of the composer. The added corps de ballet also functions as a chorus.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the curtain rises, the theme of the &ldquo;Allegro con Spirito&rdquo; is established. The stage opens on three cages which enclose the three main figures of the ballet. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the cages rises, freeing Antonina to dance her feelings out with the corps de ballet. After a brief absence, she returns to draw out Peter from his caged spot to dance with her, and Nadezhda to establish her mysterious presence. The dance of Antonina and Peter grows from hesitancy to fuller involvement. In the &ldquo;Andante Cantabile e con moto,&rdquo; Nadezhda replaces Antonina in a pensive solo. Then Peter joins her for an involved pas de deux. The two avoid each other&rsquo;s eyes&mdash;to suggest that in real life they were never close. A series of swirling musical and dancing passages separate them. Left alone, Peter gives vent to his longings and anguish to a sad melody. Three female &ldquo;images&rdquo; confront him, but they are later replaced by the more real Antonina and Nadezhda who surround him. He turns perplexed, and is left as though awakening from a dream. The &ldquo;Allegro Moderato&rdquo; has Russian qualities to which the mature Nadezhda, in an authoritative solo of balances and turns, and the young Antonina, in her own brisk solo of rhythmic and directional changes, dance out character and classical steps and poses. The final &ldquo;Allegro Vivace&rdquo; is introduced by the corps in a linked and weaving dance. Peter dances before them jovially, Antonina dances to be encircled by part of the corps, and Nadezhda, too, surrounded by her own side. Peter brings both of them to his center spot and dances with them briefly, after which the corps seems to push them upstage like waves. With the complete corps of eight somehow screening them from the audience, Peter lifts Nadezhda while Antonina falls by his feet in a final tableau. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Taking an age-old and deeply rooted religious theme and one of the world&rsquo;s most beautiful hymns, she embarked on an interpretation that reflected her own ambiguities about national issues.Set against the huge cross with a halo-host at its center, the ballet develops movements that crystallize into symbolic visions of the Carrying of the Cross, the Crucifixion, the Pieta, and the Resurrection and Transfiguration of Jesus Christ. The spasmodic and angular movements vividly evoke Reyes&rsquo; inner anguish and turmoil as a Filipina beset by her country&rsquo;s ills.The result is a unique and refreshing dance interpretation of musical scores and hymns. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a> and Basilio Esteban S.

When the curtain rises, a woman (Protagonist) with fire designs on her body is caught alone in a weighted pose. She dances perturbed. Soon other dancers similarly costumed rush about and sustain her, but they all go away. The Protagonist then sees a Vision in a pas de trois. A woman soars over her two male partners. After a sharp solo and poses with her partners, she is again borne away. Another confident woman enters alone and is soon joined by a virile partner. Their pas de deux is framed by a corps de ballet. They all finally form a brief tableau and file out, the woman carried off by her man as the music diminishes in intensity. The Monologue of the Protagonist follows, a gliding yet weighted solo. To an introspective melody, she tests her sureness with balances, but often drops over sharply. Sadly, she goes to the floor, reaching and crying. This develops into extended and turning movements. As the music slackens, she glides away, reaching up and out. A birdlike allegro introduces two pairs for the Tetrad (or &ldquo;Of the Same Feathers&rdquo;) pas de quatre.In an adagio, they strike symmetrical and asymmetrical poses and sequences, sometimes expansive, sometimes contracted. They end quietly in a harmonious line, comforting one of the men. They go to separate places and bow, ready for the Epode (or &ldquo;Jubilation&rdquo;). This third movement starts with the two men&rsquo;s vigorous variations, followed by the two women&rsquo;s own sharp variations. Two other men and two other women join them to frame the Protagonist&rsquo;s crossing the stage, and continue their own driven dancing together. The women are all borne up and out. A corps de ballet enters gradually for a pas de six. The marked music brings back the four men. The complete cast now frames in various formations the Protagonist with whom they alternate steps or statements. She leaps over the men, who bring her up and down. Everyone moves to the music&rsquo;s increasing climaxes. All end around the Protagonist, who is hoisted by the men, even as she reaches out to the audience with her unappeased alienation and despair. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Moderndance in one act. Choreography, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2505\"><u><strong>EnricoLabayen</strong> </u></a>; libretto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2505\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2506\"><strong>Enrico Labayen</strong></a></strong></a>, based on a poem by AlfredA.Yuson; music, Shant Verdun; lighting design, KatschS.J.Catoy; set design, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\"><strong>Santiago Bose</strong></a>. Dancers: ConradDy-Liacco (Icarus); Wendy Panganiban (female sun); Perry Sevidal and Tina Fargas (satellites). Premiered by the Lab Projekt on 11 Apr 1991 at the Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\"><strong>Aurelio V. Tolentino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Labayen, this modern ballet in one scene depicts man&rsquo;s yearning for limitlessness by portraying Icarus&rsquo; ambition and the threat to his daring. It was inspired by Yuson&rsquo;s poem:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hanging, Poised on poisoned sense, essences dripping on his head, centered. Were the dancer</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do a cartwheel His figure would show</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the revealed arc as the Hanged Man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This man knows. He stays there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He falls. And His Falling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He knows. He knows he is falling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is falling. He has fallen</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story is deceptively simple. Icarus is ordained by two female satellite figures who come from suspended beams. This set of bamboo poles, strung horizontally together against a cyclorama of changing colors, dominates the whole ballet as an overhanging, swaying but predetermined sky. Even while on the ground, Icarus feels as if he is up in the clouds, riding a bicycle, and wearing a black helmet. The helmet is changed to a white one with a red crest. Icarus climbs despite the swaying of the bamboo and the risk of falling and kisses a female sun. He then rides a suspended bicycle, sculpts his moving body on the objective article, and climbs further up even above the sun. From there he falls. From rung to rung of bamboo beams, he seems to fall again and again, until he reaches the ground. As he falls, the bird sounds grow in intensity and end in silence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Icarus</em></strong> is an expanded form of Labayen&rsquo;s multigravitational art, which he does with ropes in <strong><em>Maya</em></strong> which is named after the Hindu measurer or law of polarity. Both ballets show and signify the risk of heights; the indeterminacy of movement while up above and the limitation of the same by the chosen setup; and the process from the mind, not simply from the senses. The dance plays with the idea of human ambition driven to doom. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

This was repeated in 1977 with additional choreography by Na&ntilde;as and Caringal, with dancers Rimpos and ReyDizon, or Na&ntilde;as and Froilan. In 1978, the same choreographic credits were shared, with Armin Wild, and the setting was Spanish Philippines, specifically, the house of a<em>presidente del municipio</em>(mayor).<em></em>The &ldquo;Snow Scene&rdquo; was called &ldquo;The Star Kingdom,&rdquo; the dances in Act 2 had Hispanized titles, and Mother Ginger (TonyEspejo) was indigenized as Se&ntilde;ora Bibingka. In 1980, Ballet Philippines presented Wild&rsquo;s European version, with the &ldquo;Waltz of the Flowers&rdquo; turned into the &ldquo;Waltz of the Seasons.&rdquo; The Sugarplum Fairy was Gina Mariano or Emellie Rigonan, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2627\"><strong>Sofia Zobel</strong></a> as Clara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1982, AliceReyes reset her version in the Philippines at the turn of the century. Through the character of Don Manolo (the Drosselmeyer role), she gave unity to the ballet and turned the flowers into Viennese dolls. Leading dancers were Leslie Brown and John Meehan, Maricar Drilon, and BrandoMiranda, or Na&ntilde;as and Froilan. In 1987, EdnaVida made her own version, renamed Clara&rsquo;s family, created a Don Alfonso Quintero (the Drosselmeyer), renamed the &ldquo;Snow Scene&rdquo; as &ldquo;Kingdom of the Fireflies,&rdquo; kept the dances in her Act III as doll dances, except for the &ldquo;Waltz of the Bougainvillas.&rdquo; The Sugarplum Fairy dancers were LisaMacuja, CecileSicangco, Gina Katigbak, Melissa Caachon or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2414\"><strong>Ida Beltran</strong></a>, while the Nutcracker prince were Froilan, Miranda, ConradDy-Liacco or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2522\"><strong>Jun Mabaquiao</strong></a>. Designers for sets and/or costumes of Ballet Philippines productions have been <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4892\"><strong>Johnny Manahan</strong></a>, Toto Sicangco, ArturoCruz, and SalvadorBernal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these versions stuck to the essential story of the girl Clara brought to the &ldquo;Kingdom of the Sweets&rdquo; (or of dolls) by either the Nutcracker transformed into a Prince or by her godfather (Drosselmeyer, Don Manolo, or Don Alfonso), or by both. The dream ends and Clara is brought back to real life and her family&rsquo;s home. The grand pas de deux is usually danced in the surviving Lev Ivanov version. However, in 1969, a Soviet group called the Grand Yunost Cultural Troupe danced what was probably a Vainonen version. This version was danced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2523\"><strong>Lisa Macuja</strong></a> in the Vaganova Choreographic Institute production; in Manila, she performed her variation from this version. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Choreography, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2621\"><u><strong>Basilio</strong> </u></a>; music, Ruben Federizon ( <strong><em>RitmosTabulare</em></strong> ), Joaquin Rodrigo ( <strong><em>Fantasia para un Gentil-hombre</em></strong> ),and Antonio Vivaldi ( <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a> in A minor for Piccolo</em></strong>,but played on a block-flute); lighting design, Raymond Salvacion; costumes, Raquel Rey (part 1) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2431\"><strong>Arturo Cruz</strong></a> (parts 2 and 3). The three sections representing Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, were developed separately. &ldquo;Mosque Baroque&rdquo; was premiered by DanceTheaterPhilippines (DTP) in Webster Memorial Theater, Arbroath, Scotland, on 6 Aug 1975; &ldquo;La Adoracion&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hidden Rites&rdquo; (to Samuel Barber&rsquo;s <strong><em>Adagio for Strings</em></strong> )by DTP and St. Theresa&rsquo;s College School of Dance in Meralco Theater, Pasig, on 4 Mar 1978.&ldquo;Hidden Rites&rdquo; was replaced by &ldquo;Paglalang&rdquo; (Creation, to the Federizon score), premiered by DTP (with parts 2 and 3) on 9 Sep 1983 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. Premiere cast of &ldquo;Paglalang&rdquo; had Regina Debuque and Jonathan Terry; &ldquo;Adoracion&rdquo; had Mary Anne Santamaria (La Dama), Joseph Ra&ntilde;ola (El Hidalgo), AnnaVilladolid alternating with Lida Abad Santos (La Zagala), Victor Madrona and Benjie Lintag alternating with Jose Lirio (Los Zagales); &ldquo;Mosque Baroque&rdquo; had <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2582\"><strong>Irene Sabas</strong></a> (Sultana) and Mitto Castillo (Sultan).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Paglalang&rdquo; (Creation) is about the first man and woman, Malakas and Maganda (Strong and Beautiful), in<em>pintado</em>(body tattoo) costuming. They are first revealed behind branches which they hold; they dance a subtle flirtation in solos and duets and come to final union in an embrace.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;La Adoracion&rdquo; (Adoration) is inspired by <strong>pandanggosailaw</strong> (pandanggo with light), but with only one lighted drinking glass in the hand or on the head for the women. It has accumulative movements in simple style, and features a pas de deux between La Dama and El Hidalgo amid lines of lights on the floor, a pas de trois among La Zagala and two<em>zagales</em>(young bachelors) that exploits lines and supple bends, and a lively <strong>jota</strong> for six women. As the ballet ends with everyone drifting away, it leaves the Hidalgo and the Dama with a single light on her head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Mosque Baroque&rdquo; is a series of dances in three movements, set off by a grand vinta sail. It is echoed by the Sultana&rsquo;s canopy of mat and<em>malong</em>(tubular garment). In this series of dances with the Sultana and her female attendants, and the Sultan and his male attendants, a slightly flirtatious pas de deux ends with the couple under an upraised canopy; a finale elaborates movements with the women&rsquo;s scarves. The ballet ends with everyone flailing their scarves or prancing about with ankle bells. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Concepcion Regalado, Kenneth Santos, Jorge Laico, and Jake Paquing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/202\"><strong>Vinta</strong></a></em></strong> is inspired by the Tausug sailboat of the same name. It has no story, nor does it realistically represent Tausug culture; instead, it explores the many ways of using multicolored cloths with patterns associated with the Tausug sailboat. The ballet opens with a breathtaking scene that emulates a vinta sailing across the ocean. Two long cloths stretch across the stage like colorful vinta sails. The first cloth is held up by nine women in a V-formation, the second by three men behind them. The lead female and male, performed by Lisa Macuja and Manuel Molina III, are at the center of this boat representation. The two act as the masthead, while the ensemble unfold their legs into high side extensions ( <strong>developpe ala seconde</strong> ) that then circle forward ( <strong>grand rond de jambe en dedans</strong> ) to mimic the paddling of oars that steer the vinta over the water. The following ensemble section breaks into two trios with elaborate partnering. The two female leads are smoothly transported across the stage by the male dancers, before the two main dancers come together in a visual climax. The second section feels like a denouement, with all the flags and colors, and a recap of roles before everyone returns to the cloth-shaped vinta<em>,</em>as if sailing for home.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The cloths form part of the scenography and are worn by the dancers who manipulate them as choreographic exploration. Performed <strong>en pointe</strong>, the piece showcases an extensive ballet vocabulary that serves as a basis for experimentations with the<em>malong</em>, a tubular cloth that serves several purposes. An iconic pose from <strong><em>Vinta</em></strong> is of the corps de ballet wearing the malong around their bodies, stretched out in a tilted parallelogram as the dancers bend forward with their back leg raised high in the air ( <strong>penche&eacute; en attitude</strong> ), and an arm each holding up a corner of the malong. The malong is also manipulated by sharply changing arm positions and swift turns, while the cloth is slung over on a shoulder. The balletic movements are &ldquo;Asianized&rdquo; by flexed hands and angular arms, shapes associated with dances from the Tausug, Maranao, and Maguindanao communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Vinta</em></strong> was regularly restaged in mixed bill productions. On tours, it offered an abstract visual showcase of Philippine culture. After Molina, Nicolas Paca&ntilde;a, Osias Barroso Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2409\"><strong>Raoul Banzon</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2493\"><strong>Quincy Jacinto</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2496\"><strong>Ronilo Jaynario</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2492\"><strong>Lucas Jacinto</strong></a>, and Marvin Ryan Arizo were cast as the male lead.

The musical score of Federizon, a composer who has been inspired by indigenous music, is an ethno-jazz polyphony rich in texture, and an excellent match for the physical and immediate movements of the ballet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Vision of</em></strong><strong><em>Fire</em></strong> is a modern dance piece in three sections based on the story of Adam and Eve. It begins with man in his basic innocence. Then he is tormented by woman&rsquo;s passion. The dance proceeds to dramatize their union in the primalstage, and the discovery of freedom, until passion locks them in a preordained destiny.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Vision of</em></strong><strong><em>Fire</em></strong> has since undergone considerable revisions. The first section of the ballet has metamorphosed from grounded pagan movements into surreal flowing mannerisms inspired by<em>tai-chi</em>.<em></em>The music has been edited and sections of the ballet shortened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Vision of</em></strong><strong><em>Fire</em></strong> was included in the company&rsquo;s repertoire for the 50th American Dance Festival in Durham, North Carolina, in Jun 1984 as a personal choice of festival director Charles Reinchart. An American critic described the ballet as one in which &ldquo;men and women whirl, reach and circle like flames in the cyclical pattern that builds in intensity, speed and complication &hellip; skirts catch color, dancers become half shadows of themselves, inhumanly beautiful.&rdquo; The ballet has also been performed in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, China, Germany, France, Japan, a few Southeast Asian countries, as well as various cities and provinces in the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Solo contemporary dance. Choreography and performance, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2560\"><u><strong>Rhosam Prudenciado Jr</strong> </u></a>; music, Wade Robson and Matmos. Premiered at the Outlet Yard in Dec 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally titled <strong><em>Possibility (Effects of Failure)</em></strong>, the choreography started off as a short competition piece in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2389\"><strong>Airdance Theater Inc.</strong></a>&rsquo;s Airdance Idol 3, an informal competition meant to encourage members to create new works. This first version was awarded third place. Later, Prudenciado developed it as an entry to the WiFi Body Dance Festival&rsquo;s New Choreographer&rsquo;s Competition in Jul 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/204\"><strong>Which Way?</strong></a></em></strong> is a narration of a person&rsquo;s struggles and choices&mdash;at a &ldquo;crossroad,&rdquo; as suggested by the constant repetition of that word in the music. The work starts with Prudenciado center stage, under a spotlight. He does a series of finger-pointing gestures as the thematic movement. The piece then narrates a dancer&rsquo;s struggle for direction, ending with his inability to decide on the path he should take. Based on Prudenciado&rsquo;s personal experiences, this piece also exemplifies his creative process, which requires multiple revisions. It has proved to be a constant crowd favourite for its organic and fluid movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an eight-minute piece, <strong><em>Which Way?</em></strong> won second prize at the <strong><em>WiFi Body Festival</em></strong>. For the Yokohama Solo x Duo + competition of the Yokohama Dance Collection R in 2009, it was further expanded to 14 minutes, incorporating a video by Prudenciado and Crispin Urbanozo III, with lighting design by Sueyen Austero, and editing by Jordan Arabejo. It won for the choreographer the grand prize in Yokohoma and a six-month dance residency in France, where it was restaged for Theatre Darius Milhaud in 2009. Thereafter, it was restaged for festivals including mc2 (dance = musicconstructed2) in Manila in 2009; WiFi Body Dance Festival in 2009; and the 11th International Festival in Korea, also in 2009. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\"><strong>Chant</strong></a>al Primero</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The prologue reveals Goyesca figures of<em>duende</em>(dwarves) and<em>encantada</em>(enchantress), devout and devilish, some of them creatures with sagging bloody bosoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Act 1 shows Yerma and Juan yearning for an absent passion, for an unborn child. Victor comes to bid goodbye, his desire resisted because of society&rsquo;s<em>punto de honor</em>(point of honor). Act 2 brings Yerma to the field of Granada where men and women give vent to their passion while old women pray. Yerma bitterly realizes the cause of her barrenness, then dances with a horned image of Victor. Act 3 brings Yerma to the mountains for a fertility rite. Shocking and entrancing; she lures Juan and awakens the sensual in him. But the possessed Yerma eventually strangles Juan, forever stifling her womb, but at the same time liberating herself forever. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

A much revised version was rechoreographed by Borromeo in 1979 for DTP&rsquo;s tour of England and Scotland in the course of the 11th International Festival of Youth Orchestras and Performing Arts.

This ballet presents the milieu of the social life during the era of Spanish colonization with male and female group dances and three featured pas de deux. The<em>zagalas</em>(young maidens)wear stylized versions of national costumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1979 version retains the dances of the corps (<em>entrada</em>)and the respective dances for the male and female corps members, but these are now more elaborately patterned. In the same manner, the old pas de deuxes are changed: the first one becomes a pas de quatre with three zagalas and one zagala often lifted spectacularly; the second, to the melodious &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a>sdeCapiz&rdquo; (Memories of Capiz), is disarmingly simple with its nostalgic gestures and alternating solos; the third pas de deux is brisk and virtuosic, leading to the company coda. To the original fans of the corps, there are added scarves that form interesting patterns. Its balletic style and native flavoring are evocative of the era&rsquo;s dance styles including the polka, valse, and other Spanishdances that have become &ldquo;Filipinized.&rdquo;Some essential characteristics of Philippine dances are highly visible in the fusion of ballet steps with the sway and sweep of arms and the gestures culled from folkdances. The peculiar coyness of the Filipina female of that period shines through, as does the male&rsquo;s gentle gallantry. Hands and arms are forever communicating as the male and female dancers seem to be playing ritualistic games of shy love. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.
