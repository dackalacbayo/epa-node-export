Dancer, teacher, choreographer. She was a Polish woman who first came to the Philippines in 1922 as a member of Anna Pavlova&rsquo;s company. She settled in Manila in 1927, and with her manager-impresario G. Leibovitz and pianist Ivan Sitnik, she set up the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2430\"><strong>Cosmopolitan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> and Dancing School</strong></a> on San Marcelino Street in Manila.

Also among her pupils were Mitos Sison, Cecile Yulo, Mita Pardo de Tavera, Helen McMicking, and the Perfecto sisters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She taught many international character dances, then very much a part of ballet theater presentations. Annually she took a theme&mdash;a nature motif or a geographical focus, like the fad for pseudo-orientalism&mdash;for her recitals. Later this approach was followed by her pupils in their own school recitals. She also initiated the balletic stylization of Filipino dances, presenting dances in<em>maria clara</em>(upper-class gown of the 1880s) and regional costumes, as in <strong><em>Planting Rice</em></strong> and <strong><em>Cari&ntilde;osa</em></strong> (Loveable).Aside from venues like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\"><strong>Manila Grand <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> House</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a> was a center of her annual recitals before World War II.

Bacolod 2 May 1982. Painter, choreographer, director. He was the son of Leon Conde Ayco and Encarnacion Ramos. He adopted an artistic name ( <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3383\"><strong>Jess Aiko</strong></a></strong> </strong> ) in 1967. He obtained his early schooling at Ateneo de Manila. He took courses in painting at the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts in 1935-36. He also studied architecture at the University of Santo Tomas. He traveled to Europe and studied in London and Paris for some time. He held his first one-person show at the Philippine Art Gallery in May 1956, which was followed by group and solo shows in Bacolod, Cebu, Iloilo, and Dumaguete cities. In his shows, he displayed an avant-garde sensibility borne out by his experiments in enamel and tempera. He was instrumental in the formation of the Art Association of Bacolod. He lived in Bacolod City for most of his life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Well-traveled and well-read, Ayco witnessed the vigor of abstract painting in Paris. His canvases were covered with splatterings of enamel paint. The density and tensility of his medium became the very subject of his paintings. An early work of Ayco, <b><i>Young Widow by the Church</i></b>, 1947, showed his expressionistic tendency, quite advanced for the period in the context of Philippine art history. However, he also used the patterns formed by the medium to evoke shapes derived from life as in <b><i>Sylvan Idyll</i></b>, 1956.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ayco designed for dance and drama presentations, and choreographed dances in Bacolod, Iloilo, and Cebu. He was involved in the Kayumanggi FolkDance Troupe from the 1950s through the 1960s, the Negros Occidental Dance Troupe (NODT) in the 1970s, and in the KaanyagPilipinasDance<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, formerly the West Negros College Dance Company, in the 1980s. As artistic director of the NODT, he worked with dance directors Elsie Yelo-Enriquez and Virgie Gallespen. Under his direction, they strung together Philippine folk dances into theatrical programs like <b><i>The Lost Earring </i></b>and <b><i>Fiesta</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which included another original treatment of AlejandroRoces&rsquo;s story &ldquo;The Cockfight.&rdquo; In 1965, he staged <b><i>Scintilla</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which fused Philippine folklore, stories, music, and choreography, and in 1966, the dance drama <b><i>Igpat sang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/524\"><strong>Bulawan</strong></a> </i></b>(Glow of Gold), about the barter of Negros and Panay that antedated the <b><i>Dularawan: Salakot na Ginto </i></b>(Image Play: Golden Salakot) in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He was also involved with Visayan theater groups in plays and musicals. He staged <b><i>Oklahoma </i></b>in Bacolod, <b><i>The Sound of Music </i></b>and <b><i>Carousel </i></b>in Iloilo, and <b><i>The King and I</i></b> in Cebu. He produced and directed <b><i>Medea </i></b>and Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1277\"><strong>Salome</strong></a></i></b>, among others. He also designed for most of the dance productions of Bacolod&rsquo;s choreographer LydiaMadarang-Gaston, and for the first Asian tour of the BaranggayFolkDanceTroupe in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Biolastparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aiko won the following prizes in the Art Association of the Philippines art competition: honorable mention in photography,<b><i> Pitang</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1952; second prize in non-objective painting, <b><i>Anterean Dance</i></b>, 1958; and second prize in non-objective painting, <b><i>Plutonian Passage</i></b>, 1962.  <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by  <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3719\"><strong>Santiago A.

The first Board of Trustees was composed of the founding members with the inclusion of Basilio Esteban Villaruz, Elmer del Rosario, Grace F. Amilbangsa, and Dalisay F. Lumba. In 2009, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5308\"><strong>Mariel N. Francisco</strong></a> and Pacita C. Gavino joined the board.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Alun-alun</em>, meaning &ldquo;gentle wave,&rdquo; characterizes the flowing, undulating movements of pangalay and its variants, as researched by Amilbangsa since 1969. Also known as <strong>igal</strong> among the Sama and <strong>pamansak</strong> / <strong>pansak</strong> among the Yakan, it is the dominant indigenous dance form of the Sulu Archipelago, antedating Islam and Christianity in the Philippines. The ADC combines preservation with innovation and experimentation. Its repertoire consists of traditional pangalay choreography as well as creative pieces accompanied by pop, classical, rock, and folk music and poetry. ADC has staged performances in formal and informal venues in Manila and the provinces. <strong><em>Stillness in Motion</em></strong>,2000,the first major choreography of Fernando Amilbangsa, utilized puppets and masks to the avant-garde composition of Isha Abubakar. <strong><em>Bangko ni Billy</em></strong> (Billy&rsquo;s Bench), 2002, featured the sculptured bench of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\"><strong>Napoleon Abueva</strong></a> and the novelty songs of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a>. Other performances include <strong><em>Pangalay at Musika ng Bayan</em></strong> (Pangalay and Music of the Nation),2010; <strong><em>Alay sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan</em></strong> (In Praise of Freedom), 2011; <strong><em>Konsiyerto ng Pangalay</em></strong>, <strong><em>Tula</em></strong>, <strong><em>Salinawit at Musika</em></strong> (Pangalay Concert in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\"><strong>Poetry</strong></a>, Adapted Songs and Music), 2011 ; <strong><em>Alay sa Kababaihan</em></strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>te to Women), 2012; <strong><em>Alay sa Kalikasan</em></strong> (An Offering to Nature), 2012; <strong><em>Dance, Music, and Prayer for Mother Earth</em></strong>, 2012; <strong><em>Celebrating Eid&rsquo;l Fitr through Dance</em></strong>, 2012; and <strong><em>Pangalay and Icons of Philippine Culture</em></strong>, 2013.

It propagates pangalay through the Amilbangsa Instruction Method (AIM) based on the breath and nonlinear rhythm common to Asian movement disciplines. Weekly training sessions at the ADC studio in Antipolo City have made pangalay accessible to researchers, filmmakers, choreographers, dancers, and dance students. On the other hand, their outreach training has introduced pangalay to public school teachers of Pontevedra, Negros Occidental; theater artists of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a> Talyer, Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA), and PETA-Metropolitan Teen Theater League; members of Kaloob Philippine Dance Ministry; students of Emilio Aguinaldo College; and overseas Filipinos sponsored by the Philippine embassy in Paris. In 2008, the workshop for the Punta Cruz Cultural Collective in Maribojoc, Bohol, culminated in <strong><em>Tawag sa Bantawan</em></strong> (Call of the Watch Tower), a dance drama depicting the heroic struggles behind the Punta Cruz Watch Tower. A pilot project at Manila Boys Town in 2012 culminated in <strong><em>Pangalay sa Manila Boys&rsquo; Town</em></strong> (Pangalay at Manila Boys&rsquo; Town) performed by resident children and seniors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2007 ADC convened the International Conference on the Conservation and Popularization of Pangalay and Related Asian Dance Cultures in Metro Manila. Filipino academicians, teachers, cultural workers, dancers, and choreographers interacted with colleagues from Cambodia, Thailand, Japan, United States, Indonesia, and Malaysia. In 2009, a dance exchange workshop between ADC and Indonesian dancers marked the 60th anniversary of Indonesia-Philippine bilateral relations. At the 4th Asian Performing Arts Festival in Taipei in 2006, the ADC presented two full-length shows, <strong><em>Offering</em></strong> and <strong><em>Shoeperb-Superb!</em></strong> For the 60th anniversary of Franco-Philippine relations in 2007, the ADC held a series of performances in Paris. In 2009, the Philippine ambassador to Vietnam hosted the ADC&rsquo;s performance at the vin d&rsquo;honneur for the 111th Philippine Independence Day in Hanoi. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Ma.

San Juan, Rizal 9 Oct 1943. Scholar, choreographer, dancer, teacher, cultural heritage conservationist.The daughter of Gil Estanislao Fernando, former mayor of Marikina, and Remedios Constantino Flores, a businesswoman. She is the mother of Dayangdayang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2736\"><strong>Grace Amilbangsa</strong></a> who was a dancer, stage and film artist, and later a child development teacher in the USA; and Datu Gil Amilbangsa who is an industrial engineer and president of an international steel building company. She graduated in 1963 with a bachelor of arts degree in English from Far Eastern University (FEU). After she married her schoolmate Datu Punjungan Amilbangsa in 1964, she moved with him to the Sulu Archipelago where she first saw the dance called <strong>pangalay</strong> aka <strong>igal</strong>, a pre-Islamic dance tradition among the ethnic groups in Southern Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Captivated by pangalay, Fernando Amilbangsa began researching not only on the dance but also on related fields such as music, architecture, and visual arts of the Sama and Sama Dilaut (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a>), Jama Mapun, and Tausug. Her groundbreaking work is the documentation, deconstruction, and codification of the pangalay/igal dance style, also known as <strong>pamansak</strong> among the Yakan. Aside from pangalay, she also documented two other dance traditions: the <strong>langka</strong> style, a martial dance tradition, and the <strong>lunsay</strong>, a song-dance tradition. She was also the first to record and translate the ritual dances of the Sulu Archipelago into choreographic works. Her decades of research led her to conclude that these dances are linked to the classical dance traditions of Southeast Asia. As a dance teacher, she devised a formal method of instruction called the Amilbangsa Instruction Method (AIM), which allows children and seniors to learn the dance in a scientific and systematic way. The AIM ensures the transmission of the dance form with fidelity to tradition. In 1983, she published <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/15\"><strong>Pangalay: Traditional Dances and Related Folk Artistic Expressions</strong></a></em></strong>, which won the Best Art Book award from the ManilaCriticsCircle. Her second book, titled <strong><em>Ukkil: Visual Arts of the Sulu Archipelago</em></strong>, was published in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from doing research, she actively promoted Tawi-Tawi&rsquo;s rich culture. In 1974, she founded and became the first president of the Tawi-Tawi Cultural and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1066\"><strong>Historical</strong></a> Society. In the same year, she organized the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2604\"><strong>Tambuli Cultural Troupe</strong></a>, the first dance group in the province, which she directed until 1978. She became a consultant for a film documentary on the Sama Dilaut (Badjao) in 1975, and initiated and administered the First Tawi-Tawi Arts and Crafts Exhibit in 1976 through the Mindanao State University (MSU), Sulu College of Technology and Oceanography, and the Tawi-Tawi provincial government. From 1977 to 1987, she was the movement consultant and guest artist of the Philippine Educational Theater Association. In 1978, she organized the Integrated Performing Arts Guild at the MSU-Iligan Institute of Technology in Lanao del Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fernando Amilbangsa&rsquo;s return to Manila did not extinguish her enthusiasm for the work that she began. In 1992, she staged the pangalay and lunsaydances for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2488\"><strong>Hwa Yi Ethnic Dance Center</strong></a>. Then in 1999, she cofounded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2394\"><strong>AlunAlun Dance Circle</strong></a>, which aims to promote pangalay through performances, comprehensive dance training, and research.She has been the dance troupe&rsquo;s artistic director since then. She is a member of the Tawi-Tawi Cultural and Historical Society, Marikina Valley Heritage Foundation, Philippine Association of Museums, Cultural Planners Association of the Philippines, Philippine Council for Culture and the Arts, Kasibulan (Women Artists&rsquo; Group of the Philippines), and the Asian Dance Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her dedication to preserve the dances and allied arts of the Sulu Archipelago has been richly rewarded. A leader in cultural research and development, she has been cited by numerous local and international institutions, including the Asian Dance Alliance for the International Dance Festival at the 24th Seoul Olympics, 1988, and the UNESCO, 1989. Her pangalay choreography won the silver award in the folk dance category at the International Dance Competition in Seoul in 1994. Distinctions in 1994 were the FEU Green and Gold Artist Award for dance, the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan for Dance Research on the 423rd Foundation Anniversary of the City of Manila, and the Ginintuang Parangal sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a> ng Marikina.

Choreographer, teacher. An Italian, Appiani taught European dances in Manila from the mid-1800s. He formed the Compa&ntilde;ia Infantil de Baile, which performed in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>Teatro</strong></a>deBinondo, providing intermission numbers for the Compa&ntilde;ia de Teatro del Valon of Manuel Lopez de Ariza in the Teatro de Tondo, and in the 1850s, in the Teatrito de Sibacon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first he taught ballroom dancing routines, among them <strong>quadrilles</strong>, like the <strong>gavotte</strong> and <strong>rigodon</strong> or <strong>rigaudon</strong>, the <strong>redova</strong> and the <strong>schottische</strong>, and character dances like the Polish <strong>cracovienne</strong> or <strong>krakowiak</strong>. He established a dance school where he taught, for free, young pupils who later joined his company. It was said that he knew fully the techniques and theories of dance and theater. Among the numbers or ballets he choreographed were <strong><em>El Cornetin y la Grizeta</em></strong>, <strong><em>El Paso Stirio</em></strong>, <strong><em>El Sargento Marco Bamba</em></strong>, and his most successful finale, <strong><em>La Mariposa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong>, for which he received a long standing ovation. It was said that his productions could run from 20 to 30 performances, and these were with plots developed into acts and provided scenic designs by the reputable <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3633\"><strong>Jose Honorato Lozano</strong></a>. Unfortunately, Teatro Sibacon collapsed in 1853, a few hours after a performance. Because of ill health and &ldquo;due to some insidious grief encountered in the country,&rdquo; Appiani returned to Spain. Some years after, he was reported to be running a dance company in Granada, headed by the celebrated Pitteri, &ldquo;Queen of the Wind.&rdquo; Atayde (1982) acknowledged Appiani&rsquo;s great and as yet unprecedented contribution of sowing &ldquo;the seed of choreographic art,&rdquo; after which &ldquo;his students became the comic, lyric, and choreographic artists of Philippine theater.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span> <em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

It was a dream of businessman J. Amado Araneta who envisioned the group to serve as an exchange program for professional folk dancers. After a month of auditions, it was organized by Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo with 50 members. Most of its principal dancers were from established dance companies, such as the Baranggay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Troupe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Philippine Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, University of the Philippines Filipiniana Dance Troupe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2405\"><strong>Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a></strong></a> Company (later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2486\"><strong>Hariraya Ballet Company</strong></a>), Pamana Ballet (of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2503\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Kane</strong></a>), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2600\"><strong>Studio Dance Group</strong></a> (of Ricardo and Roberta Cassell), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a> House Dancers, and the Far Eastern University and University of the East dance groups. Many of these dancers joined the company, wishing to explore other possibilities for movement expression after ballet was banned by the Roman Catholic hierarchy in 1955. The ACDG was acknowledged as the first professional and legitimate dance theater group. (Previously, professional dancers were with the <strong>bodabil</strong> of the Opera House and Clover Theater.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its inaugural show, highly applauded were <strong><em>The</em></strong><strong><em>Muslim</em></strong>,a suite of Mindanao dances like &ldquo;Kuntao Silat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Pangalay,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tiruray,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kapiil sa Munsala,&rdquo; and the finale, the &ldquo;Planting Rice Suite.&rdquo; In the second production with the Zugspitz Artisten, a company of 20 German acrobats, the group danced a Bavarian folk dance together with a suite of Spanish-influenced dances, staged arena style. This format was continued in <strong><em>Pageant of World Beauties</em></strong> with &ldquo;Binasuan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bali-Hai,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Show Business.&rdquo; The group later veered toward dances in Western theme and style. When Generoso-I&ntilde;igo moved to Davao, the Coliseum staged dances with other director-choreographers (notably, Alcuin Pastrana aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2563\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Al Quinn</strong></a></strong></a>) on a contractual basis.

Cruz as adviser and artistic director. The other dancers in the core were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2401\"><strong>Pamela Asprer</strong></a>, Kristin Dabao, Ianne Damian, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2438\"><strong>Elline Damian</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2477\"><strong>Aileen Gallinera</strong></a>, Sandralynn Huang, Eileen Lopez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2458\"><strong>Eduardo Espejo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2459\"><strong>Jeffrey Espejo</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2538\"><strong>Christopher Mohnani</strong></a>. The company&rsquo;s mission is to promote ballet among the people and to bring mass audiences to appreciate the art form. BM&rsquo;s principal ballerina, Lisa Macuja, is the moving force behind the company, especially during its formative years when she functioned as ballet teacher, associate artistic director, and business manager, among other tasks. In keeping with its avowed mission of popularizing the classical dance form, BM during its first year completed 71 performances in the Philippines, including 16 shows in Russia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The training and education curriculum of the group is based on the method of the Vaganova Choreographic School which later became known as Russian Academy of Dance. In the next two decades since its establishment, BM grew to become a professional company with a corps of 65 artists. The regular venue of its performances is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Theater located beside the Manila Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> and Star City in Pasay City. BM has mounted classics like <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong>, <strong><em>Don Quixote</em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/199\"><strong>The Nutcracker</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em>La Bayadere</em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/185\"><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em>Carmen</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Le Corsaire</em></strong>. Contemporary dance pieces were also part of BM&rsquo;s repertoire, created by leading dance choreographers such as Bam Damian for <strong><em>Reconfigured</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\"><strong>Agnes Locsin</strong></a> for <strong><em>Arachnida</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2526\"><strong>Ernest Mandap</strong></a> for <strong><em>Reve</em></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2539\"><strong>Manuel Molina</strong></a> for <strong><em>Love Beyond Goodbye</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To continue its mission of bringing ballet closer to the masses, BM has produced original Filipino works such as <strong><em>Tatlong Kuwento ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Basyang</em></strong>, 2009. The success of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>&rsquo;s stories for children rendered in ballet led to the production of <strong><em>Tatlo Pang Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</em></strong> in 2013 with radio personality <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4830\"><strong>Luz Fernandez</strong></a> as Lola Basyang. The successful Lola Basyang shows enjoyed repeat performances in succeeding years. Another original ballet was Ed Maranan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Alamat: Si Sibol at Si Gunaw</em></strong> premiered in 2009. BM coproduced a concert series titled <strong><em>Ballet and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\"><strong>Ballad</strong></a>s</em></strong> with Manila Broadcasting Company. The show which combined pop music with classical ballet was shown in schools and venues within and outside Metro Manila. BM also implemented an effective strategy to endear ballet to the masses with Star City&rsquo;s free ballet shows for park-goers on weekends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, BM launched a dance scholarship program called Project Ballet Futures<em></em>(PBF) that offers free ballet training to deserving public school students. The training has a nutritional component to prepare potential ballerinas and danseurs for the intense mental and physical regimen of the Vaganova syllabus. To date, PBF has been training 25 dancers from the Philippine Christian Foundation in Tondo and public schools in Pasay City, Makati City, and Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1995, BM dancers joined international ballet competitions such as the Asia Pacific International Ballet Competitions, the Helsinki International Ballet Competition, the Beijing International Ballet Competition, and the Asian Grand Prix IBC. The participants to these competitions reached the semi-finals or finals, and some even gained medals of honor. BM was awarded Best Classical Dance Company by the Aliw Awards from 2012 to 2014. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rosalie S. Matilac</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

In 1970, Reyes worked with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2455\"><strong>Eddie Elejar</strong></a> and they both expanded it into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) Workshop and Company. The company was renamed the CCP Dance Company in 1974, and finally as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a> (BP) in 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning from the United States in 1969, Alice Reyes proposed a modern dance concert to CCP president Jaime Zobel de Ayala and artistic director Lucrecia Kasilag. It was produced on 19 and 21 Feb 1970 at the CCP Main Theater (now Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\"><strong>Nicanor Abelardo</strong></a>), with 16 members including Reyes as artistic director. After its Manila performance, the company toured the provinces, initiating its outreach program. In Jun 1971, Reyes and Elejar organized the first CCP summer dance workshop. Its success encouraged them to form a small but full-fledged dance company. With the help of Ma. Teresa Escoda-Roxas and Sixto Roxas of the Bancom Development Corporation, the CCP Dance Workshop and Company acquired a management staff and an artistic staff. Shortly thereafter, the CCP Dance School was also established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also in 1974, BP became the CCP&rsquo;s first resident dance company, receiving an annual partial subsidy and the free use of CCP facilities. The CCP Dance Foundation, now the BP Foundation, was set up to provide a more solid financial and organizational base, with Reyes as its first president in 1977, succeeded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2495\"><strong>Nestor Jardin</strong></a> in 1989 and Maan Hontiveros in 1993. The foundation&rsquo;s chairpersons were Jaime Zobel de Ayala, Bea Zobel, Escoda-Roxas, Ching Montinola, Ernest Escaler, and Antonio Cojuangco Jr. Its programs included the CCP Dance School, the summer dance workshop, outreach program, BP II, the scholarship program, the Society for BP, the Friends of BP International, and the School Parents Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1983, the company formed BP II, headed by resident choreographer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\"><strong>Agnes Locsin</strong></a>. Composed of young and talented scholars and company apprentices, the junior group&rsquo;s mandate included training young talents for the main company, developing new works, and performing the company&rsquo;s repertoire pieces not presented in the season through touring programs, lecture-demonstrations, and workshops. To date, the group has had numerous provincial workshops and special performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BP&rsquo;s summer dance workshops continue to invite dance teachers and choreographers from all over the world. The roster includes: Norman Walker, Pauline Koner, Alfred Rodrigues, Mikhail Kukharev, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2542\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Morgan</strong></a>, Armin Wild, Luminita Dumitrescu, and Vakhtang Chabukiani. Aside from developing the technical and artistic proficiency of the dancers, they also expanded the company repertoire with works performed by major companies. Among these are Koner&rsquo;s <strong><em>Concertina</em></strong>, Doris Humphrey&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Shakers</em></strong>, Walker&rsquo;s <strong><em>Songs of a Wayfarer</em></strong>, Balanchine&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pas de Dix</em></strong>, and the ballet classics such as <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/199\"><strong>The Nutcracker</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em>The Sleeping Beauty</em></strong>, <strong><em>Don Quixote</em></strong>, <strong><em>La Bayadere</em></strong> (The Temple Dancer), <strong><em>Paquita</em></strong>, <strong><em>Raymonda Variations</em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em>Coppelia</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Firebird</em></strong>, <strong><em>Le Carnaval</em></strong>, <strong><em>Les Sylphides</em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/185\"><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></a></em></strong>, and <strong><em>Napoli Act III</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For six years, ballet master William Morgan helped in the technical progress of the dancers and the acquisition of a large classical repertory. BP&rsquo;s rootedness in the classical dance discipline, while making statements in modern dance, developed artists who became principal dancers abroad. Among them are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2539\"><strong>Manuel Molina</strong></a> who was with Ballet Nuevo Mundo in Venezuela, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2451\"><strong>Rey Dizon</strong></a> with Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2577\"><strong>Elizabeth Roxas</strong></a> with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Those who chose to stay, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2573\"><strong>Ester Rimpos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2473\"><strong>Nonoy Froilan</strong></a>, Effie Na&ntilde;as, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2593\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2594\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2595\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2596\"><strong>Cecile Sicangco</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> were likewise accorded the same distinction. Leading choreographers such as Elejar, Basilio, Locsin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2462\"><strong>Tony Fabella</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\"><strong>Denisa Reyes</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2422\"><strong>Gener Caringal</strong></a>, Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2537\"><strong>Brando Miranda</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2581\"><strong>Hazel Sabas</strong></a> enjoyed support to develop a unique Filipino dance expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company also welcomed as guests noted Filipino dancers abroad: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2410\"><strong>Maniya Barredo</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2590\"><strong>Tina Santos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2618\"><strong>Anna Villadolid</strong></a>, Andre Reyes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2505\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2506\"><strong>Enrico Labayen</strong></a></strong></a>, gracing the stage with such notables as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2523\"><strong>Lisa Macuja</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2482\"><strong>Toni Lopez Gonzalez</strong></a>. The reputation of the company is also evident in the number of foreign stars it has attracted, most notably Dame Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev, Alicia Alonso, Natalia Makarova, Fernando Bujones, Yoko Morishita, and Julio Bocca.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest contribution of the company to Philippine dance is its collaboration with various Filipino artists. Leading composers were commissioned to create musical spectacles based on Filipino folklore and legends. The company also presented a series of tributes to dance pioneers and choreographers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\"><strong>Francisca Reyes-Aquino</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2535\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2536\"><strong>Rosalia Merino-Santos</strong></a></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a>, Remedios de Oteyza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2418\"><strong>Julie Borromeo</strong></a>, Felicitas Layag-Radaic, Inday Gaston-Ma&ntilde;osa, Alice Reyes, and Froilan.

Tiongson</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company also provided training for its administrative and artistic staff. Starting out as performing artists, Denisa Reyes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2499\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2500\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2501\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2502\"><strong>Noordin Jumalon</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, Cecile Manikan, Jardin, Sicangco, and Vida rose to leadership while still pursuing the vision of its founders. Artistic director emeritus Alice Reyes directed the company from 1969 to 1991, with Elejar as codirector from 1969 to 1976, and Vida as associate artistic director in 1983. From 1991 to 1994, Denisa Reyes was the artistic director, with Sicangco as associate director; Reyes became artistic director again from 2000 to 2004. Sicangco took over from 1996 to 1999, followed by Jumalon from 1999 to 2000, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\"><strong>Alden Lugnasin</strong></a> in 2004, Augustus Damian III from 2004 to 2008, Alan Hineline and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2521\"><strong>Max Luna</strong></a> III from 2008 to 2009, and Paul Alexander <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es from 2009 to the present. Through time, Jardin served as company manager, administrator, and president. Salvador Bernal was the company&rsquo;s resident production designer since 1973, and served as its artistic consultant as well. Rudy Vidad, who had been with the company since its inception, served in numerous capacities as photographer, archivist, researcher, and artistic consultant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972, the company went on its first international tour to London and Spain, reaping accolades for its repertory that combined American modern dance and Philippine traditions. In 1974, BP toured Australia and Southeast Asia, making the same strong impression with what was becoming the company&rsquo;s hallmark&mdash;the definition of Filipino culture through dance with the use of Western forms and technique. Succeeding tours were to Germany, 1975; Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the United States Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow Dance Festival, 1977, and the American Dance Festival, 1984; the USSR, France, and Italy, 1978; Taiwan and Hong Kong, 1979; the USSR, Taiwan, Greece, Germany, 1980; Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia, 1981; Taiwan, 1982; Venezuela and Thailand, 1983; China, Germany, 1985; USSR, Indonesia, Czechoslovakia, and Singapore, 1988; Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan, 1989; Hong Kong, 1990; Spain, Germany, and India, 1992; Japan, 1993; Australia, 1995; Singapore, Indonesia, and China, 1997; Germany, Portugal, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, and United States, 1998. The group also participated in several international dance festivals, such as the &ldquo;Rencontre Internationale de la Danse&rdquo; in La Baule, France, in 1990 and 1992; the 1989 International Festival of Dance Academies in Hong Kong; the 1st Asian Arts Mart, Singapore, 2001; Festival of ASEAN Culture, Angkor Wat, Siem Riep, Cambodia, 2002; the 6th Asian Arts Festival, China and Nanning Folksong Arts Festival, China, 2004; World Expo, Aichi, Japan, 2005; and the World Expo, Shanghai, China, 2010. These tours provided the opportunity for foreign audiences to evaluate Asian dancing at par with its Western counterparts, but speaking a language of dance that was uniquely Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among BP&rsquo;s awards are: Best Dance Group, 2005; Outstanding Dance Production, Gawad Buhay, 2008 for <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/160\"><strong>La Revolucion Filipina</strong></a></em></strong> (The Philippine Revolution); Gawad Tanglaw Lifetime Achievement Award, 2008; Outstanding Dance Production, Gawad Buhay, 2009 for <strong><em>Masterworks</em></strong>; Outstanding Ensemble Performance in a Dance Production, Gawad Buhay, 2009 for <strong><em>Masterworks</em></strong>; Outstanding Ensemble Performance in a Dance Production, 2010, for <strong><em>Peter Pan</em></strong>; Best Dance Group (Contemporary Category) NCCA National Dance Competition, 2011; Outstanding Modern Dance Production and Outstanding Ensemble Performance for Dance, Gawad Buhay, 2012, for <strong><em>Rama, Hari</em></strong> (Rama, King). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Edna Vida, with notes from Rosa Concepcion Ladrido</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

		"text": "<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BAYANIHAN PHILIPPINE NATIONAL FOLK DANCE COMPANY</strong> Founded in 1957, the company started from the pioneering efforts at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University&rsquo;s (PWU) Filipiniana folk music and dance committee of the 1930s to collect and preserve Philippine folk dances, music, and costumes. In 1954, PWU sent a group to the Asian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Festival in Dacca, East Pakistan. It was headed by Dean Lucrecia Kasilag and included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a>, Violeta Bediones, Lourdes Villaflor, Celia Martinez, Ester Cornejo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2569\"><strong>Ricardo Reyes</strong></a>, and Castro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\"><strong>Palacio</strong></a>. This experience spurred further field research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Take it from the people&rdquo; became the PWU researchers&rsquo; guiding principle as they braved forbidding terrain, bad weather, and austere living conditions in their search for authentic dances, music, and costumes. Various parts of the country were scoured for years by Kasilag, Urtula, and Isabel Santos. Their work became the basis for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han&rsquo;s choreography which adapted ethnic and folk dances to the conventions and demands of theater. It provided materials for regular recitals by PWU&rsquo;s Physical Education Club, organized by Leticia de Guzman and Urtula, and led by Victoria de Guzman and Henrietta Hofer. The club gave its first major performance at a joint celebration of civic organizations in Oct 1956, with the theme &ldquo;Magbayanihan Tayo&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Help Each Other) suggested by Helena Benitez. In Feb 1957, the club presented <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a>: Philippine Music and Dance Festival</em></strong> before delegates to the World Confederation of Organizations of the Teaching Professions&rsquo; meeting in Manila. The Bayanihan Folk Arts Center was formally organized soon after, and in Sep 1957, it started giving monthly recitals for tourists and foreign missions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bayanihan&rsquo;s first major theater production, <strong><em>Glimpses of Philippine Culture</em></strong>, was at the Brussels Universal Exposition in 1958. It was an astounding success. Immediately after, it was invited to appear on Ed Sullivan&rsquo;s TV show in the United States, followed by tours of America and Europe. It was the first Philippine dance company to perform on Broadway, New York City, and in international stages. In 1959, its performance at the Winter Garden Theater in New York City was met by a standing ovation. The same year it won the critics&rsquo; award for folk ensemble at the Fete des Nations in Paris. For more than 50 years, Bayanihan has unfolded before the Filipinos and the world, the beauty of Philippine culture. It has not only preserved but also ensured the creative growth of ethnic culture. Artists who have worked with Bayanihan as dancers are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\"><strong>Alice Reyes</strong></a>, Ramon Obusan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2455\"><strong>Eddie Elejar</strong></a>, Antonio Fabella, Robert Tongko,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2420\"><strong>Rose Borromeo</strong></a></strong>, Hannah Gomez Trinidad, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2421\"><strong>Lito Calzado</strong></a>, and Rosky Balajadia. Other artists who designed for Bayanihan are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3039\"><strong>Jose Lardizabal</strong></a>, Leandro Locsin, Rodrigo Perez III, Teddy Hilado, Monino Duque, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2971\"><strong>Jun Gomez</strong></a>. Its second-generation directors include Suzie Benitez, executive director; Ferdinand Jose, dance director and choreographer; and Melito Vale Cruz, music director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1965, Bayanihan received the Ramon Magsaysay Award. In 1998, Republic Act No. 8626 designated the Bayanihan Philippine Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> the national folk dance company of the country. The following year, May 27 of every year was declared Bayanihan Day. The company started joining world dance competitions in 2002. In 2005, it participated in the 60th Sagra del Mandorlo in Fiore and the 50th International Festival del Folklore in Agrigento, Sicily, where it won the Golden Anniversary Gold Temple Award. Two years after, it won the grand prize and best in choreography award in the same festival with their dance narrative, <strong><em>The Voyage for Love and Peace</em></strong>. In 2013, it won the Golden Bridge Award (thegrand prize) at the 14th World Folklore Festival, Turkey, for the second time.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Lucrecia R.

Daet, Camarines Norte 24 Jan 1916. d. Oct 2013. Dancer, teacher, choreographer, director. She married Ramon Dinglasan Belmonte, pianist of the University of the Philippines (UP) <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a> and Dance Troupe. She obtained her bachelor of science in education from UP in 1936, a master&rsquo;s degree in physical education (PE) from the Illinois State Normal University in 1953 as a Fulbright scholar of the US Educational Foundation, and a doctorate in Philosophy from the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While studying at UP, she was a principal dancer of the UP troupe headed by Francisca Reyes-Tolentino (later Aquino), from 1933 to 1939. At the outbreak of the war, she started teaching at the Philippine Normal School (later College, now University) where she later headed the PE department. During World War II, she organized dance numbers for the vaudeville productions of Jose Climaco in State Theater and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\"><strong>Fernando Poe</strong></a> Sr in Avenue Theater. In 1946, she organized the mixed dancing class in the college, which became the Philippine Normal College (PNC) Baranggay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Troupe. The adopted name came with the performance for the first Philippine Floating Exposition to the Southeast Asian countries in 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the group became independent of PNU, it modified its name to Baranggay Folk Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. As chairperson, Belmonte promoted the course in Physical Education in all levels, to the BSE, major in PE in 1970, to the master&rsquo;s degree in PE, major in dance and sports in 1976. She also became &ldquo;Mommy Bel&rdquo; to PE majors in the National College of Physical Education (for a time the Marcos Sports Academy, and later, the Philippine Institute of Physical Education and Sports), UST, and the Baguio Vacation Normal School. She was leader and president of various associations such as the Philippine Association of Physical Education and Sports, Leisure Education and Recreation of the Philippines, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\"><strong>Philippine Folk Dance Society</strong></a>. She was director-general of the 22nd world congress of the International Congress of Health, Physical Education, and Recreation, held in Manila in 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the Baranggay troupe, she continued the work of Reyes-Aquino in promoting Philippine folk dances. With the support of her husband and family, she led the group in winning international fame and recognition as ambassador of goodwill. It visited Southeast Asian countries, Europe, Great Britain, United States, Canada, Australia, China, and the USSR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among her awards are the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan from the City of Manila and the Presidential Medal of Merit from the Republic of the Philippines, 1971; the PNC Hall of Fame Award for National and International relations, 1974; the Dance in Education Award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2441\"><strong>Dance Education Association of the Philippines</strong></a>, 1987; Gawad CCP Para sa Sining, 1990; CCP Centennial Honors, 1999; PAMA-AS Gintong BAI Award for outstanding works in the field of Philippine dance, 2005; and Outstanding Alumna in the field of Philippine folk dance by UP Alumni Association, 1989.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Larry A.

Dancer, teacher, choreographer, critic. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><strong>Myra Beltran</strong></a> is the daughter of Pedro Nanquil Beltran, an ex-navy captain, and Patria Antonietta Castro, a master&rsquo;s degree holder in literary criticism. Her sister is dancer Ida Genevieve Beltran-Lucila who was a former executive director of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a>. Beltran holds a bachelor of science in business economics and a master&rsquo;s degree in comparative literature, both from the University of the Philippines. She trained with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2439\"><strong>Vella Damian</strong></a> and Eric V.

In 1979, Beltran attended Indiana University as a dance major, training with Nicholas Beriozoff and Marina Svetlova. Later, she also trained with Jovanka Bjegojevic and Milica Jovanovic of Yugoslavia, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2505\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2506\"><strong>Enrico Labayen</strong></a></strong></a> of The Lab, Projekt-Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her search for her form, body, and self, Beltran discovered contemporary dance as her medium, and has since explored dance in very specific sociopolitical and cultural terms, propelled by physical and intellectual imperatives. She pursued a dance career in the United States in the late 1970s and early 1980s, after which she went to Eastern Europe, and worked with Ballet Oldenburg in Germany and Ballet of Prishtina in Yugoslavia. Back home, performing with Ballet Philippines and The Lab, Projekt-Philippines, she discovered that her practice is deeply embedded in a specific context that cannot be considered universal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1994, she produced <strong><em>Women Waiting</em></strong>. A year later, sheformed her company <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2442\"><strong>Dance Forum</strong></a>.

The first conference on dance and gender, spearheaded by Basilio Esteban Villaruz and sponsored by National Commission for Culture and the Arts Committee in 1998, gave Beltran the opportunity to further express her deep concern for the interlocking issues of dance and gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For her range of collaborative works, vision for dance, and discourse, Beltran has received the Alab ng Haraya for Individual Recognition in the Performing Arts from the NCCA in 2001, the Tanging Parangal from the City of Manila in 2007, and an Asian Cultural Council Grant in 2012.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Ruth Jordana L.

He was born in&nbsp;San Pablo, Laguna on 16 Jul 1918. He died in Manila on&nbsp;27 Jan 1989. He was the son of Trinidad Gutierrez and Paulino Casimiro, a comedian of the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><em>komedya</em></a>. He finished elementary school at the Caloocan Elementary School. He married choreographer Nieves Manuel, with whom he had two children. His son Bayani Jr. is also an actor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At age seven, he entered show business as a clown and comedian, earning 50 centavos for his act. He loved to dance, particularly tap, and won in a song and dance contest at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a>. He also won in an amateur singing contest in 1928 for his rendition of &ldquo;Rainbow on the River.&rdquo; In 1936 he visited Hawaii as part of a performing troupe headed by Sarsuwela Queen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang dela Rama</a>. By the late 1930s, Casimiro&rsquo;s tap dancing had earned him the nickname &ldquo;The Fred Astaire of the Philippines,&rdquo; as he was often dressed up in top hat and tails like Fred Astaire. During this time, he headlined numerous&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">bodabil</a>&nbsp;</em>productions in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1938, Casimiro appeared in his first movie, Excelsior Films&rsquo; <strong><em>Bayan at Pag-ibig</em></strong> (Country and Love). After some time he transferred to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a> and later became part of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador</a>&rsquo;s stage shows. During World War II, when local film productions ceased, bodabil productions became the primary source of entertainment in Manila. Along with many other actors such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4299\">Norma Blancaflor</a>, Casimiro became very popular. It was also during this time that Casimiro met his stage partner Jose Cris Soto, and the two performed at the Life Theater in Manila. Because of the success of their team, they came to be known as the &ldquo;Oliver and Hardy of the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, Casimiro went back to his film career. In 1947, he met Rodolfo Vera Quizon Sr, better known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>, who performed at the Orient Theater under the stage name &ldquo;Golay.&rdquo; The two became comic dance partners. Casimiro also continued to play small roles in more than a hundred films, such as <strong><em>Pilipino Kostum, No Touch </em></strong>(Filipino Custom, No Touch), 1955;&nbsp;<strong><em>Captain Barbell</em></strong>, 1973;&nbsp;<strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1135\"><strong>Burlesk Queen</strong></a></em></strong> (Burlesque Queen), 1977;&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><em><strong>Titser</strong>&rsquo;s Pet</em></strong> (Teacher&rsquo;s Pet), 1981.&nbsp;In his old age, Casimiro would still perform as character actor in film comedies, playing the role of an eccentric old man prone to ridicule, such as in <em><strong>E.T. (Estong Tutong)</strong></em>, 1983; <em><strong>Horsey&nbsp;Horsey&nbsp;Tigidig&nbsp;Tigidig</strong></em>, 1986; <em><strong>Buy One Take One</strong></em>, 1988; and <em><strong>Magic to Love</strong></em>, 1989. His most popular role in his later years was in the sitcom <strong><em>Okey Ka, Fairy Ko!</em></strong> (You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy!), as the father of Vic Sotto&rsquo;s character, Enteng Kabisote.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2457\"><strong>Marge C.

Roberta (aka Roberta Lee Cassell, born Roberta Lee Applegate in Saint Maries, Benewah County, Idaho, USA 30 Nov 1923; d. USA 26 Jun 2012;also a dancer, choreographer, and dance teacher). Roberta&#39;s parents were Washington Applegate and Grace Ann Sowell. She studied with Cassell, graduated in dance, and the other arts from the Cornish School in Seattle, Washington, and appeared in musicals in New York like <strong><em>Oklahoma</em></strong> and <strong><em>Hello,</em></strong><strong><em>Dolly! </em></strong> Ricardo married Robertain 3 Dec 1943.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ricardo Cassell studied with Gladys Height, Nicholas Tsoukolas, Lee Foley, Ivan Novikoff, Prideaux, Vicenzo Celli, and Bentley Stone. He danced with the opera companies of San Carlo, the Seattle Civic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>, and the Bentley Stone-Ruth Page <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, and became ballet master of the Seattle Civic Opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He first came to the Philippines in World War II with the US Army Air Corps. He became chief of the facility at Janic Tower (now Nichols Tower). After the war, he returned to instruct Philippine air traffic controllers at the Manila (now Ninoy Aquino) International Airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of Roberta Cassell&rsquo;s part-time teaching in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2503\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Kane</strong></a>&rsquo;s School of Classic Dance, he started teaching ballet in Manila. They were both invited to establish the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2405\"><strong>Manila Ballet</strong></a> Academy by one of their pupils, Pacita Madrigal-Warns. In 1950, it presented the Philippine premiere of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a></em></strong> with Pacita Madrigal-Warns as Giselle, BenjaminVillanuevaReyes as Albrecht, and GretaMonserrat as Myrtha.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After teaching for a while at the Young Women&rsquo;s Christian Association (YWCA), the couple established the Cassell Dance Studio around 1952. In YWCA, they founded the StudioDanceGroup in 1953. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2600\"><strong>Studio Dance Group</strong></a> aimed to professionalize ballet dancing in the Philippines. It sent Villanueva to New York on a scholarship. It also built a repertoire which helped to develop dancers. Among their ballets were: Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s <strong><em>FifthSymphony</em></strong>,1954, by Ricardo and Roberta Cassell; <strong><em>Street Scene</em></strong>, <strong><em>Lost Generation</em></strong> and <strong><em>Lament</em></strong>,between 1954 and 1955, all to Gershwin and by Ricardo Cassell; <strong><em>Adagietto</em></strong>,1954, to Mahler and by Ricardo Cassell, based on a poem by JoseLardizabal; <strong><em>The Transgressor</em></strong>, 1954, to Gould and by Ricardo Cassell; <strong><em>Ballet Blanc</em></strong>,1954, to Luigini and by Roberta Cassell; <strong><em>Sketch</em></strong><strong><em>Class</em></strong>,1954, to Offenbach and by Ricardo Cassell; <strong><em>GraduationBall</em></strong>, 1955, to Strauss and by Ricardo and Roberta Cassell; <strong><em>Backstage</em></strong>,1953/1954, by Ricardo Cassell; and <strong><em>Merry</em></strong><strong><em>Wives of Windsor</em></strong>,1954, and <strong><em>Divertissements</em></strong>,1955, to several composers and by Ricardo Cassell. Around this period, he also choreographed <strong><em>Beauty and the Beast</em></strong> to Ravel, and <strong><em>Peter and the Wolf</em></strong> to Prokofiev. Cassell also choreographed a Filipino movie production of <strong><em>Lady Be Good</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1955, the Roman Catholic Church hierarchy banned girls in Catholic schools from studying ballet. This had a grave consequence on the efforts of the Cassells such that they decided to return to the United States in 1956. Ricardo Cassell worked with the Federal Aviation Administration and occasionally taught as a guest teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He visited Manila in 1981 and again, with Roberta Cassell, in 1983. A tribute performance was held at the Colegio de San Agustin in Makati. Ricardo taught master classes at the CulturalCenterofthePhilippines (CCP) Dance School, the University of the Philippines College of Music, and the Elejar-Fabella School of Dance. In 1988, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine Ballet Theatre</strong></a> paid tribute to him in its season titled <strong><em>Homage</em></strong> at the CCP. The Cassells are credited with having brought the art of ballet to a certain level of professional competence with the seasons of the Studio Dance Group, which brought together the most outstanding dancers in the Philippines at the time.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>CULTURAL CENTER OF THE PHILIPPINES</b><b> </b>(<b>CCP</b>) The CCP is the leading institution in the country that plans and implements programs for the development and promotion of the arts&mdash;music, dance, theater, visual, literary, cinematic, and broadcast arts. Since 1969 when it was created by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos, it has sponsored programs and activities such as festivals, exhibitions, competitions, and publications to preserve, promote, and enhance the artistic and cultural heritage of the Filipino people, and to develop audiences that will appreciate and support artistic and cultural work. It is home to nine resident companies that present regular seasons of productions, workshops, and outreach performances: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong> <strong><strong>Ballet</strong> Philippines</strong> </strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\"><strong>Bayanihan Philippine National</strong><strong>FolkDance</strong>  <strong>Company</strong></a>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine Ballet Theatre</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\"><strong>Philippine Madrigal Singers</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"><strong>Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\"><strong>Tanghalang Pilipino</strong></a></strong>, and UST Symphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitting on a 60-hectare complex on Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, the CCP is part of a vast international network of arts and culture organizations that provide exchange opportunities between Filipino artists and artists from all over the world. This network also brings in performances and exhibitions that allow local audiences to experience arts and cultures from elsewhere. These organizations include the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Center, the Conseil International des Organisations de Festivals de Folklore et d&rsquo;Arts Traditionnels, the World Dance Alliance, the International Theater Institute, the Asian Theater Alliance, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, and the ASEAN&ndash;Korea Traditional Music Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is composed of several departments that promote arts education, direct outreach and exchange programs all over the country, mount productions and exhibitions, manage cultural holdings, and develop its assets. In its first two decades the CCP focused on what were later perceived as elitist performing arts&mdash;theater, ballet, opera, and similar shows&mdash;a bias that was shaped by its first board of trustees chair, then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos. Following the successful EDSA revolt against Marcos and his martial rule and the subsequent change in the country&rsquo;s leadership, the CCP expanded its scope to include literature, film, and broadcast arts, among others. It also reoriented its direction to emphasize original Filipino artistic and cultural expressions rooted in the Philippines and the participation of the regions in the definition of a national culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music. </b>The CCP is home to the country&rsquo;s premier symphonic orchestra, the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO). Established in 1973, the PPO (then known as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra) initially accompanied local and foreign performing artists at the CCP. It later evolved as one of the best music ensembles in the Asia-Pacific region, premiering works by Filipino and foreign composers, and promoting music appreciation throughout the country. Past conductors and musical directors of the PPO include  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\"><strong>Luis Valencia</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\"><strong>Oscar Yatco</strong></a></strong>, Ruggero Barbieri, Olivier Ochanine, and Yoshikazu Fukumura.Among the internationally renowned conductors who have performed with the PPO are Mendi Rodan, Piero Gamba, Enrique Batis, Sebastian Bereau, and Nicholas Koch. Some of the world&rsquo;s best Filipino and foreign artists have also performed with the PPO, including Van Cliburn, Renata Tebaldi, Judith Engel, Anthony Camden, David Benoit,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\"><strong>Cecile Licad</strong></a></strong>,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\"><strong>Raul Sunico</strong></a></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Lea Salonga</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>. The PPO is now on its 34th concert season. It has toured in Europe, Asia, and more recently, the United States, when it performed for the first time at the Carnegie Hall. Aside from its regular concert seasons at the CCP, the PPO also participates in the CCP Outreach Program by performing in public spaces and conducting workshops in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another resident company of the CCP is the Philippine Madrigal Singers. Organized in 1963 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\"><strong>Andrea O. Veneracion</strong></a>, later National Artist for music, the choir is composed of students, teachers, and alumni from the various colleges of the University of the Philippines. Performing a wide repertoire of various styles and forms, the ensemble has consistently won all the top prizes in most of the world&rsquo;s prestigious choral competitions. The choir also maintains an active outreach and concert schedule every year and is regarded as one of the country&rsquo;s most active ambassadors of goodwill and one of the world&rsquo;s most traveled choirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UST Symphony Orchestra is also a resident performing group of the CCP. It holds regular concerts at the CCP and participates in the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program. It also serves as a pool for additional players as the needs of the PPO dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, the CCP launched the <b><i>Filipino Artists Series</i></b> (FAS), a monthly program featuring solo performances of acclaimed and emerging Filipino musical artists. Among those featured in the FAS were bass baritone Jonathan Zaens; flutist  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4057\"><strong>Antonio Maigue</strong></a></strong>; cellist Wilfredo Pasamba; pianists Corazon Kabayao, Mariel Illusorio, Peter Porticos, and Rene Dalandan; violinists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Gilopez Kabayao</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong></a>, Gina Medina, and Denise Huang; and sopranos Clarissa Ocampo and Maria Cristina Viguilla-Navarro. FAS was discontinued in 2009 but was later revived in 2012 as the <b><i>Special Concert Series</i></b>. Some of the performing artists in this series are pianist Charisse Baldoria, soprano Katrina Saporsantos, cellist Antoni Josef Inacay, trumpet player Raymond de Leon, percussionist Aimee Mina dela Cruz, and flutist Sarah Mae Gabuyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP also embarked on the production of Filipino operas as well as Western operas that were adapted to a Philippine setting. In 1970, it partnered with the  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\"><strong>Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</strong></a></strong> in producing <b><i><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong> </i></b> (Subversion), the operatic adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong> <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </strong></a>&rsquo;s novel, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3965\"><strong>Felipe Padilla de Leon</strong></a> and libretto by  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\"><strong>Guillermo Tolentino</strong></a></strong>.

In recognition of the broad reach and powerful influence of radio and television, the CCP established in 1987 a Coordinating Center for Broadcast Arts which was one of the units of the then Visual, Literary, and Media Arts Department. While all these units have been replaced by the Media Arts Division, the CCP&mdash;then and now&mdash;has continued efforts to equip ordinary citizens with the skills to produce radio programs and videos that reflect their realities and that allow them to promote their sectoral interests through broadcasting. It conducts hands-on training-workshops on radio and television production and scriptwriting, accepts apprenticeships, and awards production grants. While bringing its training program to as far north as Batanes and as far south as Tawi-tawi, the CCP encourages the use of Filipino languages in the programs and videos produced by its trainees. Among those who complete the training programs and are given grants to produce their own radio programs are farmers, fisherfolk, social development and cultural workers, students, and local leaders who produce and host talk shows, historical documentaries, instructional programs, public service announcements, music shows, and dramatizations of Filipino myths and legends. Their productions are aired in cooperation with local radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP produces television programs as well as videos.

The association set the following objectives: to promote cooperation and understanding among teachers, experts, and enthusiasts in the improvement of the quality of life through dance; to professionalize the teaching and administration of the dance and related fields; to provide a forum for local, national, and global issues in dance; to foster research activities in the field; and to support the formation and development of national policies and programs in dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In coordination with the Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS), the DEAP conducts national seminar-workshops every summer supported by the school which provides the venue, and sometimes with the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). The convention-workshops cover a range of topics geared towards teachers, supervisors, and administrators from public and private elementary and secondary schools, dance directors and instructors, choreographers and dance enthusiasts. In the past years, some of the issues discussed were globalization and its effects on dance, in particular folk/ethnic dance; preservation and dissemination of dance; and the implications on dance of the 2015 ASEAN Integration. These events have been held around the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Membership has expanded from 57 in 1982 to over 500 in 1991. DEAP conducts annual folk dance workshops held in various parts of the Philippines. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Carmen T. Andin, with notes from Ruth Jordanan L.

It was later converted into a dance studio which the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2440\"><strong>Dance Concert <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a></strong></a>, under Eric V. Cruz and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2439\"><strong>Vella Damian</strong></a> (the first teacher of Dance Forum&rsquo;s artistic director, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><strong>Myra Beltran</strong></a>) used. It eventually became the rehearsal studio of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2404\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Federation of the Philippines</strong></a>, where ballet master <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2542\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Morgan</strong></a> conducted classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1995, independent choreographer/dancer Beltran established Dance Forum as an alternative performing venue. The studio was opened with the performance of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/190\"><strong>Star Maiden</strong></a></em></strong>, her first full-length solo. The idea behind this solo articulated the path of Dance Forum and its director, who at that time, felt &ldquo;alone, seemingly pushing a big rock up a mountain or placing a stone one in front of another to step unto in a sea of nothingness.&rdquo; As an independent artist, she kept her faith, believing that she &ldquo;belonged&mdash;a Filipino, child of a farmer and a star maiden&rdquo; (Message, <strong><em>Nostalgia: Grande Tango</em></strong>, 2007). In 1997, Beltran, together with Chameleon Dance Company, initiated the conversion of the space into a studio-theater. With the difficulties of espousing nonmainstream choreographic practices, Dance Forum embarked as a space for collaborative projects among artists in different fields. The word &ldquo;Forum&rdquo; in the name indicates Beltran&rsquo;s idea of dance as discourse, an art worthy of discussion among scholars, dancers, and choreographers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Alliance Francaise Manille, Dance Forum presented <strong><em>Quartet for the End of Time</em></strong>, 1998, with the Pundaquit Chamber Players, one of its first successful collaborative projects. This was followed by productions with other artists, like <strong><em>Folds of Midnight</em></strong>, 1990, <strong><em>The Romeo</em></strong><strong><em>and Juliet Project</em></strong>, 2001, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/152\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a> Asu</strong></a>: 1719-2009 </em></strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1916\"><strong>Onyx</strong></a> Wolf: 1719-2009), 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, independent artists in the Philippines became visible as the Dance Forum studio offered itself as a clearing for discussions and creations with dancers/choreographers/companies. Among them, Katrina Mercado, Katherine Sanchez, Joanne Dela Calzada, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2505\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2506\"><strong>Enrico Labayen</strong></a></strong></a>, Flordeliza Fernandez, Airdance, Dancing Wounded, and the UP Dance Company; musicians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\"><strong>Jonas Baes</strong></a>, Alfonso &ldquo;Coke&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3909\"><strong>Ramon Bolipata</strong></a>, Ramon Santos, and Otto Hernandez; poets and fictionists Virginia Moreno and Randy Bustamante; visual artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Cajipe-Endaya</strong></a>, Robert Feleo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3547\"><strong>Karen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a></strong></a>, Felix Miguel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\"><strong>Roberto Villanueva</strong></a>, and Katti Sta.

Dance Forum has likewise produced choreographers and ensembles through their new works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The productions of Dance Forum have been inspired by literary texts, re-readings of history, pieces on women, and discourses on the nature of dance. Dance Forum performed <strong><em>Payatas: Point Counterpoint</em></strong> during &ldquo;Global Dance 2002 (The Future of Dance: Aesthetics of Diversity),&rdquo; the World Dance Alliance Festival in Dusseldorf, Germany. With Beltran as the founding director of the Contemporary Dance Map Series since 2005, and of the WiFi Body Independent Contemporary Dance Festival since 2006, Dance Forum Studio Space has seen numerous choreographic works from both festivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, Dance Forum was given the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Award for Best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/50\"><strong>Cultural Dance</strong></a> Group.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ruth Jordana L.

After years in Metro Manila as principal soloist of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a>, member of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2559\"><strong>Powerdance</strong></a> company, cofounder (with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2541\"><strong>Paul <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es</strong></a> and Gerald Mercado) of the E-dance Theatre, and later, also cofounder and chief choreographer and associate artistic director of Airdance, Rodrigazo returned to Bacolod to establish his school and company. With the name Dance Pull already in his mind, Rodrigazo converted what used to be a club with huge TV screens into a dance studio. This included a lounging area for the students and a room for guest choreographers and friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trained in classical and modern ballet and contemporary dance, Rodrigazo kept all three genres in his school, believing that a combination of ballet and contemporary dance complements the Filipino body and talent. With both paying students and scholars, the school also offers hip-hop, break dance, jazz dance, ballroom dance, and gymnastics. The scholars of the Dance Pull Kids come from all over Negros Occidental. They have also been given intensive dance workshops in popping and locking by Reagan Cornelio and Prince Paltu-ob, International Champion hip-hoppers and former members of the internationally renowned street grooves group, the Philippine All-Stars. In addition to dance training, the girls are given lessons in singing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rodrigazo describes the choreographic style of the company&rsquo;s works as &ldquo;directional motivation,&rdquo; developing other movement direction. The technique the school takes is characterized by &ldquo;resistance and release&rdquo; &ndash; terms in ballet which have been transformed in the works of the company. In 2007, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/156\"><strong>Karga Tapas</strong></a></em></strong> (Cut and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>Loa</strong></a>d), a debut piece about the plight of the<em>sakada</em>(sugar cane workers) in Negros, premiered in Sigma, Capiz, exhibiting the synergy of dance techniques of the company, and the movements and culture of the sakada. It was also performed for the 2008  <strong><em>WiFi Body</em></strong> Dance Festival at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>. <strong><em>Birds of the Mind</em></strong>, performed at the 4th <em><strong>WiFi Body</strong> </em>Dance Festival in 2009, captures the humming and tweeting of birds and their flapping and swooping in flight, which metaphysically parallel what besets and characterizes Philippine society, from serious issues to the lightest, plus the funniest Filipino eccentricities. The two works show distinct movement vocabularies emerging from the same cultural context. Rodrigazo has created several works for the company and encourages his dancers to choreograph, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, Dance Pull launched the Contemporary Movement Analysis Program (C-MAP), independently organized and facilitated by Rodrigazo, which aims to be a regular workshop to be participated in by aspiring choreographers around the country. Rodrigazo envisions Dance Pull to produce more contemporary works that respond to and complement Negros&rsquo;s life and landscape.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ruth Jordana L.

In July of that year, it debuted at the Rizal Theater in a production directed by Poul Gnatt. Its repertoire included Gnatt&rsquo;s and Russell Kerr&rsquo;s works, with the Philippine premiere of Bartok&rsquo;s <strong><em>Miraculous Mandarin</em></strong> and some Bournonvillle dances. Critic AnthonyMorli called DTP as the country&rsquo;s first professional dance group. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of its ballerinas was TinaSantos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next productions were mostly Filipino, like Borromeo&rsquo;s <strong><em>ZagalasdeManila</em></strong> (Young Maidens of Manila) and <strong><em>Kalingan</em></strong>,Elejar&rsquo;s <strong><em>Katakata Sin Rajah</em></strong><strong><em>Indarapatra</em></strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a> of Rajah Indarapatra), Radaic&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/194\"><strong>Tanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Elopement), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2510\"><strong>Luis Layag</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Take</em></strong><strong><em>Four</em></strong> to new music by Felix Padilla Jr. In 1969 the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) commissioned Borromeo and Radaic to choreograph <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\"><strong>Eliseo M. Pajaro</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\"><strong>Jose Garcia Villa</strong></a>&rsquo;s ballet <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/168\"><strong>Mir-i-nisa</strong></a></em></strong>. Meanwhile, the company implemented its Cultural Outreach in Education or CORE that brought ballet to schools and communities in Metro Manila (including filling up the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a>), all the way to Cebu, Bacolod, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>. This time the ballet masters were TonyLlacer and Israel Gabriel, who also danced and choreographed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a hiatus, DTP was revived under Radaic&rsquo;s direction, with the premiere of Radaic and Pajaro&rsquo;s <strong><em>MayDayEve</em></strong> and Janacek-Basilio&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Rebels</em></strong> in 1971. Gradually, it based itself in Radaic&rsquo;s school of dance in St. Theresa&rsquo;s College in Manila and Quezon City. Resident choreographers were Radaic and Basilio. Robin Haig performed in and produced more ballets, including the classic <strong><em>Pas de</em></strong><strong><em>Quatre</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1975, DTP participated in the International Festival of Youth Orchestras and Performing Arts in Aberdeen, London, and Cardiff with rave reviews. In 1979 they repeated the same success in Europe. They also appeared on Grampian television and were featured by the BBC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1973 to 1986, DTP gave monthly performances on the Rizal Park stage under the National Parks Development committee headed by Teodoro F. Valencia. Between 1981 and 1983, it ran two fully subscribed seasons at the Meralco Theater. Between 1984 and 1989, it was the resident dance company at the University of the Philippines College of Music. All these activities developed dancers like Loulie Dalupan, Irene and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2581\"><strong>Hazel Sabas</strong></a>, Emellie Rigonan, Sophia Radaic, Mary Anne Santamaria, AnnaVilladolid, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2523\"><strong>Lisa Macuja</strong></a>, Eloisa Enerio, Jonathan Terry, Roberto Clemente, and Vivencio Samblace&ntilde;o Jr. Between 1980 and 1987 Basilio took over as artistic director. Since 1971, Basilio did more than 40 ballets for the company. Since the Asian Arts Festival in Hong Kong in 1980, he has choreographed Bartok&rsquo;s <strong><em>Third Piano</em></strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\"><strong>Concerto</strong></a></em></strong> as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/197\"><strong>Testament</strong></a></em></strong>, RyanCayabyab&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>Filipina</em></strong> (Filipino Mass), and RamonP.Santos&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/120\"><strong>Awit</strong></a></em></strong> (Song), <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>nag</em></strong> (Translucence), and <strong><em>Muling Pagsilang</em></strong> (Rebirth). Other regular choreographers were TonyFabella, GenerCaringal, Lucy Layag-de los Reyes, Elejar, Borromeo, and Radaic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1986 the company paid tribute to Radaic at the Rizal Theater with a show, hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2590\"><strong>Tina Santos</strong></a>. In 1988 it celebrated its 20th anniversary at the Meralco Theater, featuring <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a></em></strong> with Lisa Macuja and NonoyFroilan. In 1989 it revived <strong><em>Mir-i-nisa</em></strong> at the CCP, again choreographed by Borromeo and Radaic. It featured young ballerinas Mylene Salda&ntilde;a, Anna Marie Tirol, Rose Miranda, Katrina Santos, and guest <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2543\"><strong>Melanie Motus</strong></a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Theatre</strong></a> (PBT). Ballet mistress was SoniaDomingo. For 23 years, DTP existed alongside the CCP-subsidized BalletPhilippines (BP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DTP was the only company that required its members to take an international examination through the Royal Academy of Dancing, to instill professional discipline among its artist-members, preparing them further for international careers in classical ballet. DTP preceded BP by two years, and from 1987 to 1989, was a sister company of PBT, ensuring the existence of the fledgling company with the support of its dancers and repertoire. To the end, Radaic kept the company alive and nurtured many young dancers who earned their own places in national and international dance companies.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Vienna, Austria 21 Jan 1913 d. Los Angeles, California, USA 1976. Dancer, teacher, choreographer. As a child, Dubsky-Zipper joined Max Reinhardt&rsquo;s production of <strong><em>AMidsummerNight&rsquo;sDream</em></strong> and other productions in Europe. She studied dance at the State Academy of Music and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1063\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong></a>tic Arts, and later toured Europe as a soloist of Gertrude Bodenwieser&rsquo;s dance ensemble. She then taught at the Vienna State Academy and established her own school in 1931 with Jeanette Rutherstone. At the same time, she taught special courses in England, at the Bedford Physical Training College, the Royal Academy of Dancing, and for Margaret Craske. She also choreographed for the Camargo Society, collaborating with its musical director Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1934 she rejoined the Bodenwieser group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Invited by Kaethe Hauser to Manila in 1937, she taught modern dance at the Academy of Music and foreign dances at the University of the Philippines. Under the auspices of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\"><strong>Asociacion <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a> de Filipinas</strong></a>, headed by Rosario Valdes, she formed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2405\"><strong>Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a></strong></a> Moderne. In 1939 she married fellow Viennese <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4236\"><strong>Herbert Zipper</strong></a>, who had just been released from a Nazi concentration camp. A symphony orchestra conductor, Zipper took over the leadership of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> (MSO) after the death of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4044\"><strong>Alexander Lippay</strong></a>. In Nov of that year, Dubsky-Zipper premiered her works: <strong><em>Petite Suite&mdash;Au Bord de la Seine</em></strong> by Debussy, <strong><em>The Iron Foundry</em></strong> by Mossolow, <strong><em>Peer Gynt Suite</em></strong> by Grieg, and <strong><em>Voices of</em></strong><strong><em>Spring</em></strong> by Strauss. In 1940 she presented <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/181\"><strong>Pictures at an Exhibition</strong></a></em></strong> by Moussorgsky, <strong><em>Plovetsky</em></strong><strong><em>Dances</em></strong> from <strong><em>Prince</em></strong><strong><em>Igor</em></strong> by Borodin, and <strong><em>The Toy Box</em></strong> by Schubert. The 1941 concert featured one new work, <strong><em>The Women of Arles</em></strong> to Bizet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outbreak of World War II in Dec 1941 halted theater activities, and the Zippers joined the underground resistance. In 1942 Dubsky-Zipper conducted dance classes on the rooftop of her apartment, and her students, taking any means of transportation available, paid their fees in cash or in kind. At war&rsquo;s end, she immediately revived Manila Ballet Moderne and presented dance concerts for the troops of the United States Armed Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), while Zipper conducted the MSO in 250 concerts held in ruined churches and the Rex Theater in Chinatown. Responding to a fund raising appeal from Pres Sergio Osme&ntilde;a, the Zippers went to the United States in 1946 to solicit funds in 21 cities. She performed and lectured in the United States West Coast, and later joined her husband in New York, establishing a school in Brooklyn, teaching at drama workshops and choreographing for recitals and off-Broadway productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon their return to Manila in 1951, Dubsky-Zipper choreographed <strong><em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Fateful <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\"><strong>Dress</strong></a></em></strong> in 1952, <strong><em>Bastien and Bastienne</em></strong> in collaboration with CesarLegaspi and NickJoaquin, and <strong><em>Pieta</em></strong> to Hindemith. From 1954 to 1969, she directed operas: Strauss&rsquo;s <strong><em>Die Fledermaus</em></strong>,1954; Smetana&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Bartered Bride</em></strong>, 1955; Bizet&rsquo;s <strong><em>Carmen</em></strong> in Filipino, 1956 and 1958; Mozart&rsquo;s <strong><em>Abduction from the Seraglio</em></strong>, 1958; Handel&rsquo;s <strong><em>Acis and Galatea</em></strong> and Ibert&rsquo;s <strong><em>Angelique</em></strong>,1959; Puccini&rsquo;s <strong><em>Gianni Schicchi</em></strong> (translated as <strong><em>Juancho Gancho</em></strong> <em>)</em>,1961; Stravinsky&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Soldier&rsquo;s Tale</em></strong>,1969; Donizetti&rsquo;s <strong><em>Rita</em></strong>; Menotti&rsquo;s <strong><em>El Campanillo</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Medium</em></strong>; andVon Suppe&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Beautiful Galathea</em></strong>,and <strong><em>Charlie Brown&rsquo;s</em></strong><strong><em>Snoopy</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dubsky-Zipper was a shaping force in Philippine dance. She was an innovator in movement technique, expressive style, and stage production. She had a creative and teaching vigor that made possible the participation of laymen in dance. She easily recognized, nurtured, and optimized the dance capability and communicability of the Filipino. On the other hand, Filipinos easily found rapport and reward in her manner of dancing. This reciprocal relationship lasted for 32 years and produced a whole generation of performers, teachers, and enthusiasts, who in turn influenced later directions and achievements in Philippine dance.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

The group, coached by Corazon I&ntilde;igo, was initially composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> members recruited from the university&rsquo;s Physical Education Department under Alfredo Reyes.

Also included in the group&rsquo;s repertory were: <strong><em>OfCocksandKings</em></strong>, 1958, based on a story by AlfredoRoces, to music by LucreciaR.Kasilag, <strong><em>Feminine Gender</em></strong>, using words and movement, and <strong><em>Fanfare</em></strong>, to music by B.

Founded in 1958 by National Artist LeonorOrosa-Goquingco to interpret her original choreographies, it was an independent, unsubsidized group until the 1970s, dedicated to Orosa-Goquingco&rsquo;s vision, as dramatized in the full-evening panorama titled <strong><em>Filipinescas:PhilippineLife, LegendandLoreinDance</em></strong>, 1961. A conflation of Philippine history, legend, and cultural practices, the work is considered to have presented many &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; in Philippine dance, some of which are the first choreography of local Lenten practices, the first dance staging of a fiesta, the first choreography of the Philippine game<em>palo sebo</em>; and the first choreography of the<em>sabong</em>or Philippine cockfight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the 1960s to the 1970s, Orosa-Goquingco led FDC&rsquo;s seven tours abroad, each time on a cultural goodwill mission. The first trip in 1961 extended to seven months, during which FDC won the grand prize under the category &ldquo;folk-inspired&rdquo; at the Fourth Ibero Americana Folkloric Festival held in Caceres, Spain. FDC was also invited to the 10th International Music Festival in Santander, Spain, where it was highly praised. On its opening night in Paris, France, FDC received 15 curtain calls, 22 on the second night, and more on the third and fourth nights. It was the first dance company in the Philippines to perform in the United Arab Republic, East and West Pakistan, and Portugal. It also performed in West Germany, Norway, Washington DC, and Honolulu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon its return, FDC performed with the De Lavallade-Ailey American Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in the Philippine-American Dance Festival held in Mar 1962 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a>. In Jun 1962, it performed in Malaysia and Thailand, before <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>n and Thai royalty. &ldquo;Asalto,&rdquo; &ldquo;Morolandia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Bird and the Planters&rdquo; won rave notices. Similar accolades were heaped upon them in Hong Kong in 1968; in Moscow, Leningrad, and Riga in the former Soviet Union, Pakistan, Brussels, Portugal, and the United States, and Japan in 1970. The year 1974, which marked FDC&rsquo;s last public performance, was memorable with another round of tours in North and South America, Europe, Russia, Mexico, Hawaii, and Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, the De La Salle College of St. Benilde (DLSU-CB), under the term of its president Bro Armin Luistro, entered into a partnership with the revived-Filipinescas and committed to support the company. It was Goquingco&rsquo;s wish not only to resurrect the company but also to restage the highly-acclaimed <strong><em>Filipinescas: Philippine Life, Legend and Lore in Dance</em></strong>.Unfortunately, the production never returned onstage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among FDC&rsquo;s dancers were Erlinda Fernandez, Carole de la Paz, Rachelle Goquingco, Eloisa del Rosario, Rowena Aranda, Lina Javier, Violeta Neric, Violeta Manahan, Reynaldo Limcaco, EricV.Cruz, ReynaldoAlejandro, Roberto Caballero, Ramon Victoria, Pedro &ldquo;Edru&rdquo; Abraham (also a musician), Luis <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a>es, Danilo Dupaya, Dominador Correa, Emmanuel Batulan, Felipe Gaerlan, Jose Oliva, and Danilo Neri. Among its musicians were JerryDadap, Michael Dadap, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>MendozadeLeon, and ZenasReyes-Lozada.

Villaruz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation aims to preserve and promote Philippine traditional dances, to foster national pride through such heritage, and to nurture Philippine culture by conducting workshops and seminars and by giving awards to those who contribute to folk dance and its scholarship. Among its first awardees starts in 1991 were Belmonte and Reynaldo Eleazar, members of University of the Philippines <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a> and Dance Club in the 1930s; Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa and Crispin Gimena of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5322\"><strong>Carlos P.

To further disseminate dance education and ethnology, it also held a workshop for children arranged by the &ldquo;Grand Ladies of the Central Bank&rdquo; of the Philippines, and another one on dance ethnology in several universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Foundation&rsquo;s most enterprising ventures are its video-films. Among them are the dance-drama <strong><em>O Kikay</em></strong>, a collaboration among the Salinggawi Dance Troupe of the University of Santo Tomas, the Philippine Baranggay Folk Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, and the Sandiwang Kayumanggi Folk Dance Troupe of the Carlos P.

A prized project came in 2007 with the publication of <strong><em>Lola Kikay: Life and Work of Francisca Reyes Aquino</em></strong>, so far the only full-length book on the Philippines&rsquo; first National Artist for Dance.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Alfafara was born in Carcar, Cebu, in 1881. Not much is known about his early life except that an uncle, who was a balitaw practitioner, taught him the dance movements of the balitaw and that Indong quickly excelled in the form because of his natural gift for verse and rhyme and his resonant, melodious voice. Caniban was born in Mambaling, Cebu City in 1900, though other sources cite her birth year as 1906. She learned the art of the balitaw from her parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alfafara was the more experienced artist, performing with other women-partners whom he helped train, before he met Caniban. The two must have teamed up first around 1920. By the 1920s, they had become extremely popular, touring the towns of Cebu as well as places in Bohol, Leyte, Negros Oriental, and Mindanao. They were invited to perform during fiestas, carnivals, and other festivities, private as well as public. The two were in such demand that they had to turn down invitations. They commanded a high price for performing and audiences would shower them with coins as they performed. There are references to other balitaw performers before  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4017\"><strong>Indong-Colasing</strong></a></strong>, such as Hermenegildo(Amoros)Solon and his daughter Meding, ca 1916, but Indong-Colasing was the most popular pair of the prewar period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an interview published in <b><i>The Freeman </i></b>of 19 Nov 1926, Caniban said that she spontaneously composed the verses as she performed but that she and her partner would decide on a subject or theme beforehand, e.g., the unfortunate maiden, the deceitful promise, wealth breeds misery, or the patient wife. In the course of the performance, one of the partners might stray from the theme, thus testing the other&rsquo;s skill in improvising without missing a beat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caniban possessed an amulet which she believed gave her the power to attract attention. She carried this <i>mutya </i>in a bottle of oil tied around her waist and anointed herself with the oil before a performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the balitaw began to decline, the team split up. For a time, Alfafara continued performing with a new partner, Bebing Yba&ntilde;ez of Minglanilla, Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, both Alfafara and Caniban migrated to Mindanao. He settled down in Gingoog, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>mis Oriental, living the life of a farmer, while she raised a large family in Digos, Davao, where she sold fish in the market for a living. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byErlinda Alburo</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Manila 14 Sep 1952. Dancer, teacher, choreographer. Her parents were Mary Vita Beltran and Lowell Jackson. She is married to Eric Kevin Achacoso. She holds a degree in Fine Arts from the University of the Philippines (UP), 1974, and an MFA in dance, from the New York University-Tisch School of the Arts, 1985. Her master&rsquo;s thesis was a comparative study of selected kabuki theater plays and 19th century ballets. She later pursued her interest in Japanese traditional performing arts to include study of the noh theater. Her studies in both traditional Japanese art forms and her transformation of these to more contemporary mediums are a thematic thread found throughout her creative career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jackson started ballet with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2503\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Kane</strong></a> and became a member of the Pamana <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a>. After Kane left, she trained with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2515\"><strong>Tony Llacer</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2418\"><strong>Julie Borromeo</strong></a>, in whose <strong><em>Peter Pan</em></strong>, 1974, she played Wendy. She continued her training in New York with Cindi Green, Graciela Kozak, Dana Reitz, and Lawrence Rhodes, and took lessons in voice with Leona Matthews. Between 1978 and 1981, she was in <strong><em>The King and I</em></strong> on Broadway. In 1983, she danced with Chen and Dancers, and between 1983 and 1987, with the Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians. She served as rehearsal director in Dean&rsquo;s company from 1984 to 1987, and helped reconstruct five dances for its 1990 season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After receiving her MFA in 1985, Jackson started her career as a choreographer and in 1990, she founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2494\"><strong>Kristin Jackson</strong></a> Dance. She taught ballet and modern dance at Queens College, New York University, and Kane&rsquo;s school in Rohnert Park, California, in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1982, she has choreographed for the Salon Project, Daimon and Kristin Jackson Dances series.

Expanding her work from <strong><em>In Their Shoes</em></strong> and &ldquo;A Clearing and Other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a>&rdquo; used in the same work, she also created <strong><em>Wanla/Weave</em></strong>, 2001, a solo inspired by the Japanese-American internment in the United States.

Her solo, <strong><em>A Clearing</em></strong>, a work that articulated her ongoing studies of the Japanese Noh theater, premiered in 2003. In 2010, Jackson premiered <strong><em>Aeolian</em></strong>, a trio performed to an original jazz composition by Cecilia Coleman for La <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1465\"><strong>Mama</strong></a> Moves Festival at the Ellen Stewart Theater Annex in New York City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simultaneous with her work for the dance community, Jackson has also choreographed for theater and film productions.

Paranaque City 14 May 1953. Choreographer, dance director. He is the eldest son of politician Francisco Jose and Veronica Bautista, who comes from a musically-inclined family. Jose was keen to join folk dance activities from a young age but his father was strongly against a career in dance for his son. He graduated from Far Eastern University with a BS degree in chemistry. He worked for the Philippine Refining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (now Unilever) as a laboratory tester.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1976, stranded at Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU) during a typhoon, Jose found himself auditioning for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han and was accepted as a trainee. Dancing for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a> complemented his day job, until he was invited to the year-long world tour and was tapped as a researcher by dance director Lucrecia Urtula. Soon, she instructed him to assemble dances learned in the field for the stage. He was one of her five research assistants, assigned to dances in the Visayas and Southern Philippines, and Hispanic dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the auspices of the Bayanihan, Jose received a study grant for Developing Management at the Asian Institute of Management, from the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, through the Ramon Magsaysay Foundation. He was also able to study Public Diplomacy and International Relations at the Helena Z. Benitez School of International Relations and Diplomacy at the PWU.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Toward the late 1990s, Jose took over as assistant dance director, consulting with the retired Urtula until she passed away in 1999. Bayanihan artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3039\"><strong>Jose Lardizabal</strong></a> then appointed Jose as dance director of the company. Over the years, Jose&rsquo;s advocacy was to gradually adapt Bayanihan&rsquo;s repertoire to accommodate new research and to explore creative possibilities that were also culturally responsible. While still faithful to the Bayanihan repertoire, Jose added new works such as <strong><em>Mga Bagong Bayani sa Ibayong Dagat</em></strong> (The New Overseas Heroes)<em>,</em><strong><em>Isang Panimula</em></strong> (A Beginning)<em>,</em><strong><em>Malague&ntilde;a de Pila, Se&ntilde;oritas</em></strong> (Malague&ntilde;a of Pila, Young Ladies), and <strong><em>Larong Bata</em></strong> (Child Games). His <strong><em>Manlulurup</em></strong> (Divers)depicted pearl divers&rsquo;s activities, with the dancers harnessed from the top of the stage to depict an underwater scene. <strong><em>Mariposa Bella</em></strong> (Beautiful Butterfly) is a dance to show off Filipino dress, using the music of &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/974\"><strong>Paruparong Bukid</strong></a>&rdquo; (Country Butterfly). To close the performances, Jose choreographed <strong><em>Fiesta Extravaganza</em></strong>, a tribute to the country&rsquo;s ubiquitous street dancing, now a favorite among local and foreign audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More interested in how folk dance can be relevant to everyday Filipino life, the Bayanihan started a continuing project with several city governments called Teaching and Touching Lives, starting in Pagsanjan. Workshops were given to grade school children from the area, while Jose did research in the same area and choreographed a dance that reflected the local culture. The Pagsanjan workshop produced <strong><em>Bangkero</em></strong> (Boatman), which is now part of Bayanihan&rsquo;s repertoire. Succeeding workshops were held in the town of Liliw in Laguna, Marikina City, Ilocos Sur, and with the Manobo group in Butuan City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His <strong><em>Mindanao Suite</em></strong> won for the Bayanihan the Gold Temple Award at the 47th International Folk Festival in Sicily, Italy in 2002. At the 7th Gold Bridge <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Competition in Boyokcekmece Beledeyesi, Turkey, in 2007, the Bayanihan won first prize, while Jose was awarded Best Choreography. Jose was a member of the ad hoc committee for dance at the National Commission for Culture and Arts from 2003-06, and is an honorary member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\"><strong>Philippine Folk Dance Society</strong></a>. He received the Patnubay ng Sining from the City of Manila in 2003.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Joelle Florence P. Jacinto</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

As the Visayan word<em>kahayag</em>means &ldquo;light&rdquo; or &ldquo;radiance,&rdquo; the group wanted to make the arts integral to the national agenda on culture. The earlier choreographies of the company were based on the dance, music, and chants of the Tboli community in Lake Sebu and the Blaan of Cotabato. After performing at the Mindanao Theater Festival in Iligan in 1995, the group was invited to be part of the 1996 National Theater Festival at the CCP. During the festival, Kahayag was cited as one of the 10 Most Outstanding Theater Companies in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kahayag&rsquo;s most acclaimed and popular work is <strong><em>Tudbulul</em></strong>, 1994, a narrative dance that interprets the Tboli&rsquo;s great epic. Other choreographies of the company are <strong><em>Bulalakaw</em></strong> (Comet), 1993,a dance drama of an Ilonggo myth; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong></a>: Isang Ina</em></strong> (Sisa: A Mother),1997; <strong><em>Hu-do-boo: Scenes from the Last Day of General Paulino Santos</em></strong>, 2000; <strong><em>Kagat sa T&rsquo;nalak</em></strong> (Biting the T&rsquo;nalak),2004; and <strong><em>Ibong <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/111\"><strong>Adarna</strong></a>: Sa Muling Paglipad</em></strong> (Adarna Bird: New Journey), 2007. In 1996, Kahayag decided to veer away from using the movements of the Tboli, Blaan, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, and study the everyday movements of the Visayan migrants in Cotabato. It chose contemporary dance as a way of exploring multiculturalism and complementing the different dance backgrounds of its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the late 1990s to 2009, Kahayag was the most visible organization in Mindanao working with the Provincial Government of South Cotabato in holding the Mindanao National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>Modern Dance</strong></a> Competition, which began in 2001. The competition started out as the Mindanao Modern Dance Competition with a meager budget but was later given more financial support by the Provincial Government. On its third year, the competition became a Mindanao national competition that accepted entries from all over the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, Kahayag with its contemporary dances, together with the Me&rsquo;dal Kolon Datal Dance and Theatre Ensemble, with its folk, tribal, and ballroom dances, the Cybercrew with its contemporary and hip-hop dances, and the Tboli Performing Arts with its traditional Tboli dances, came together and strengthened their efforts to carve out a niche for their art in the cultural life of South Cotabato. Together they formed a collective known as the South Cotabato Performing Arts Ensemble, which actively coordinated with the governor&rsquo;s office in making culture and the arts important components of the local government&rsquo;s development program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Kahayag shifted its thrust in 2010 and became the Kahayag Community Cultural Foundation, Inc, a non-stock advocacy organization, Garrovillo set up the Noel Garrovillo Dance Center (NGDC) with a performing arm. While the foundation, with Garrovillo as its chairman of the Board, is an umbrella organization comprised of several dance companies and performers, the NGDC is now on its own, projecting itself as a contemporary dance group that offers jazz, ballroom, hip-hop, and ballet.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ruth Jordana L.

They stage regular performances at the Folk Arts Theater, where the ministry is based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To accomplish their mission of cultural preservation, Kaloob has undertaken field research among over 40 indigenous peoples, recording and notating over a hundred folk dances and musical compositions which, as of 2014, were being organized for publication. Research entails studying the collected works for text and context and archiving for preservation. The works are taught to the ministry&rsquo;s performing artists and staged, as well as used, in church liturgy. Kaloob is unique in its presentation of Filipinized liturgical services by utilizing Philippine folk dance and music to reach out to their congregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998, Kaloob was appointed as the resident dance company of the yearlong Expo Pilipino, a celebration of the Philippine Centennial where the group gave more than 1,400 performances. Kaloob was also the official representative of the Philippines to the 2012 Lefkas and Earthdancers International Dance Festivals in Greece.Kaloob mounts productions all over the Philippines and has performed in Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. It has &ldquo;daughter&rdquo; companies inSaudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Canada, and the United States of America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, the group staged <strong><em>Kalooban: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a>ness of the Filipino Soul in Dance</em></strong> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>, seeking to present a new treatment of the traditional suites in Philippine folk dances by categorizing the dances according to themes. For instance, all dances that featured fire were presented together, and all choreographies that employed the use of bamboo poles from north to south of the archipelago were all in one suite. The goal was to show strong commonalities among the different groups separated by geography and religion, hoping to emphasize national unity.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Josefina B.

Kane was the daughter of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> and Ethel Kane. She grew up in Paracale, Camarines Norte, where her father was an engineer in the mining industry. She studied at St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College and the American School, and pursued premedical studies in Pomona College, San Francisco, USA. She took ballet under Katrina Makarova of the Imperial Russian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a>, now the Kirov, who left Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution and came to Manila in 1924. During her university years in America, Kane continued her dance studies under Martha Thalberg, Norma Gould, and Ernest Belcher. She returned to the Philippines in 1934 and founded her own ballet school (at first with Janet Miles) that later adopted a graded system. During World War II, she was kept in a concentration camp at the University of Santo Tomas. After the war, she reopened her School of Classic Dance. Later she also taught at the University of the Philippines and Far Eastern University. In 1950, she trained further in London at the Royal Academy of Dancing with Claude Newman, and worked with Kathleen Crofton and Harold Turner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She worked as choreographer and teacher in the Philippines from the 1950s to the late 1960s.

It has since been in use in the CCP Dance School and other ballet schools in Metro Manila, Visayas, and Mindanao. The first volume was updated in 2011 with Violeta Velasco as coauthor and Vibal Press as publisher. Its widespread use has been facilitated by workshops given by Radaic, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2499\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2500\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2501\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2502\"><strong>Noordin Jumalon</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>, and NBS Examiners trained by her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For her extensive work in dance, Radaic was given numerous awards: the Mariang Maya Award by the UP Sigma Delta Phi sorority in 1985; the Patnubay ng Kalinangan at Sining by the City of Manila in 1988; the President&rsquo;s Award by the Royal Academy of Dance in the UK in 1996; the CCP Centennial Honor for the Arts and a centennial citation from the University of Santo Tomas, both in 1999; and the Outstanding Alumna in the Arts by the UP and the Gawad CCP Award for Dance by the CCP, both in 2008.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Davao City 28 Sep 1957. Dancer, choreographer, teacher. Locsin is the daughter of Jose Severino Locsin and Carmen Dakudao, a pioneering ballet teacher in Davao. Her sister, Bing Locsin, was a tap dancer and jazz teacher in Los Angeles, who later moved to Davao. She received her degree in English from the Ateneo de Davao University, 1979, and her master of arts in dance from the Ohio State University, USA. She first trained with her mother in Davao at the Locsin Dance Workshop where she later taught and became artistic director of the Locsin Dance Ensemble. She was dance director of the Terpsichoreans in Ateneo de Davao and has taught in the faculty of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) Dance School, the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Tap Center. She served as dance consultant to the Philippine Educational Theatre Association and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\"><strong>Tanghalang Pilipino</strong></a>. In 1990, Locsin became Artistic Director of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a> (BP) II. In 1994-96, she became artistic director of the main company, and continued to be chief choreographer until 1999. Today, it is in her mother Carmen&rsquo;s studio in Davao that Locsin continues her own vocation to nurture and train choreographers from the regions through her Mulihok Dance Workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1986, she gave a solo choreographer&rsquo;s concert titled <strong><em>Female Moves</em></strong> with selected dancers from Manila and Davao. It premiered <strong><em>Only a Woman</em></strong> using video-film and was about a woman&rsquo;s qualities and life cycle; <strong><em>La Lupa</em></strong> (The She-Wolf) all to sound effects and based on a story by Giovanni Verga; and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/133\"><strong>Dabaw</strong></a></em></strong> based on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a> belief regarding the solar eclipse as a monster eating the sun, the symbol for the terrorism in Davao. It also premiered <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a></em></strong> in the Philippines which was staged for the Petit Ballet Theatre in Amsterdam in 1987. Her <strong><em>Ismagol</em></strong> and <strong><em>Bagobo</em></strong>, both in 1990, launched BP II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her other works include <strong><em>Carmen</em></strong>, 1977; <strong><em>Teresa</em></strong>,about Santa Teresa of Avila, 1981; <strong><em>Ang Kapalit</em></strong> (The Substitute), 1981/1982, her master&rsquo;s thesis about Gabriela Silang; <strong><em>Kulam</em></strong> (Witchcraft) for the Metropolitan Dance Theatre, 1991; <strong><em>Moslem</em></strong> for UP and BP and <strong><em>Moriones</em></strong> for the CCP Dance School, both in 1991; <strong><em>Roll Over, Beethoven</em></strong> for BP II and <strong><em>Paglalakbay</em></strong> (Journey), 1992, for the <strong><em>Pas de Deux Program</em></strong>, a joint concert of BP II and Le Jeune Ballet de France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1992, she collaborated with composer/singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\"><strong>Joey Ayala</strong></a> and librettist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\"><strong>Al Santos</strong></a> to produce the much-acclaimed full-length work, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong> (Enchantress). With this apparent focus on indigenous Philippine tradition, its beliefs and rituals rendered in a modern dance idiom, Locsin&rsquo;s works were described as &ldquo;neo-ethnic.&rdquo; She continued to create works in this style such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/121\"><strong>Babalyan</strong></a></em></strong> which won second place in the 1993 Tokyo International Choreography Competition; the solos <strong><em>Taong Talangka</em></strong> (Man-Crab)and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1277\"><strong>Salome</strong></a></em></strong>,which won for Camille Ordinario the 2nd place in the 6th Concours International de la Danse, Paris, 1994; <strong><em>Dalagang Filipina</em></strong> (Filipina Maiden),1995; and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></a></em></strong>,about the mythical hero in the Panayanon epic <strong><em>Hinilawod</em></strong> for the Philippine High School for the Arts, 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin&rsquo;s <strong><em>Elias</em></strong>,1995, about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo;s character Elias in the novel <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></em></strong>,and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/160\"><strong>La Revolucion Filipina</strong></a></em></strong> (The Philippine Revolution),1996, about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\"><strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong></a>, placed her in the ranks of some of the major choreographers of her time. Aside from these, she also created her versions of Western classical works such as <strong><em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong>,1994, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/185\"><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></a></em></strong>, 1997, <strong><em>Medea</em></strong>,1995, and <strong><em>Four Last Songs</em></strong>,1999, choreographed to Richard Strauss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Locsin Dance Workshop in Davao, she created more intimate works for smaller ensembles, some of which are cochoreographies under her direction. Works produced in Davao include the 30-minute solo <strong><em>Balyan</em></strong> (Shaman), <strong><em>Sayaw sa Labi</em></strong> (Dance of the Other),2006, co-choreographed with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2476\"><strong>Gaye Galiluyo</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2586\"><strong>Georgette Sanchez</strong></a>; <strong><em>Sayaw Sabel</em></strong> (Dance of Sabel),2010, inspired by visual artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\"><strong>BenCab</strong></a>&rsquo;s iconic &ldquo;Sabel,&rdquo; as a reinvention of <strong><em>Noli Me Tangere&rsquo;</em></strong> s&ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong></a>&rdquo;; and the <strong><em>Alay sa Puno</em></strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>te to Trees)four-part series which consists of <strong><em>Ugat</em></strong> (Root),2010, <strong><em>Dahon</em></strong> (Leaf),2012, <strong><em>Puno</em></strong> (Tree),2012, in collaboration with Gaye Galiluyo and Georgette Sanchez, and <strong><em>Sanga</em></strong> (Branch),2013, featuring the choreography of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2478\"><strong>Biag Gaongen</strong></a> in collaboration with Krisbelle Paclibar and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2517\"><strong>Sonny Locsin</strong></a>. The last is her tribute to the vanishing trees of her native Davao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For her efforts, Locsin has received the following awards and recognition: the Hiyas ng Lahi Award, from the Dance Alliance and National Choreography Endeavors, as well as the CAPA Award, Outstanding Alumnus from the Philippine Women&rsquo;s College in Davao City, both in 1992; the Blue Knight Award, Outstanding Alumnus In the Field of Dance from the Ateneo de Davao University, the Prince Takamado Award as well as a silver medal in the Tokyo International Choreography Competition, both in 1993; the Araw ng Maynila Award Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan given by the city of Manila in 1994; a Special Philippine Centennial Citation from the City of Davao in 1998; the Datu Bago Award from the City of Davao in 2000; a Mindanawan Art and Culture Citation, awarded by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\"><strong>Sining Kambayoka</strong></a> Ensemble, Mindanao State University and the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as well as the Pilak Award Para sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1288\"><strong>Serbis</strong></a>yong Pangkultura, Sining, at Komunidad, given in celebration of the 25th Anniversary of the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program, both in 2004; the Gawad Buhay Award in the categories of Outstanding Original Choreography and Outstanding Production for <strong><em>La Revolucion</em></strong> from Philstage in 2008; the Kamindanawan Award given by the Mindanao Commission on Women, as well as the Gawad Buhay Award in the categories of Outstanding Original Choreography and Outstanding Production for <strong><em>Encantada</em></strong> fromPhilstage, all in 2011; the Gawad CCP Para sa Sining in 2013; and the Gawad Tanglaw ng Lahi, given by the Ateneo de Manila University in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her book Philippine <strong><em>Neo-Ethnic Choreography: A Creative Process</em></strong> published by the University of Santo Tomas in 2012 won the Alfonso T.

Manila 23 Jun 1973. Dancer and choreographer. Ernest is the only son of Raynaldo Mandap and Cecilla Sarino. He started his dance training at the Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3098\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\"><strong>Metropolitan Theater</strong></a></strong></a> under Bing Locsin and Teta Sugay of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> Tap Center at age 9. At 14, he started taking classes in classical ballet with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2499\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2500\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2501\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2502\"><strong>Noordin Jumalon</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2542\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Morgan</strong></a>. With the Cultural Center of the Philippine&rsquo;s Dance School (CCP-DS), he also took modern dance classes with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\"><strong>Agnes Locsin</strong></a> and Norman Walker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mandap belonged to the first batch of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a> (BP) II. As part of the junior company, Mandap performed in landmark works such as Locsin&rsquo;s <strong><em>Moriones</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2519\"><strong>Jojo Lucila</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>I, Judas</em></strong>; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\"><strong>Denisa Reyes</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sa</em></strong><strong><em>Ugoy ng Duyan</em></strong> (As the Cradle Rocks) and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/171\"><strong>Muybridge Frames</strong></a></em></strong> from 1988 to 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mandap went to Paris, France, to join the Jeune Ballet de France in 1991. There he was able to work with choreographers R&eacute;gine Chopinot, Bertrand d&rsquo;At, Redha, Ivonice Satie, and Claude Brumachon whom Mandap followed to the Centre Chor&eacute;graphique National de Nantes (CCNN) in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mandap stayed with CCNN under Claude Brumachon and Benjamin Lamarche for 21 years. He was featured in the choreographies <strong><em>Nina, Emigrants</em></strong> (Immigrants), <strong><em>Les Avanlanches</em></strong> (Avalanches), <strong><em>Una Vita</em></strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Life), <strong><em>Aventure Extraordinaire</em></strong> (Extraordinary Adventure), <strong><em>Humain Dite-Vous</em></strong> (The Human Called You), and <strong><em>Hotel Central</em></strong>.Mandap rose up the ranks from company member to eventually become rehearsal master, restager, and assistant director. His position in the prestigious company brought pride to the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brumachon and Lamarche allowed him to collaborate with other artists. In 1999, he cofounded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> Esther Aumatell and was its Assistant Director until 2013. The gentle and thorough style of Aumatell was a welcome change and good compliment to Mandap&rsquo;s syncopatic, angular Brumachon technique. He took part in all the productions of Aumatell, and gave workshops and master classes for children, amateur dancers, and professionals. He also choreographed and performed in Germany from 2010 to 2011 with artists such as Anna-Maria Besnier Bayon, Bianca Sere Pulungan, and Fang-Yu Shen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, Mandap appeared in the highly acclaimed Belgian production of <strong><em>Peter Pan</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Never Ending Story</em></strong> as one of the lost boys. The musical spectacle introduced new technologies for visual projections and sound manipulation. He collaborated with Philippe Jamet for the project <strong><em>Une Heure au Palais</em></strong> (One Hour in the Palace), which premiered in France, 2014, and participated in <strong><em>Bodies in Urban Spaces</em></strong> with Willi Dorner, which was performed at Le Mouvement, the 12th Swiss <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>Sculpture</strong></a> Exhibition in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland, also in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Mandap visits the Philippines, he connects with dance companies and dance schools. His choreographies have been included in the programs of Ballet Philippines (BP), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2405\"><strong>Ballet Manila</strong></a> (BM), Airdance, and various dance schools in Metro Manila, most notably <strong><em>Reve</em></strong> (Dream)for BM, 2010; <strong><em>Breathing Space</em></strong> for Airdance,2012; and <strong><em>Zebra</em></strong> for BP, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was given a Parangal ng Bayan award by Senator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5707\"><strong>Vicente Sotto</strong></a> in 1994. He also won the Florence Gould Foundation award, a special jury prize, for a solo that premiered at the Paris International Dance Competition held at the Theatre Champs-Elys&eacute;es in 1998.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Clarissa Cecilia Mijares-Ramos</strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Composed of eight male and female dancers, the Manunubli are acknowledged master artists and inheritors of the subli, a Maytime tradition that mixes dance, poetry, theater, prayer-devotion, celebration, and music. The Manunubli is headed by the female<em>matremayo</em>and their male partners. They usually perform on 2 May on the occasion of the<em>salubong</em>,or welcoming, of the Mahal na Poong Santa Cruz, patron of many towns in Batangas. They also perform during weddings, baptisms,<em>floresdeMayo</em>, thanksgiving, and other religious festivals. Performers come from Pook Agoncillo as well as from the different barrios of Bauan&mdash;San Vicente, Manalupang, Sinturisan, San Diego, Nangkaan, Luklok, and San Agustin. Training is rigid as the performers are required to achieve precision, discipline, and the refinement of form that a subli performance entails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1988 and 1989, the Batangas City government sponsored a subli competition where both the young and the old of Bauan participated. As most of the Manunubli are already well past adulthood, the competition signalled the growing interest of the younger generation of Bauan to keep the subli tradition alive. The older members of Manunubli continue to oversee the dancing of the subli among the young in Batangas. At the opening of the annual subli competition in Batangas, they dance to show early performances of the subli. They continue to influence the young teachers and dancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ManunublingSinala received the Gawad CCP Para sa Sining in 1991.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4839\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4840\"><strong>Elmer L.

Legazpi, Albay 16 Jun 1938, d. 21 Dec 2006. Choreographer, dancer, scholar. National Artist for Dance. The son of Praxedes Obusan, a physician, and Josefina Arevalo, a music teacher, Obusan held degrees in marine biology and cultural anthropology from the University of the Philippines. He taught briefly at the Aklan National School of Fisheries before joining the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>hanPhilippineDance<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in 1964. He was one of the dancers of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a>, but his main responsibility for the group was to record and document the dances of the various indigenous groups in the Philippines. After a few years and finding the company&rsquo;s choreography too stylized and unable to contain his strong desire to promote the country&rsquo;s indigenous dances in their natural form, he decided to establish his own dance group. On 21 Sep 1972, the RamonObusanFolkloricGroup (ROFG) was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through ROFG, Obusan was able to mount folk dance productions based on his painstaking research in traditional folkways from Aparri to Jolo, Sulu. Actual movement patterns, costumes, and music were used, even as the dances were performed on stage. His productions include full-length presentations, notably <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/63\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/157\"><strong>Kayaw</strong></a></strong></a> &rsquo;68</em></strong> and <strong><em>Kayaw &rsquo;74</em></strong>, <strong><em>RITWAL: Rare and Unpublished</em></strong>, <strong><em>Maynila</em></strong> (Manila), 1989; <strong><em>Noon Po sa Amin</em></strong> (The Way It Was), 1991; <strong><em>Under ASEAN Skies</em></strong>, 1992; <strong><em>Mystique Asia</em></strong>, 1994; <strong><em>The</em></strong><strong><em>Rare and Unpublished Dances</em></strong> series, <strong><em>I and II</em></strong>, 1991, and <strong><em>III</em></strong>, 1995; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1479\"><strong>Obra Maestra</strong></a></em></strong>, a collection of his major works, 2001; and <strong><em>Vamos a Belen</em></strong> (Let Us Go to Bethlehem), 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2006. He collaborated in various film projects, among them <strong><em>Banawe</em></strong>,1975, <strong><em>Waywaya</em></strong>, 1982, <strong><em>Hubad na Gubat</em></strong> (Naked Forest), mid-1980s, <strong><em>American Ninja</em></strong>,1985, and <strong><em>The King and the Emperor</em></strong>,1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was able to bring ROFG to international festivals and expositions in over 20 countries in Asia, America, and Europe. His dance group also toured the Philippines extensively and was finally made a resident company for folk dance by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) in 1987. Outside of his own dance group, Obusan was also able to choreograph and direct for some 45 dance groups, notably the Nayong Pilipino Dance Troupe, Larawan Dance Company, St. Anne Dance Company, and Xavier Dance Society of Cagayan de Oro; and over <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1096\"><strong>100</strong></a> productions nationwide&mdash;dance concerts, pageants, festivals, special events, competitions, exhibits, television, movies, and video-films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from staging productions, Obusan continued studying and documenting the culture of various less well-known Philippine indigenous groups. He also researched on the Polynesian culture of Fiji, Samoa, Tahiti, and New Zealand, and gave lectures, demonstrations, and workshops worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two documentaries he directed for the <strong><em>Tuklas Sining</em></strong> series won awards in France: the grand prize, Prix de Reportage for <strong><em>Sayaw: A Video Documentary on Philippine Dance</em></strong>, 1990, and Special Mention, Grand Prix International Video-Dance for <strong><em>Sayaw: A Video Documentary on Philippine Ethnic Dance</em></strong><strong>,</strong> 1992. He also directed <strong><em>Sayaw: A Video Documentary on the Spanish Influence in Philippine Dance</em></strong> and <strong><em>Dulaan: A Video Documentary on Philippine Ethnic Theater</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Obusan was an officer of the PhilippineFolkDanceSociety and became a consultant for UNESCO where he was cited for his achievements in research. For his great contributions in the preservation and promotion of folk dances in its pure form, he received various awards such as the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the City of Manila in 1992, the Gawad CCP Para sa Sining in 1993, the CCP Centennial Honors for the Arts given to 100 artists in 1999, and the Mayor&rsquo;s Award for Excellence in the Arts from the City of Pasay in 2005. The most prestigious award, the National Artist for Dance, was bestowed on him in Jun 2006 by the Philippine government, a few months before he passed away.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Paul G. del Rosario and Basilio Esteban S.

Jolo, Sulu 24 Jul 1917 d. 15 Jul 2005. Poet, playwright, composer, visual artist, scenic and costume designer, pianist, cultural historian. National Artist for Dance. She is the second child of pioneer physicians Sixto Orosa and Severina Luna, and the elder sister of critic Rosalinda Orosa. She was married to Benjamin Goquingco. They had three children, two of whom&mdash;Rachelle and Regina&mdash;are dancers. Orosa-Goquingco graduated valedictorian of her high school class, and finished bachelor of science in education, summa cum laude, at St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College. She took graduate courses in theater craft, drama, and music at Columbia University and Teachers College in New York City, USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Her early ballet training was under Lilia Lopez, Epifania Rodriguez, and LuvaAdameit. She took professional and teacher&rsquo;s courses at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Russe de Monte Carlo, coming under the tutelage of Hilda Butsova, Thalia Mara, Anatole Vilzak, and Madame Ludmilla. National Artist in Dance FranciscaReyes-Aquino was also her mentor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1934, at the age of 17, she started her major dance experiments and, in 1939, was the only dancer on the First Cultural Mission to Japan. That same year, she produced <strong><em>Circling the Globe</em></strong>, and a year later, <strong><em>Dance Panorama</em></strong>. In 1940 she created <strong><em>The Elements</em></strong>, a ballet choreographed with commissioned music, and <strong><em>Sports</em></strong>, featuring cheerleaders, a tennis match, and a basketball game. A year later, she choreographed the first Philippine folkloric ballet, <strong><em>Trend: Return to the Native</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, she organized the Philippine Ballet where she brought to life Maria Clara, the leper, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong></a>, Elias, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1277\"><strong>Salome</strong></a>&mdash;all characters in Rizal&rsquo;s novel <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></em></strong> (Touch Me Not). Her <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/173\"><strong>Noli Dance Suite</strong></a></em></strong>, 1956, including the pieces &ldquo;Maria Clara and the Leper&rdquo; and &ldquo;Asalto for Maria Clara&rdquo; were among the first few choreographies revolving around the novel. In 1958 she founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2468\"><strong>Filipinescas Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orosa-Goquingco was inclined not only to classical ballet but also to Indian and Spanish, as well as modern, dance. She is noted for her courage in breaking traditions in dance despite public indifference. Her other important works include <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/202\"><strong>Vinta</strong></a>!</em></strong><strong><em>Morolandia</em></strong> (choreographed in 1938), <strong><em>Festival in Maguindanao</em></strong> (depicting a Muslim royal wedding), <strong><em>Eons Ago: The Creation</em></strong> (depicting Philippine legends of the creation of the world and of the first man and woman), all forming part of her <strong><em>Filipinescas:Philippine Life,Legend,andLoreinDance</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Miner&rsquo;s Song</em></strong>. Inevitably her innovations revolutionized the folkdances. <strong><em>The Bird and the Planters</em></strong> is the first weaving together of the various rice-planting sequences, climaxed by a new version of the <strong>tinikling</strong> where the dancer personifies the<em>tikling</em>bird. It was the first to utilize bamboo poles to actually catch the bird, the first to use a double-time finale and breathtakingly rapid turns while the dancer hops in and out of the bamboo poles. Orosa-Goquingco&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tribal</em></strong>, about the death of a warrior, is the first dance composition in the Mountain Province-dance style. Other works along the same line are &ldquo;Ang Antipos&rdquo; (The Flagellant), &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>Salubong</strong></a>&rdquo; (Meeting), and &ldquo;Pabasa&rdquo; (Reading of the<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><strong>Pasyon</strong></a></strong></a></em>)&mdash;all dance sequences celebrating Philippine lenten practices. Philippine games such as<em>palo sebo</em>,<em>sipa</em>, and<em>juego de anillo</em>were depicted in <strong><em>Easter Sunday Fiesta</em></strong>. Orosa-Goquingco is also remembered for her transmutation into dance theater of the cockfight, the<em>asalto</em>, and the fiestas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, under her own name and pen name (Cristina Luna), she has been published by the Philippine Cultural Foundation and Philippine periodicals, by <strong><em>Arts of Asia</em></strong> (Hong Kong), <strong><em>Enciclopedia dello Spettacolo</em></strong> (Rome, Italy), and <strong><em>Grove&rsquo;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians</em></strong>. She is the author of a history of Philippine dance, <strong><em>DancesoftheEmeraldIsles</em></strong>, 1980, and of the popular one-act play, <strong><em>Her Son, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a></em></strong>.Her critical essays are compiled in a collection titled <strong><em>Curtain Call: Selected Reviews</em></strong><strong><em>1957-2000</em></strong>, published in 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orosa-Goquingco is also known as &ldquo;Mother of Philippine Theater Dance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dean of Filipino Performing Arts Critics.&rdquo; She became the honorary chair of the Association of Ballet Academies of the Philippines (ABAP) and a founding member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine Ballet Theatre</strong></a> (PBT), 1987.

Moscow, Russia 10 May 1953. Teacher, choreographer, dancer. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2552\"><strong>Anatoly Panassiukov</strong></a> has been the ballet master of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\"><strong>Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Theatre</strong></a> (PBT) since 1995. He is the son of Peter Panassiukov and Maria Evceeva. Divorced from his wife, he has one daughter and two grandchildren.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He enrolled in folk dance classes at the local Arts Center in Moscow, under former professional ballet dancers. At 9 years old, Panassiukov was encouraged to audition at the Bolshoi ballet school, where he received professional training for eight years. The Bolshoi Ballet regularly invited Panassiukov and some of his classmates to perform in the season productions; his first as a little tavern boy in <strong><em>Don Quixote</em></strong>. Upon graduating with a cum laude, he performed a few years with the Bolshoi, but left to join the Theater Stanislavsky, where he became a featured soloist and eventually principal dancer. After seven years, he followed his mentor, Naoum Azarin, who was a cousin of prima ballerina Maya Plisetskaya, when Azarin transferred to Moscow Classical Ballet. Panassiukov danced as a principal for 15 years, alongside Irek Mukhamedov, Galina Schlyapina, and Vladimir Malakhov.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While on tour in the United States, Panassiukov&rsquo;s friend Valentina Kozlova invited him to dance with her at the Hartford Ballet in Connecticut. It was here that PBT artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2422\"><strong>Gener Caringal</strong></a> asked Kozlova for recommendations for a ballet master, and Kozlova thought it a good opportunity for Panassiukov. He, however, turned down the first invitations, only accepting after several tries over the span of a month. His first year in the Philippines was a trial period, but despite the difficulty of the language barrier, he decided to stay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dancers who were in PBT from 1995 to the present have undergone intensive training with Panassiukov. His unorthodox approach to class has strengthened many dancers&rsquo; stamina, ballon, and aplomb. Among the dancers who owe their development to Panassiukov are Faye Abigail Tan, Jared Tan, Tara Ferrer, Joan Ayap, Alvin Aficionado, Nino Guevarra, Mark Joseph Pineda, and Lobreza Pimentel. He also arranged for Russian dancers Iouri Vyskubenko and Andrei Roslotsev to join PBT in 1997. Several dance schools in Metro Manila have invited Panassiukov as guest teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As ballet master of PBT, Panassiukov manages daily rehearsals of the company and has worked with artistic directors Caringal, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2418\"><strong>Julie Borromeo</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2496\"><strong>Ronilo Jaynario</strong></a> during their tenures. He restaged several evening-length ballets, including <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong>, 2001, 2005, and 2010; <strong><em>Don Quixote</em></strong>, 2000 and 2001; <strong><em>Hunchback of Notre Dame</em></strong>, 2003; <strong><em>La Bayadere</em></strong> (The Temple Dancer), 2004; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a></em></strong>, 1997 and 2006; and the divertissement from <strong><em>Paquita</em></strong>, 1997 and 2010. In 2005, he choreographed <strong><em>Classical Symphony</em></strong> to Sergei Prokofiev&rsquo;s opus, which has become a staple in PBT&rsquo;s repertoire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He has also appeared as a character soloist in PBT productions, namely as the father of Kitri in <strong><em>Don Quixote</em></strong>, alternately the stepmother and stepsister of <strong><em>Cinderella</em></strong>, the King in <strong><em>Raymonda</em></strong>, the Duke in <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong>, the mother of Swanilda in <strong><em>Coppelia</em></strong>, the nurse and Lord Capulet in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/185\"><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></a></em></strong>, and the Spanish general in Gener Caringal&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/114\"><strong>Andres KKK</strong></a></em></strong>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong>Ballet Philippines</strong></a> invited Panassiukov to perform as Madam Simeona in their restaging of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2542\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Morgan</strong></a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/118\"><strong>Ang Pilya</strong></a></em></strong> (Naughty Girl, based on <em><strong>La Fille Mal Gardee</strong> </em>) in 2004.

In 1958 the troupe was formally named and organized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PBFDT&#39;s repertory portrays a panorama of Philippine life and culture through wedding and courtship dances, martial dances, occupational dances, festival dances, and some comic dances from tribal and various ethnic groups, as well as Western-influenced dances of the Spanish period. A distinct characteristic of the group is that it continues the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\"><strong>Francisca Reyes-Aquino</strong></a> by presenting her published folkdances as well as newly researched ones in a simple, precise, and instructional way. This mode stems from Angeles-Belmonte&rsquo;s affiliation with Reyes-Aquino in the University of the Philippines <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a> and Dance Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1959 the PBFDT represented the Philippines in the First Floating Exposition which toured 10 countries in the Asia-Pacific. In 1963 it participated in the First Southeast Asian Cultural Festival in Singapore and Malaysia. In 1965 the troupe represented Manila in the Royal Orchid Revue in Bangkok, Thailand, and fulfilled a command performance before Cambodia&rsquo;s Prince Norodom Sihanouk and his queen mother. In the same year, it was adjudged the best in the Pageant of Asia Spectacular in Sydney, Australia. This was followed by concerts in Malaysia and Singapore in 1966. In 1968 it went on an eight-month world tour as official ambassador of goodwill. For 65 years, the group has performed in Asia, Europe, and North America.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon Angeles-Belmonte&rsquo;s retirement from Philippine Normal College, the troupe became a foundation and is now no longer attached to the university. PBFDT is now administered by its director Eugene Ticzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two PBFDT&rsquo;s most prestigious national awards are the Presidential Cultural Award, 1959, the Philippine Presidential Medal of Merit Award for the advancement of Philippine culture, and the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan (Sayaw) Award, both in 1971. Among the many awards received by the troupe are, the silver trophy from Hari Wanita, Federation of Men&rsquo;s Club of Malaysia; the Hiyas ng Pilipinas Award, 1964, from the Board of Travel and Tourist Industry; recognitions and medals from the Cambodian Government and the City Council of the City of Los Angeles as Cultural Ambassadors of Goodwill and Friendship, 1965, and Cultural Ambassadors of the Philippines, 1968, respectively; and the Most Outstanding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Group from the Bank of Commerce, 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PBFDT continues to be one of strongest companies in the country and has contributed to the strengthening of folk dance education and tradition. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Larry A.

Known as the Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Group before 1969, the group&rsquo;s repertoire was developed by Maria Batoon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2446\"><strong>Salud Datoc</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2570\"><strong>Francisca Reyes-Aquino</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1969, ReynaldoAlejandro changed the name to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2556\"><strong>Philippine Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> of New York</strong></a>, and for 12 years the artistic orientation was stylized and synthesized, incorporating other dance idioms.

Among the many dance teachers of the company were Rebecca Estepa, Leo Ona, Joe de Guzman, Deo Aclo, and Chito Grajo III.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subsequently, Rebecca Estepa, a student of Reyes-Aquino, became the group&rsquo;s artistic leader and works of Reyes-Aquino were reintroduced to the company. Later, Orlin Eijansantos who became the company&rsquo;s resident director and choreographer, was assisted by Rolly Postadan and Princess Reymundo, dance master and dance mistress, respectively. Ramon de Luna served as president and managed the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although committed to performing dances and songs embodying the Philippine&rsquo;s rich indigenous, Hispanic, and Muslim cultures, the company has included modern dance, jazz, dance-dramas, and various dance styles in its repertoire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its founding, the company has performed throughout the United States, with some of its members joining the international All Nations Dance Company on occasional tours of Europe and the Middle East. It performed at the New York World&rsquo;s Fair in 1964 and 1965, and over the years, at the Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall, Town Hall, Asia House, Broadway theaters, the Florence Gould Auditorium, the United Nations, the New York Dance Festival, the Felt Forum of the Madison Square Garden, the New York City Parks, and the Garden State Arts. The company also performed at the Havana University, Cuba.

Ethnic groups were invited to perform at the Rizal Memorial Complex. She also began dance clinics where teachers from various Luzon provinces met every Sunday to learn the latest dances discovered through her researches. The clinic also served as a clearing house on issues of interpretation, costumes, music, and dance steps. In 1953, then PFDS president Carmen Adevoso, established regional chapters; today, PFDS has chapters across the country. Another significant activity of the Society was the <strong><em>Hiyas ng Lahi</em></strong> (Treasures of the Race) in 1959-60 where school-based dance troupes presented their repertoire of Philippine folk dances. It also had special demonstrations and clinics for visiting foreigners such as members of the International Recreation Association, the Folk Dance Society of America, and the Peace Corps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a time, the Society became inactive but was revived in 1975 through the initiative of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2571\"><strong>Lucrecia Reyes-Urtula</strong></a>, then artistic director for dance of the Folk Arts Theater. She invited some of the old members to help establish the new Society. As its main activity, it conducted folk dance workshops, the first being held at Philippine Normal College. Later, they were held at the Folk Arts Theater, in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP) and the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS). Participants reached nearly 700 in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, PFDS held its 33rd National Folk Dance Workshop where 11 dances were introduced such as Negros Oriental&rsquo;s <strong>inagta</strong>; Bulacan&rsquo;s wedding ritual <strong>desposorio</strong>; Ilocos Norte&rsquo;s <strong>innalisan</strong>; Marinduque&rsquo;s <strong>aetana</strong>; and Moncada, Tarlac&rsquo;s <strong>la jota Moncada</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presidents of PFDS since the 1950s include Maria Javier, Carmen F.

It finally ended with the transfer of Sala-Villarica&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2427\"><strong>Cebu Ballet Center</strong></a> to Nicolas Paca&ntilde;a and Gregory Aaron in 2006, who renamed the school <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2427\"><strong>Ballet Center Cebu</strong></a>.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by S.

Its identity lies in its careful rendering of folk art and culture onstage. Its repertoire is based on the extensive research of Obusan, a former member of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>hanPhilippineDance<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> and a cultural anthropologist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more than 40 years, ROFG has documented and performed the rituals of more than 50 ethnolinguistic groups in the country. Its flagship dance production, <strong><em>Unpublished Dances of the Philippines</em></strong>, is a series of dance productions that present little-known dances and rituals excluded from the standard dance repertoire of other major folk dance troupes. It has more than 20 outstanding full-length Filipino dance suites, including those of the Cordillera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\"><strong>Bagobo</strong></a>, Tboli, Tausug, Maranao, the Aeta, and the Talaandig.

These are comprehensive and faithful presentations of Philippine traditions in rites, music, dances, and mythic and historical panoramas. Often, indigenous groups perform with the group in festivals and expositions abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ROFG has toured extensively, having covered various countries in Asia, the Americas, and Europe since 1974. It has served as the country&rsquo;s cultural ambassadors in various dance festivals and conferences. In 1991, it became the country&rsquo;s official representative to the first joint ASEAN Performing Troupe. In 1994, it was the only Filipino company tasked to perform for six months at the ASEAN Village in Sentosa, Singapore, performing not only Philippine dances but dances of other Asian countries as well. It has so far gone on three successful European tours which included Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, France, Amsterdam, Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Yugoslavia, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Australia in 1987, 1990, and 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ROFG became one of the resident dance companies of the CCP in 1987. Aside from performing, it assists some 50 groups and institutions in choreography, direction, and production design. It also participates in the outreach programs of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\"><strong>Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Society</strong></a> and the CCP by giving lectures and demonstrations on Philippine folk dances and traditions to teachers and students. After the demise of Obusan in 2006, his sister Dulce Obusan assumed directorship of the ROFG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2001, the ROFG was awarded the Sining Kalinangan Award for being an outstanding folk dance company by the City of Manila.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Bocaue, Bulacan 7 Mar 1899. d. Manila 12 Dec 1983. Dancer, choreographer, teacher, researcher. National Artist for Dance. Her parents are Felipe Reyes and Juliana Santos of Tondo, Manila. She married her fellow researcher Ramon Tolentino in 1934, with whom she had a daughter, Celia. She was widowed in 1939. Her second marriage in 1947 was to Serafin Aquino, a PE superintendent in the Bureau of Education. She graduated from the Meisic Primary School, Tondo Intermediate School, 1916 (now Isabelo de los Reyes Elementary School) and at the Manila High School in Tondo, Manila, 1920. From the University of the Philippines (UP), she got her high school teacher&rsquo;s certificate in 1923, and bachelor of science in education in 1924. As a student assistant in Physical Education in UP, she was asked to prepare a presentation of Philippine folk dances for the 1921 Manila Fiesta Carnival where she presented for the first time four dances, <strong>cari&ntilde;osa</strong>, <strong>abaruray</strong>, <strong>salabat</strong>, and <strong>areuana</strong>, based on her field notes from ordinary people who knew the dances. In 1926, she earned a master of arts degree from UP with the thesis &ldquo;Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a>s and Games,&rdquo; a collection arranged specifically for the use of teachers and playground instructors. This study was the beginning of research work spanning the next 45 years of her life. With the support of UP President Jorge Bocobo, she braved mountain trails and treacherous waters all over the Philippines to reach peoples and their dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1929-31 under a UP Fellowship, she worked for a certificate at the Sargent College of Physical Education of Boston University, USA. Returning to the Philippines, she became Physical Education (PE) director for women at UP, 1937-39, and organized the UP <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\"><strong>Folk Song</strong></a> and Dance Club. Reyes-Aquino became PE supervisor of the Bureau of Education in 1939, and organized its folk dance society in 1940. In 1945, she organized the Filipiniana Folk Dance Troupe to perform for American troops in the Philippines. She was appointed PE superintendent of the Department of Education in 1947. In 1949, she founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\"><strong>Philippine Folk Dance Society</strong></a>. She led the <strong><em>Hiyas ng Lahi</em></strong> (Treasures of the Race) program from 1953 to 1959 where college and university troupes held a yearly exhibit of Philippine folk dances to preserve their authenticity as well as to propagate them.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1960 until her retirement, she was the chairman of the Bureau of Public School Cultural Team. She also taught at Centro Escolar University, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></a> College, Philippine Women&rsquo;s University, and National University. Her research works are preserved in books that are used extensively in the Philippines and abroad: <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances and Games</em></strong>, 1927; <strong><em>Philippine National Dances</em></strong>, 1946; <strong><em>Gymnastics for Girls</em></strong>, 1947; <strong><em>Fundamental Dance Steps and Music</em></strong>, 1948; <strong><em>Foreign Folk Dances</em></strong>, 1949; <strong><em>Dances for All Occasions</em></strong>, 1950; <strong><em>Playground Demonstration</em></strong>, 1951; <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances</em></strong> in six volumes, 1951-79; <strong><em>Rhythmic Activities</em></strong>, 1952; and <strong><em>Philippine Folk Dances and Songs</em></strong>, as coauthor, 1966.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reyes-Aquino&rsquo;s work earned her many awards. The first to honor her achievement was Boston University, which conferred on her an honorary doctorate in PE for her pioneering research. Then came the Republic of the Philippines Award of Merit in 1954; an honorary doctorate in humanities from Far Eastern University in 1959; Certificate of Award, UNESCO National Commission of the Philippines in 1959; the Rizal Pro-Patria Award in 1961; the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1962; Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan Award in 1969; a certificate of recognition from the American Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association or YMCA, in 1980, and the Smithsonian Institute and the Asia Society in 1981. She was proclaimed National Artist in 1973. She received the Ulirang Pilipina Award, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2441\"><strong>Dance Education Association of the Philippines</strong></a> in 1998.

Iloilo 29 Jun 1929. d. 4 Aug 1999. National Artist for Dance. Born to a music-loving couple, Col Leon S. Reyes, who encouraged her interest in folkdance and traditions, and Antonia Faustino, daughter of pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceto Faustino, Reyes-Urtula was exposed at an early age to the various indigenous groups in the Philippines because of the constant change in her father&rsquo;s tours of duty. She was married to Dalmacio Urtula Jr with whom she had three children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Baguio she took ballet lessons with a Russian emigre. Later she apprenticed with FranciscaReyes-Aquino. She graduated with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in physical education from the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU), 1950, where she immediately started to teach. She pursued further studies at the Martha Graham School in New York, USA; the Hanayagi School in Japan, 1955; San Francisco State College, 1953; and the Polytechnic University of the Philippines where she got a doctorate in theater management, 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a student and teacher at PWU, she was involved in the Filipiniana Folk Arts Group. In 1955 the group attended the International Festival of Dance and Music in Dacca, Pakistan. That trip spurred the group to enrich its research and performances, and following the example of Reyes-Aquino, made contact with remote indigenous groups. In 1957 the group became the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a>han Folk Arts Center and its performing arm, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/12\"><strong>Bayanihan</strong></a>PhilippineDance<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, with Reyes-Urtula as choreographer and dance director.

Murcia, Negros Occidental 13 Nov 1970. Dancer, choreographer, teacher. The son of former four-time mayor of Murcia, Negros Occidental, Elizalde Paculan Rodrigazo, and retired teacher, Erlinda de la Noche Gico, Rodrigazo was a soloist of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a> where he was known as &ldquo;Wild Man Dwight&rdquo; (Torres) and a &ldquo;livewire character&rdquo; (Saspa). After his third year in college as a Political Science student at the San Sebastian College Manila, he decided to pursue dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bacolod, he received ballet training with Anabele Martinez Cudilla from 1983 to 1986 and Lydia M. Gaston from 1985 to 1986. With the CCP Dance School from 1986 to 1987, he became a Ballet Philippines (BP) II member from 1989 to 1990, and a soloist of BP I from 1991 to 1998. Rodrigazo was featured in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\"><strong>Agnes Locsin</strong></a>&rsquo;s award-winning works, <strong><em>Moriones</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/121\"><strong>Babalyan</strong></a></em></strong>. In 1996, he was awarded a residency grant with the Brumachon Centre Choreographique Natinonale de Nantes in France.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Influenced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2617\"><strong>Edna Vida</strong></a>, Agnes Locsin, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\"><strong>Denisa Reyes</strong></a>, Rodrigazo produced several works for BP. He collaborated with award-winning theater director Anton Juan on <strong><em>Bread of Angels</em></strong>, 1993, and with his peers in 1995&rsquo;s <strong><em>Noche Buena</em></strong>. He also created <strong><em>Bistro Amoranto</em></strong>, a dance series for a 24-hour live band concert, <strong><em>Woman Unbound</em></strong>, 1994, <strong><em>PRESH-AR</em></strong>, 1998, <strong><em>Whimsical</em></strong>, 2010, <strong><em>Moving Two</em></strong>, 2012, and <strong><em>Hardin ng Balo</em></strong> (Garden of the Widow), 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1998, Rodrigazo was a guest artist in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2415\"><strong>Myra Beltran</strong></a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2442\"><strong>Dance Forum</strong></a> and a member of Power Dance from 2000 to 2001, before cofounding E-Dance Theater in 2002. He also founded Airdance shortly after, where he was associate artistic director and chief choreographer until 2006. Since 1995, he has also conducted dance workshops for the NCCA and CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rodrigazo&rsquo;s major works include <strong><em>Clones</em></strong>, 2002, for E-Dance Theater, and <strong><em>Streams</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/150\"><strong>Indios Bravos</strong></a></em></strong> (Brave Natives) for Airdance, both in 2004. In the same year, an excerpt of the latter won for Airdance the &ldquo;Best Young Contemporary Dance Theater Group of the Philippines&rdquo; award during the 3rd Mindanao National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/74\"><strong>Modern Dance</strong></a> Competition. He also choreographed <strong><em>Tsukat Yashua</em></strong> (Passion of Christ), a full-length contemporary work choreographed for Tapestry and Dance Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rodrigazo moved to Bacolod in 2006 with his wife Sigrid Claus and established Dance=Pull School of Performing Arts, which served as the center for the Australian Conservatoire of Ballet examination program in the Visayas from 2011. Through the programs Contemporary Audience Development Program and Composition and Movement Analysis Program (C-MAP), Dance=Pull explores the possibilities of dance by working with groups of different cultural backgrounds in Negros and the rest of the Philippines to raise the level of consciousness of dancers and audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Featured at the WiFi Body Independent Contemporary Dance Festival are his critically acclaimed <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/156\"><strong>Karga Tapas</strong></a></em></strong> (Cut and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>Loa</strong></a>d) in 2008 and the lighter <strong><em>Birds of the Mind</em></strong> in 2009. The former, on the<em>sakada</em>(sugar cane workers) in Negros, embodies Rodrigazo&rsquo;s aesthetics drawn from both his modern and contemporary training, and his Bacolod tableaux. These were followed by <strong><em>Port Links</em></strong>, 2010, <strong><em>Beatles Suite</em></strong>, 2012, and <strong><em>Defi</em></strong>,2013. He describes his choreographic style as &ldquo;directional motivation,&rdquo; which not only articulates how the moderns rebelled against the classical form but also his search for the various possibilities of movements. Such style is what he calls &ldquo;Asian contemporary,&rdquo; a cultural synergy of movements and cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For his commitment to dance education, Rodrigazo was conferred the &ldquo;Artista sang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/864\"><strong>Banwa</strong></a>&rdquo; (Artist of the Town) award in the field of dance by the Province of Negros Occidental, Municipality of Murcia-Murcia Tourism Council, on 24 May 1997.

After World War II, he resumed his studies and was one of the first dancers to tour the Philippines extensively. In 1952 he went to Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow in Massachusetts, USA, and worked with Ted Shawn and Ruth St. Denis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He performed all over Europe as soloist and choreographer in the Viennese company of Kapps and Johannes.

Salvador, <strong><em>Arms Etude</em></strong> to M. Galea, <strong><em>El Greco</em></strong> to Turina, <strong><em>Don Quixote</em></strong> to W. Newmann, and <strong><em>Death and the</em></strong><strong><em>Peacock</em></strong> to Ignoto.

Kalinga musician, dancer, and performance artist. Saclag is also a cultural worker who advocates for the continuity of Kalinga culture in modern contexts. As expected of someone who grew up in a village in which culture was learned face-to-face among kindreds,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4154\"><strong>Alonzo Saclag</strong></a></strong> was exposed to Lubuagan music traditions that are deeply shared collectively and that have indissoluble link to calendrical and life cycle rituals. He learned his particular Kalinga culture by imitation, mastering instrumental music and dance, the latter of which is an essential ingredient in village ceremonies being a profound expression of sociability in a close-knit community.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a passionate advocate of his own cultural heritage, Saclag had extolled members of his community to preserve their traditional material culture, archaeological sites, and even reinvented a new form of <i>bodong</i> (peace pact) in which customary retribution or justice is not applied at the tribal group level but is individually addressed. Clearly a modern subject with an individual consciousness, Saclag&rsquo;s aspiration to move his culture beyond static tradition is manifest is his advocacies. He convinced the provincial government of Kalinga to convert and finance the transformation of an abandoned Capitol Building into a museum of heritage, which is now a branch of the National Museum. Moreover, in 2009, he founded a School of Living Tradition that was partly supported by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He also tirelessly campaigned in schools to press the issue on maintaining a strong ethnic identity despite the modern origin of the institution of formal schooling, so much so that he introduced the practice of children wearing the Kalinga costume during important events like graduation ceremonies and even during the Catholic rite of first communion. Another innovation that was consistently a part of his effort to bolster indigenous expressions has been mission of intensifying the singing of folk songs in Kalinga classrooms and, remarkably, putting up skits and other artistic performances that mix old and new elements in a number of schools. In addition, he aspired for the broadcast of traditional Kalinga music alongside contemporary music in the local radio station.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To concretize his effort in moving his culture in a sustainable manner in modern contexts, he founded the Kalinga Budong Dance Troupe where he teaches the youth their local music and dance. Since this dance company now tours in cities beyond the village, i.e., it now circulates beyond its traditional place of origin, it is envitable that artistic hybridity has resulted in Saclag&rsquo;s projects.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For his artistry, cultural advocacy, and influence, Saclag was conferred the Gawad Manlilikha ng Bayan in 2000. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong> Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

Guillen, then deputy director for dance of the CCP, developed and implemented the school&rsquo;s program for folk dance starting in 1986. In 1992, Victor Emmanuel L. Flor, resident dance faculty, established the SPM composed of folk dance majors. It was named &ldquo;Sanghiyas,&rdquo; from<em>isang</em>and<em>hiyas</em>meaning &ldquo;one gem.&rdquo; Since then, SPM has travelled locally and internationally to showcase the cultural traditions of the Filipinos. They have performed in Taiwan, Italy, Monaco, Belgium, Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Singapore, and Korea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPM joined or facilitated workshops with some of the leading dance groups, like Dagyaw Theater and Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> of Iloilo, Sining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><strong>Kumintang</strong></a></strong></a> of Batangas, UP Dance Company of University of the Philippines (UP) Diliman, CCP Dance School of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2513\"><strong>Leyte Dance Theater</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2514\"><strong>Leyte Kalipayan Dance Company</strong></a>. Through their program called Bisita Guro (Visiting Masters), SPM members and staff meet important personalities in Philippine dance, such as the late National Artist Ramon Arevalo Obusan, Corazon G. I&ntilde;igo, Basilio Esteban Villaruz, Teresita Pil, Jess de Paz, and Larry A. Gabao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPM has continuously performed Filipino folk dances to preserve and promote them. It provides dance students the necessary skills and discipline to empower them as artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When possible, members of SPM train in basic ballet and modern dance and other dance forms like flamenco, hip-hop, and ballroom. They also venture into creative dance, new traditions in folk dance theater, retro folk, and neo-folk with<em>katutubo</em>(indigenous) perspectives. Sanghiyas alumni go into higher education in dance in UP Diliman, De La Salle-College of St. Benilde, and Hong Kong Academy of the Performing Arts, or join dance companies in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, SPM won first prize in the 2013 Sayaw Pinoy Folk Dance Competition among 20 groups in the country.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><strong><em>Written by Josefina B.

She directed SUDT until 1968, after which she migrated to Australia. She attributes her training to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2503\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ta Kane</strong></a> and Ricardo Cassell in the Philippines, and to Ted Shawn&rsquo;s famous Jacob&rsquo;s Pillow in Massachusetts, where Silliman dancer Ted Leyson had also trained. After Jumawan, there came choreographic contributions from Shona MacTavish from 1968 to early 1970s. From New Zealand, MacTavish trained in Central European modern dance called <strong>Ausdruckstanz</strong> (expressive dance). She also choreographed for Dance Theatre Philippines and several interfaith productions in Manila, Cebu, and Dumaguete, and did some field research in ethnic dance in Mindanao. When she left, Gwen Schofield from Australia briefly directed SUDT. Like MacTavish, she was also schooled in Ausdruckstanz through Austrian Gertrude Bodenweiser who had migrated to Australia. (Bodenweiser was the main teacher of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2453\"><strong>Trudl Dubsky-Zipper</strong></a> who, with Kaethe Hauser, brought that school and style to Manila in the 1930s.) In an interview in 1978, Schofield confessed how SUDT&rsquo;s local choreographers were &ldquo;healthily different&rdquo; from her. Among these were Miguel Braganza (now in the US) and the Serion sisters, Luwalhati and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a>. Later becoming directors, the sisters got to be respectively known as Campoy and Arabe by their married names. In those early days, the troupe toured the Visayas and Mindanao, and joined the First National <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Festival in 1976 at the Folk Arts Theater in Manila. Liwayway Serion-Arabe directed SUDT up to 1996, after which the group went moribund. In its active years, it had <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3001\"><strong>Junix Inocian</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2893\"><strong>Lu Decenteceo</strong></a> among its technical directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004, Dean Joseph Basa of the SU College of Performing Arts revived the group. It was renamed SU Kahayag Dance Troupe (SUKDT) and was under the direction of Ronnie Mirabuena, assisted by Swyline de Jesus. It set a folkloric and contemporary dance repertoire. Among these were <strong><em>Tala Na</em></strong>, <strong><em>Biyahe Ta</em></strong> (Let&rsquo;s Go on a Trip), 2005; <strong><em>Sandurot</em></strong> (Unity and Sharing), 2007; <strong><em>Panata</em></strong> (Pledge) on Filipino spirituality, 2007; <strong><em>Mansuba: Sentinel of Paradise</em></strong>,2008, based on Manobo and Inagta (of Negros Oriental) practices. Through those years, SUKDT performed in the Visayas, Bicol, and Mindanao, and joined festivals like the CCP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sari-Saring Sayaw, Sama-Samang Galaw</em></strong> (Varied Dances, Together in Moves). It also joined festivals in Macao, 2006 and Nanning, China, 2007; CCP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pasinaya</em></strong> (Inauguration),2008; and the Contemporary Dance Network&rsquo;s <strong><em>WiFi Body </em></strong> Independent Contemporary Dance Festivalat the CCP, 2010. At the end of 2011, Mirabuena left and Engel Boen Zerna became director up to 2013. Around that time, the group went back to its original name SUDT. In 2014, a new director took over&mdash;Angelo Sayson, former director of Kabilin Dance Troupe of the Negros Oriental State University.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

Considered one of the cultural arms of the Social and Cultural Office of the University, the Palawan Dance Troupe&rsquo;s aims are to develop and showcase the talent of its performers, to explore and expose Palawan&rsquo;s traditions, and to experience learning through music and dance. The troupe&rsquo;s name, &ldquo;Sining Palawan&rdquo; or Palawan Art, conveys its vision for cultural development through folk dance performances. Since its establishment, the group has undergone a series of transformations that has allowed it to achieve the status of &ldquo;Palawan&rsquo;s premiere university-based dance troupe.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group&rsquo;s repertoire consists of indigenous dances in Palawan, countryside dances, and dances from the southern Philippines. Its productions include <strong><em>Kulta</em></strong>,a contraction of<em>kultura</em>(culture),<em>tradisyon</em>(tradition), and<em>antolohiya</em>(anthology), 2004; <strong><em>Saut</em></strong> (Dance), 2007; <strong><em>Pamana</em></strong>,(Heritage/Legacy), 2009; <strong><em>Pagdiriwang</em></strong> (Celebration), 2010; <strong><em>Sining&hellip; Galing!</em></strong> (Art &hellip; Great!), 2011; <strong><em>Pagsilang</em></strong> (Birth), 2011; <strong><em>Naglalakbay</em></strong> (Journey), 2012; and <strong><em>Pagtitipon</em></strong> (Gathering), 2013.

In 2012, the group also performed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>&rsquo; Filipiniana Sunsets at the CCP, a weekly cultural show featuring community-based and school-based folk dance groups.

The following year, the group joined the Philippine Arts Festival held in Palawan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The troupe has participated in competitions. In 2006, it joined the 3rd Philippine Association of State Universities and Colleges (PASUC) National Cultural-Literary Festival in Bulacan, winning 1st runner up in the Maria Clara category and 2nd runner up in the Indigenous dance category of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a>.

Its first artistic director was RamonObusan and among its choreographers is Khayroden &ldquo;Marlon&rdquo; Pangkat. With the return of Maranao religious scholars from the Middle East in the early 1980s, rigid Islamic standards of behavior became the norm in Maranao society. Native songs, dances, and rituals were threatened. Believing this to be contrary to the Islamic ideal of allowing the free flourishing of society, SiningPananadem was organized to save and protect Maranao cultural expressions and heritage. Despite conservative resistance, even harassment, Balt and the group have won regional and national recognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1988, its songs, dances, and ceremonials were documented by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP). In 1989 and 1990, it performed for the CCP&rsquo;s annual <strong><em>Pang-alay</em></strong> festival in Manila. Its programs there were also aired on television. In 1989, it earned a local touring grant from the CCP&rsquo;s outreach and exchange program; it visited communities in Marawi and the rest of Lanao del Sur. In 1990, it conducted lecture-demonstrations in Manila, and, in 1991, toured Luzon and the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was in 1989 that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2597\"><strong>Sining Pananadem</strong></a> gained recognition from the Mindanao State University in Marawi as a performing group under the Office of Cultural Affairs. In 1991, it ventured into the preservation of Maranao music with the Development Education Media Services Foundation of Davao City. Recorded songs from the project were distributed worldwide. The group also helped organize Inandang Fokloric, a dance group under Ismael Cali, and Sowara Maranaw, a choral group under Macaangkos Tocalo. These two serve local artists in different communities in Lanao del Sur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its established repertoire are: <strong><em>Sindao sa Gagawii</em></strong> (on Maranao courtship and lifestyle), <strong><em>Pananadem</em></strong> (remembrance), <strong><em>Kambae</em></strong> (crowning a noble lady), <strong><em>Kapranon</em></strong> (Maranao songs, dances, games, rituals, chants, and music), <strong><em>Sinar</em></strong> (Maranao music fused with Western music), <strong><em>Kariala</em></strong> (feast), <strong><em>Khakawing</em></strong> (wedding), and <strong><em>Kandatu</em></strong> (crowning a king), all staged between 1988 and 1990.In 2015, the troupe performed during the 25th anniversary of the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2407\"><strong>Samo Balt</strong></a>, Basilio Esteban S.

Director, scholar, choreographer. Born to Ricardo Sison and Valeriana Abdon, both of Lingayen, Pangasinan, Sison-Friese graduated from the Philippine Normal School and the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU), major in home economics. She shifted her interest to physical education after training at the National College of Physical Education. She went back to PWU for graduate work. Her master&rsquo;s thesis was on unpublished Philippine folkdances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspired by the work of FranciscaReyes-Aquino, Sison-Friese mingled with the old folk of her home province to learn their dances. Out of many years of study and observation, she wrote a book, <strong><em>Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a>s from Pangasinan</em></strong>,published in 1980. Serafin Aquino, former superintendent of physical education at the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports, introduced the book, saying it opened another dimension in Pangasinan dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sison-Friese was an outstanding teacher of physical education, especially of folk dances, in the city schools of Manila and the National College of Physical Education. After migrating to the United States in the late 1960s, she continued to teach folk dances with unwavering commitment to authenticity. In 1971 she organized the Fil-Am Family Cultural Group in Los Angeles, California. In 1991, on its 20th anniversary, the group gave a grand show with her as overall director and choreographer.In recognition of her efforts to promote Philippine culture in the US, Sison-Friese has been accorded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Tri-Media Group of Companies. She has also received the Meritorious Service Award for the Promotion of Philippine Culture, Merit Award on Children&rsquo;s Dance Group, the Fil-Am Cultural Group&rsquo;s Outstanding Civic Service Award, and a citation from Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2399\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2400\"><strong>Prosperidad M.

During that time, students studied ballet only to gain a social grace and/or to teach ballet. The Cassells recognized that the development of the full potential of Philippine ballet dancers depended on professionalizing ballet. To encourage ballet as a career, it was, and still is, necessary to provide an environment in which not only the wealthy and socially prominent participate, but more importantly, gifted persons dedicated to the art are provided opportunities to dance.

Budapest, Hungary 24 Aug 1912. d. New York 26 Jul 2013. Dancer, teacher, impresario. The son of a stockbroker, he studied ballet in Budapest, toured with his teacher&rsquo;s troupe, and then moved to Paris where he trained under prominent &eacute;migr&eacute; teachers Olga Preobrajenska and Roussane Sarkissian, and in London with Stanislas Idzikowski. He married Ariane Pulver, a Swiss modern dancer, and eventually became an American citizen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines, he taught ballet during the Japanese occupation, and staged and danced in ballets and operatic dances in Manila during World War II. Upon the return of the Americans, Szilard opened an officers&rsquo; club with a bar which he called Blue Elephant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As dancer, he performed with Nora Kaye, Colette <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>Marcha</strong></a>nd, and Sonia Arova worldwide. He presented <strong><em>Swan</em></strong><strong><em>Lake</em></strong>, <strong><em>Sylvia</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Four Seasons</em></strong>, &ldquo;Dance of the Hours&rdquo; from <strong><em>La Gioconda</em></strong>,and <strong><em>The Mad</em></strong><strong><em>Thinker</em></strong>,among others, at the MetropolitanTheater under the auspices of the Volunteer Social Aid Committee. Among his dancers were RemediosdeOteyza, Cecile Yulo-Locsin, Nadine Vantchuran, and ChloeCruz-Romulo. In 1953 he organized Philippine Art Theater for a production called <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a> Philippines</strong></a></em></strong> that stylized Philippine folkdances into a ballet theater presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in New York, in the mid-1950s, he taught ballet, was invited as a guest artist by Komaki Ballet in Japan, created his company that presented French celebrities Colette Marchand and Milorad Miskovitch in their tour of Japan, and established his production outfit in 1954. His <strong><em>West Side Story</em></strong> was the first English-language musical that toured Japan. In 2007, he was behind the production of the same show in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Szilard was not only a prominent impresario in New York but also a personal agent of popular ballet dancers such as Violette Verdy. He brought the New York City Ballet to Manila in 1958, the Martha Graham Dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> in 1974, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in 1977, and Ballet Nuevo Mundo de Caracas, with Filipino dancers ManuelMolina and Gloria Tobilla de la Casa, in 1982. Later, he was the representative of the Martha Graham Dance Company in the United States and eventually became part of the company&rsquo;s board. For 40 years, he maintained close ties with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, booking the company&rsquo;s international performances. Although dealing mostly with American companies, Szilard also handled foreign groups performing in the US such as the Dancers of Bali, Madrid&rsquo;s Ballet Victor, Universal Ballet, and the Bunraku Japanese Doll Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1978 he was awarded by the BalletFederationofthePhilippines during the Third National Ballet Festival for his wartime work in the Philippines and his impresario work thereafter. In 2010, for his support for the School of American Ballet, he was given a tribute by the New York City Ballet, and for his invaluable contribution to the world of dance, he was honored by the mayor of Gyor, Hungary. In 2012, the French Ministry of Culture decorated Szilard for his cultural contributions to French society. His autobiography, titled <strong><em>Under My Wings: My Life as an Impresario</em></strong>, was released in 2002.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Basilio Esteban S.

It is the first dance group in Tawi-Tawi which was organized at the height of martial law in the 1970s when armed conflict also led to the youth&rsquo;s loss of interest in tradition. Thus, the formation of the group was a positive development, with its aim to revive, stimulate, and sustain interest in Tausug, Sama, Sama Dilaut (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a>), and Jama Mapun dance, music, and ritual. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2397\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2398\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a> Fernando Amilbangsa</strong></a></strong></a> was the troupe&rsquo;s founder and director who initiated the granting of academic scholarships to TCT members. Subsequent TCT directors were Mahail Hajan and Sakinur-ain Mugong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The troupe&rsquo;s repertoire was based on Fernando Amilbangsa&rsquo;s field research on dance forms such as the <strong>pangalay</strong> / <strong>igal</strong>, <strong>lunsay</strong>, and <strong>langka</strong>. Having little more than native talent and enthusiasm to start with, the troupe resorted to borrowing costumes and musical instruments for its early performances. In 1975, its first repertoire was well-received when the TCT toured various universities and government institutions in Manila. The success of the first performance tour enabled the group to get support for a bigger repertoire. In 1976, the TCT mounted its first major show at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> that presented many of the little-known dances of the Sulu archipelago. After the group&rsquo;s exposure to media and mainstream dance companies, the indigenous dances became part of the repertory of professional and amateur folk dance groups in the Philippines and abroad. These include dances for wedding ceremony such as <strong>pangalay pangantin</strong> perfomed by the bride and groom. The TCT also popularized <strong>pangilok</strong> (courtship dance), <strong>pamansak</strong> or <strong>igal/pangalay ha pattong</strong> (pangalay/igal atop twin bamboo poles), <strong>tawti</strong> (fishermen catching catfish), <strong>bula&rsquo;bula</strong> (bamboo or shell clapper dance), <strong>tariray</strong> (clapper dance to<em>kulintangan</em>&rsquo;s tariray beat), <strong>igal buwani</strong> (male dance about gathering honey), <strong>langka baluang</strong> (monkey dance), <strong>langka silat</strong> (male martial dance), <strong>langka budjang</strong> (female martial dance), <strong>mag-jin</strong> (ritual dance to drive away evil spirits), <strong>linggisan</strong> (bird dance), and <strong>lunsay</strong> (song-dance).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The troupe&rsquo;s repertory based on Fernando Amilbangsa&rsquo;s choreography and research was later published in a book titled <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/50/15\"><strong>Pangalay: Traditional Dances and Related Folk Artistic Expressions</strong></a></em></strong>, 1983. In the 2000s, Fernando Amilbangsa, who went back to Manila in 1987, remains a unifying and influential figure in Tambuli, especially with the decline of interest in cultural heritage brought about by modernization and other external sociocultural influences. Meanwhile, many of the founding members of the troupe continue their mission as dancers, choreographers, teachers, and advocates of the culture and art of the Sulu archipelago. They are Filemon Romero, Ernesto Baird, Sakinur-ain Mugong, Mahail Hajan, Johnny Lee, Abraham Sakili, Nurnahina Aquino Alfad, and Faujia Ikkao. Since the 1970s, TCT has produced numerous dancers and choreographers who continue to propagate the traditional dances through the programs of schools, communities, and government agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TCT has travelled extensively on goodwill missions and performances; it is considered an institution in Tawi-Tawi, playing a significant role in generating and renewing interest in the Sulu archipelago&rsquo;s traditional dances.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ligaya Fernando Amilbangsa, updated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\"><strong>Rosalie Matilac</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

SDT is known for showcasing various dance genres such as folk, ballroom, hip-hop, contemporary, and cheerdance. Two groups of dancers constitute the troupe: the folk dance group and cheerdance group. It is supported by Fr Ermito G. De Sagon OP, director of the UST Institute of Physical Education and Athletics (IPEA) and Edna B. Sanchez, adviser of the troupe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The troupe was established in 1968 by Emerita E. Basilio, then directress of the women&rsquo;s section of UST&rsquo;s Physical Education Department and expert in Philippine folk dance. Delly Nabong, Carmen Cruz, Arce Garcia, and student volunteers joined Basilio in establishing the University&rsquo;s cultural group. It was named &ldquo;Salinggawi,&rdquo; a contraction of the Filipino phrase &ldquo;salin ng mga dating gawi at lahi,&rdquo; or &ldquo;transfer of customs and traditions.&rdquo; SDT seeks to hone performers who excel in promoting the nation&rsquo;s cultural heritage through dance, and to develop dynamic, well-rounded, and empowered students by integrating the core values of discipline, respect, honesty, and integrity in their dancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The range of dances that SDT performs underscores the rich store of dances in the Philippines. After Basilio, Rene Hofile&ntilde;a directed the group and expanded its repertoire to include jazz dance. Later, under choreographer Ramon Pagaduan IV, SDT updated its training routine with guest choreographers like Robert Stephen R. Biadoma of the Philippine Normal University and Franco M. Velas, a former SDT member and current treasurer of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2557\"><strong>Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\"><strong>Folk Dance</strong></a> Society</strong></a>. On the other hand, mastery of modern dance techniques is of prime importance to the group&rsquo;s cheer dance performances. STD has also conducted workshops and launched into research projects to explore and enrich the field of Philippine dance and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>STD&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rural Suite&rdquo; highlights the revelry in Philippine fiestas. It includes the traditional Philippine dances <strong>bakya</strong>, <strong>maglalatik</strong>, <strong>tinikling</strong>, <strong>sakuting</strong>, and <strong>sayaw sa bangko</strong>. The group also performs ethnic dances like <strong>malong</strong>, <strong>pig-apir</strong> (fan dance), <strong>pamansak</strong>, <strong>asik</strong>, and <strong>singkil</strong>. The latter were seen in SDT&rsquo;s 2015 concert, <strong><em>Enchant II</em></strong>, with its <strong><em>Muslim Suite</em></strong>, one of its most famous repertoires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another dance mode and working with the Yellow Jackets, UST&rsquo;s official pep squad and drumline, the SDT regularly performs at basketball games played by the University&rsquo;s Growling Tigers Men&rsquo;s Basketball Team, as in the annual University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SDT has also participated in dance festivals in Pangasinan and Zambales, and in international dance festivals and competitions in Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei. It was featured on television shows such as <strong><em>SOP</em></strong>, <strong><em>Myx Mo!</em></strong> (Your Mix), <strong><em>Wish Ko Lang</em></strong> (My Wish), <strong><em>Unang Hirit</em></strong> (First Strike), GMA 7&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/474\"><strong>Siete Palabras</strong></a></em></strong> (Seven Last Words), and <strong><em>Umagang Kay Ganda</em></strong> (What A Beautiful Morning).It has staged full concerts all about Philippine culture and society, such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3898\"><strong>Banyuhay</strong></a></em></strong> (New Life), 2005; <strong><em>Deja vu</em></strong>,2006; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1838\"><strong>Almost Home</strong></a></em></strong>, 2007; <strong><em>Salin ng Dating mga Gawi at Lahi</em></strong>, 2008; <strong><em>Musuo</em></strong>, 2009; <strong><em>Footnotes</em></strong>,2010; <strong><em>Eterno</em></strong>,2011; <strong><em>Memorabilia</em></strong>, 2012; <strong><em>Eros</em></strong>,2013; <strong><em>Enchant</em></strong>, 2014; and <strong><em>Enchant II</em></strong>,2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SDT won the following awards: Champion in the UAAP <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/48\"><strong>Cheerdance</strong></a> Competition, 1994-96 and 2002-06; 1st runner-up in the UAAP Cheerdance Competition, 1999, 2000, 2007, and 2008; champion in the 2012 Philippine National Games (Cheerdance Category and All Girls Group Stunts); and 1st runner-up in the 2013 Philippine National Games (Cheerdance Category, Co-Ed Group Stunts, and Team Tumbling Category).<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Kristine May D.

Shea was assistant director of physical education (PE) at the UE, where she organized a ten-member group of PE majors to perform folk dance numbers on and off-campus. The troupe received official recognition from Socorro Espiritu, dean of UE&rsquo;s College of Liberal Arts, and financial support and scholarships from Francisco Dalupan, university president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Eloisa de Leon, with the assistance of Aurora Tonibio, took over as director from Shea, she added a repertoire of modern dances choreographed by Manolo Rosado, a principal dancer of Kaethe Hauser and Dubsky-Zipper. In 1964, CorazonGeneroso-I&ntilde;igo became dance director and focused on dances for the University Athletics Association of the Philippines or UAAP basketball seasons. The troupe also had a heavy schedule of performances in university functions, Metro Manila, and the provinces. In 1970 it was invited to the Osaka World&rsquo;s Fair for Philippine Day. Under the administration of Romeo Protasio, who took over in 1972, moderndance classes were started under Betsy Escandor. In 1974, GenerCaringal, principal dancer and choreographer of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\"><strong>Ballet</strong></a>Philippines (BP), became director and strengthened the modern dance repertoire. He also contributed some of his choreographic pieces. The group&rsquo;s performances abroad included those in Europe in 1984 and 1987, and in the United States in 1988. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of its directors was Constantino &ldquo;Jojo&rdquo; Lucila, a former BP member and artistic director of the Chameleon Dance Company, and Contemporario Ethnico Filipino with NonoyFroilan. Lucila continued the training in modern dance and added his own works to the repertoire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the noted dancers trained by the UEDanceCompany are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2473\"><strong>Nonoy Froilan</strong></a>, ManuelMolina, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2422\"><strong>Gener Caringal</strong></a>, Jinn Ibarrola, and LitoCalzado.

The company&rsquo;s mission is to promote dance as a serious form of study and profession and as public and communal expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UPDC is the only company known to have deconstructed dance classics, like <strong><em>Cinderella</em></strong> into <strong><em>Mariang Sinderela, ang Bagong <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a></em></strong> (Maria Cinderella, the New Heroine)by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2491\"><strong>Joelle Jacinto</strong></a> and Angela Lawenko Baguilat, 1996; <strong><em>Nutcracker</em></strong> into <strong><em>Cracked Nut</em></strong>, <strong><em>Maria Clara&rsquo;s Colonial Dream</em></strong> by Veronique Duma Berdin, Desiree Peralejo Medina, and Jesusa Noveno Noel, 1997; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/146\"><strong>Giselle</strong></a></em></strong> into <strong><em>Ang Higanti</em></strong> (The Revenge) by Ava Maureen Ong and Joyce Comia Banal, 2003; <strong><em>Swan Lake</em></strong> into <strong><em>Sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a>, Sa Puti</em></strong> (The Black Swan and the White Swan) by Yasnina Jumalon and Gianella Reyes, 2009; and the most notable of all, <strong><em>Petroushka</em></strong> into <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/179\"><strong>Pedro Kusinero</strong></a></em></strong> (Peter the Cook) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2395\"><strong>Herbert Alvarez</strong></a> and Ma. Elena Laniog, 2004. <strong><em>Pedro Kusinero</em></strong>,perhaps one of UPDC&rsquo;s landmark pieces, was featured in the <strong><em>WiFi Body Festival</em></strong> in 2009 with a live performance of Igor Stravinsky&#39;s musicby the UP Orchestra under the baton of Professor Edna Marcil Martinez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notable choreographies of UPDC are works of Flordeliza Fernandez such as her translation of Stravinsky&rsquo;s <strong><em>Les Noces</em></strong> into <strong><em>Ang Kasal</em></strong> (The Wedding), 2004, <strong><em>Femina</em></strong> (Feminine), 1995, and <strong><em>Souvenirs</em></strong>, 2004; and works of Ma.

In 2007, Villaruz appointed Angela Lawenko Baguilat and Herbert Alvarez as co-artistic directors. Together with resident choreographer and ballet mistress Ma. Elena Laniog, Baguilat and Alvarez, as organizers of the annual Contemporary Dance Map in Quezon City and the WiFi Body Independent Contemporary Dance Festival at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a>, were able to strengthen the UDPC as one of the forerunners of contemporary dance in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the UPDC have received the UP College of Music Student Council Awards, a grant from the National Commission for Culture and the Arts to teach in all UP campuses, and invitations to festivals in Taiwan, Malaysia, Macau, and Hong Kong, workshops and residencies, as well as scholarships in Asia and Europe. Over the years, some of the company&rsquo;s members and choreographers like Al Bernard, Elena Laniog, Herbert Alvarez, and Japhet Cabling have become prominent figures in the Philippine dance scene.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2509\"><strong>Angela Lawenko-Baguilat</strong></a></strong> </em></p>\r\n"

Eventually the Filipiniana Dance Group was formally organized under Cynthia Villa (now Abad Santos). Subsequently, the group was directed by Lourdes Saniel, Lydia Buendia, Nelly Zafra, Teresa Miraflor-Agsalud, Linda Kimpo, CorazonGeneroso-I&ntilde;igo, Leilani Gonzalo, Von Manalo, and Peter Alcedo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UP artist-in-residence Generoso-I&ntilde;igo was responsible for its artistic growth for 18 years. Some of the group&rsquo;s popular pieces include the <strong>uyaoy</strong> from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\"><strong>Ifugao</strong></a>, the <strong>dugso</strong> and <strong>pagapir</strong> from Mindanao, <strong>tinikling</strong>, and festival dances such as the <strong>Ati-Atihan</strong>. From an all-Filipino folk repertory, the group began to include moderndance, light ballet, and jazz. Their pieces include AliceReyes&rsquo;s <strong><em>BungkosSuite</em></strong>,EdnaVida&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/965\"><strong>Pagsamba</strong></a></em></strong> (Worship), DenisaReyes&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Last Flower</em></strong>, GenerCaringal&rsquo;s <strong><em>AngSultan</em></strong> (The Sultan) and <strong><em>Simple</em></strong><strong><em>Symphony</em></strong>,TonyFabella&rsquo;s <strong><em>Changes</em></strong>,DouglasNierras&rsquo;s <strong><em>Maglalatik</em></strong>,and Generoso-I&ntilde;igo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Baile de</em></strong><strong><em>Ayer</em></strong> (Dance of Yesteryears), <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a> From the Cordilleras</em></strong>, <strong><em>Fantasia</em></strong>, <strong><em>Correlations</em></strong><strong><em>and Celebrations</em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/189\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong></a></em></strong>. With Manalo, it acquired a more diversified repertory, fusing jazz and folk styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The group has represented the Philippines in festivals and concert halls in France, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Yugoslavia, Romania, the United States, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Thailand, Jordan, and Egypt. In the decade of the 2000s, the group&rsquo;s presence was strongly felt in Asia, particularly during the Midosuji Parade in Osaka, Japan in 2007, and the Surin International Folklore Festival from 2006 to 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines, the group is a regular performer during university events such as the 2009 UPCentennial concert tribute, <strong><em>Isang Daan</em></strong> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Road), which was also performed in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/950\"><strong>Misa</strong></a>mis Oriental General Comprehensive High School, Cagayan de Oro.

In the commemorative TV documentary of the opening of the United Nations city in Vienna in 1979, the UPFilipinianaDanceGroup was chosen to give the finale presentation, a choice over 54 countries representing the five continents of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the leadership of its director Peter Alcedo Jr, the performers undergo intensive training in folk dance and jazz, complemented by aerobic forms of dance.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Corazon Generoso-I&ntilde;igo, with notes from Ruth Jordana L.

The president&rsquo;s committee on folk songs and dances composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\"><strong>Francisco Santiago</strong></a>, H. Otley Beyer, Cecilio Lopez, Antonio J.

Typical of their repertory were the Kalinga wedding dance, <strong>abaruray</strong>, <strong>aetana</strong>, <strong>alcamfor</strong>, <strong>anuncio</strong>, <strong>areuana</strong>, <strong>ariguinding-guinding</strong>, <strong>bailes de ayer</strong>, <strong>bakya</strong>, <strong>ba-o</strong>, <strong>kandingan</strong>, <strong>kuratsa</strong>, <strong>dugso</strong>, <strong>esperanza</strong>, <strong>garambal</strong>, <strong>habanera</strong>, <strong>la jota</strong>, <strong>lawiswis kawayan</strong>, <strong>magasik</strong>, <strong>maglalatik</strong>, <strong>palay</strong>, <strong>pandang-pandang</strong>, <strong>pandanggo</strong>, <strong>pasakat</strong>, <strong>purpuri</strong>, <strong>rogelia</strong>, <strong>sakuting</strong>, <strong>sagayan</strong>, <strong>salakot</strong>, <strong>salampati</strong>, <strong>siring</strong>, <strong>sua-sua</strong>, <strong>subli</strong>, <strong>tadek</strong>, <strong>tiklos</strong>, <strong>ti liday</strong>,and <strong>urukay</strong>. Besides performing the songs and dances, Reyes-Tolentino lectured on Filipino dances, and Buenaventura on Filipino music. They performed in Luzon provinces and in Iloilo, Bacolod, and Cebu cities in the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1939, when Bocobo was named Secretary of Public Instruction, he asked for Mrs Tolentino to be transferred to the Bureau of Education. The club or troupe thus &ldquo;hibernated&rdquo; for the next nine years. Then, in 1948, Luz Einsiedel informally organized physical education majors of UP to continue the work of Reyes-Tolentino and to fulfill requests for folk dance performances. This group became the nucleus of the UPFilipinianaDanceGroup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The club or troupe attracted an impressive list of charter members, many of them socially prominent.

Angono, Rizal 19 Jan 1932. d. Angono, Rizal 17 Mar 2017. Dancer and teacher of <strong>bati</strong>, the devotional dance style unique to Angono. She is the daughter of fisherman Clemente Vitor, and homemaker, Potenciana Vocalan. An elder brother, Primitivo aka Tibong, is a band musician and also a bati dance teacher. Her nieces, Estelita Perez-Gil and Valentina Perez-Villamayor, were chosen as bati dancers and from then on assisted Vitor in teaching the dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitor dedicated her life to the faithful transmission of the devotional dance since 1955 when she was randomly chosen to become the<em>kapitana</em>(female captain). She emerged as a natural bati dancer owing to years of observation since childhood when she watched the dancers train during rehearsals inside the church convent and during Holy Week rituals where bati is traditionally performed. Her mentor was Emilia San Pedro, a former kapitana and a choir conductor, who is also the sister of Lucio San Pedro, later proclaimed National Artist. From 1955 up to the 2010s, Vitor took on the task of teaching the bati variants of the kapitana and the<em>tenyenta</em>(female lieutenant)&mdash;the two main performers of the bati. Through her long teaching experience that spans six decades, she developed her simple but unrecorded instructional method. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/41\"><strong>Bati</strong></a> dancers are randomly chosen from a council of women devotees who are amateur dancers. Her teaching technique trains even the non-dancer to gracefully perform the back-breaking postures of the bati along with the continuous waving of the flag. She teaches how the specific dances of the kapitana and the tenyenta are performed to the accompaniment of their respective band music. Her simple system also teaches the kapitana how to recite the 20-minute<em>dicho</em>(long poem) which is rendered with precise stances, body movements, and gestures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitor received recognition for her commitment to preserve the local dance form. In 2001, the province of Rizal awarded her the Gawad Pagkilala at Pagpapahalaga for her effort to carry on the enduring traditions of Angono. In 2007, she was named Outstanding Senior Citizen of Rizal for her exemplary role in keeping alive the local art and culture. She was given the Gawad Likas na Galing at Yaman ng Angono in 2011 by the Regional Pilot School for the Arts and the Likas na Galing at Yaman ng Angono, Inc. A municipal resolution in 2012 by the local government of Angono bestowed on her the Dangal ng Bayan Award.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Rosalie S.

It was founded in Asia by Carl Wolz at the Hong Kong (HK) Academy for the Performing Arts. As legally formalized, WDA had Wolz as president and Nestor O. Jardin as vice-president. Its first member-countries were mainly from Asia which later formed WDA&rsquo;s Asia Pacific (WDA-AP) global center. The other centers are made up of the Americas (North and South) and Europe. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1070\"><strong>Period</strong></a>ically, some African countries join WDA events. WDA aims to gather dance artists, scholars, educators, producers, and promoters around the world. This was initially coursed through conferences and festivals in HK, which are now held annually in member countries or in global centers (Asia Pacific for the Philippines). Biennially, there is an overall global event which was held several times in Asia or Australia, the Americas, and Europe. The Philippines was a host to events in 1991 and 1998 at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2649\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"><strong>Cultural Center of the Philippines</strong></a></strong></a> (CCP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WDA-Philippines&rsquo;s (WDA-P) first president was Jardin. In 1980, he called for an election constituted by a national board. Elected were Basilio Esteban S. Villaruz as president, Corazon G. I&ntilde;igo as vice-president, Prosperidad Arandez as secretary, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2485\"><strong>Shirley Halili-Cruz</strong></a> as treasurer, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2474\"><strong>Larry Gabao</strong></a> as public relations officer. With the death of Arandez, Halili-Cruz became secretary-treasurer. As a member country, the Philippines pays annual dues to WDA-Asia Pacific and joins conferences and festivals of WDA-AP, and global ones in Asia, the Americas, and Europe. In 2000 in Tokyo, Villaruz succeeded Miki Wakamatsu as president of WDA-AP. After him came Mohd <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>s Md Nor of Malaysia, and the current president, Yunyu Wang Cheng of Taiwan.
