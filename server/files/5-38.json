Within the confines of the home, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a> mother sings a <b>tami</b> to lull her child to sleep just as the Ata mother sings an <b>a-di-ya-di</b> for the same purpose. For relaxation, Tagakaolo maidens play the <b>sluray</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/832\">bamboo zither</a>) while seated on the floor of the house, while the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>&nbsp;youth plays his <b>kalleleng </b>(nose flute) to serenade a loved one at her doorstep or merely to pass the time away in his abode.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On more solemn occasions, the home is the venue for a curing ritual such as the <i>gasumbi</i> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> where the <i>mandadawak</i> (priest or priestess) dances and chants around the sick person to drive away the evil spirit. Preparations for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a>, which include the butchering of a pig and the making of a <b>tongatong</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/828\">bamboo stamping tubes</a>), take place in the yard beside the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An elaborate ceremony among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> called <i>pegayep</i> is performed in the home of the <i>balyan</i> (shaman) to invoke the good spirits. Numerous paraphernalia consisting of a <i>binalay</i> (altar), a <i>bahangsu</i> (a seven-step ladder) containing food offerings, a miniature boat which the seven <i>diwata</i> (spirit deities) are supposed to ride to and from the ritual, a large <i>gadyong</i> (swing) hanging from the rafters on which the balyan dances, a low platform for the musicians who play on the <b>gagung pon</b> and <b>gandingan</b> (bossed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a>), and <b>strike porcelain bowls </b>are prepared. The balyan alternately chants and dances, and shakes dried rattan leaves on whose handle a pair of <b>dumala</b> (bells) is attached. The small hall is dimly lit by kerosene lamps which are extinguished when the balyan goes into a trance. The audience then, consisting of the village folk, sits on the floor, against the walls of the hut, and requests for cure or medicine from the spirits through the balyan. Questions are also answered. During the three-hour ceremony, incense is burned intermittently from a bowl containing <i>dagtu</i> (extracts from a tree), <i>daga</i> (chicken blood), <i>pulinan</i> (charcoal), <i>balasi</i> (shells), <i>sulu</i> (an orange-colored stone), and <i>dlemuga</i> (tree bark).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rituals performed among other groups of people take place in open fields, beside a holy tree, or even by the riverbank. In the fields, music accompanies planting and harvesting activities. The Bontok&nbsp;sing the <b>ayoweng</b> while working in the field, and the Kalinga sing the <b>sungiyaw</b> to help reapers forget the heat of the sun. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> of Basilan prepare the holes for seeds with a <i>tabbak</i> (pointed bamboo stick) whose other end is connected to a <i>daluppal</i> (split bamboo pole). When the pole strikes the ground, it creates varying rhythmic and melodic structures. Once the seeds are planted, the<b> kwintangan kayu</b>,<b> </b>which is<b> </b>made up of graduated wooden beams, is hung from a tree facing the field. It is played continuously as a means of giving life and strength to the palay seeds. Only after the seedlings have sprouted is the kwintangan kayu silenced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a>, the village meeting house is used as the venue for the <i>tambilaw</i>, a harvest thanksgiving. Great quantities of food are cooked. The community and relatives from neighboring villages gather together for the sharing of food, merrymaking, and wine drinking, accompanied by the music of <b>basal</b><i> </i>(gongs).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music is also part of ceremonies performed for the dead. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> play the <b>bangibang (</b>percussion yoke bar) during a <i>himong</i> ritual, a rite for deaths due to foul play. Many men participate as they dance in a long line, striking the bangibang and producing a rhythmic continuum of alternating light and heavy sounds. This is done in an open space. During wakes, the Alangan sing the <b>ambuwaday</b>.<b> </b>The Bontok extol the dead person with a <b>fulayao</b>, which relates the life and good deeds of the departed. The <b>didiyaw </b>is a special song sung for a dead child. It is both an expression grief and a prayer for a good life after death. The Kalinga sing the <b>dassar</b> before the burial of a murdered person asking for vengeance. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, the family of the departed requests for the wake song called <b>diaga</b>.<b> </b>On a death anniversary, the Subanon sing the <b>bahay-bahay</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">Epic</a> singing takes place during festivals or funerals or at events where more than the usual number of people are around. Some accounts speak of epic singing during voyages at sea where the cadence of the singing coincides with the motions of the rowing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>Hispanic Tradition</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the coming of the Spaniards, new venues for music making were added, notably the church, the church courtyard, the town plaza, the streets, and the big halls or the <em>sala </em>of the large homes of <i>ilustrados </i>(educated). Later on, music performances took place in public theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The church was the scene of liturgical music sung and played during the mass and other church services. The friars took pains in teaching <b>canto llano</b> (Gregorian chant) and <b>canto d&rsquo;organo</b> (polyphony). They also taught the playing of instruments&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/820\">organ</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>. Historical chronicles speak of organ playing during the mass and the proficiency of church singing comparable to that in Spain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Eventually, nonliturgical songs were performed on the various feasts of the church calendar. Many of these are still done today. In May, songs are sung during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><i>flores de Mayo</i></a> as young girls offer flowers to the Virgin Mary in church. In southern Luzon, the &ldquo;Alay kay Maria&rdquo; (Hymn to Mary) begins with a procession of young men and women around town which ends in the church. Inside the church, hymns are sung in between prayers by the youths who offer flowers to the image of the Virgin Mary. Also in May are the processions along the town streets like the <i>santacruzan</i>, which celebrates the finding of the Holy Cross by Queen Helena, and the <i>kristiyanong turog</i>, <i>pamukaw</i>, and <i>aurora</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Christmas season, carolers walk through the streets and stop to serenade households with Spanish <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/799\">villancicos</a> </b>and vernacular songs. These carols are called <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\">pastores</a> </b>in Bicol, <b>daigon</b> in the Visayas, or <b>galikon </b>in Pangasinan. The reenactment through song of the search for a lodging by Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><b>panunuluyan</b></a>, <b>pananapatan</b>, <b>pananawagan</b>, <b>kagharong</b>, or <b>solomon</b> takes place in the streets on Christmas eve. The singers playing the Virgin and Saint Joseph stop at designated houses, seeking shelter, but are rejected a few times. Eventually, the holy couple ends their search at the church, where the nativity scene is revealed on or near the altar at the &ldquo;Gloria.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Lenten season calls for the singing of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a>,<b> </b>the versified story of Jesus Christ and his death on the cross. Done as part of a <i>panata</i> (vow), the pasyon may be sung on Ash Wednesday, on the Sundays of Lent, and on Holy Week, in homes, makeshift sheds built along streets, or barrio chapels. During Holy Week, processions feature the <i>carro</i> (floats) bearing images of saints and scenes from Christ&rsquo;s passion, followed by brass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">bands</a> playing slow <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><b>marchas</b></a> (marches). During Lent and especially on Holy Week, the passion play called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><i>sinakulo</i></a> or <i>tanggal</i> is staged in town plazas or church patios in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> regions. In the play, actors&rsquo; lines are <i>cantada</i> (sung) or <i>ablado</i> (spoken), and characters march to lively <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><b>paso doble</b></a> or <b>punebre</b> played by the band. Easter is celebrated with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><i>salubong</i></a>, the reenactment of the meeting of Christ and his mother on the first Easter Sunday, which is performed in the church courtyard, with a young child dressed as an angel lifting the veil of the grieving Mary, and singing &ldquo;Regina Coeli, Laetare&rdquo; to the accompaniment of the brass band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In November, the eve of All Saints&rsquo; Day and All Souls&rsquo; Day is the occasion for singing the <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/463\">pangangaluluwa</a> </b>songs from house to house. The revelers pretend to be souls of old unmarried men and women in purgatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Feasts of patron saints are preceded by nine-day church novenas that feature songs called <b>gozos</b>.<b> </b>Processions feature the town band as well as those from neighboring towns. Celebrations are a mixture of the religious and the profane. Besides the masses and processions, there are dining and dancing with the <i>hermanas mayores</i> (sponsors) splurging on the affair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To celebrate town fiestas or family affairs or the visits of important dignitaries, the sala or living room of ilustrados become the scene for elegant balls where music and dancing last until the wee hours of the morning. Writers speak of the presence of pianos or harps in homes. Young ladies were taught to play these instruments, and it was customary for homeowners to ask their daughter to perform for visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Travelogues written in the 19th century attest to the excellence of the military bands that played regularly at gathering places all over the islands. In smaller towns, performances took place in the town plaza. In Manila, the most famous venues for an evening of band music were the Plaza Mayor, the <i>calzada </i>(street), and later, Luneta&mdash;all in or around <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>. Performances at the Luneta took place nightly from six to eight. This major form of entertainment continues until today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the town plazas of the past, music was also heard in the <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a> </i>performances during fiestas. Travel writers made much mention of the calzada near the Manila Bay, that part of Luneta where military bands performed two evenings in a week. Formerly known as Bagumbayan, Luneta is known today as Rizal Park where the national hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\">Jose Rizal</a> was executed. The Rizal Park Amphitheater has been the setting for the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1426\"><strong>Concert at the Park</strong></a></i></b> held every Sunday since 1978. This program received the Hall of Fame Award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4781\">Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA)</a> in 1990 as the longest running performing arts series. Concert at the Park, managed by the National Parks Development Committee, also produces <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1482\"><strong>Paco Park Presents</strong></a></i></b> held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/350\">Paco Cemetery</a> in Manila, a weekly Friday evening concert program which started in Feb 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Within the walled city of Intramuros, the Puerta Real Gardens was the venue for the Puerta Real Evenings which presented on and off-season productions of local and foreign performing arts groups, dance, music, and theater productions from 1979 until the 1990s. It garnered the CMMA for Best Cultural Program in 1983. This project was under the Intramuros Administration which to date also presents concerts at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>, including a cultural show held on Saturday and Sunday afternoons. The Maestranza Plaza was the setting of the Euro-Pinoy Jazz Concert held in Feb 2014. Other open-air venues include the Dulaang Raha Sulayman in Fort Santiago, Paco Park, and the Hinulugang Taktak Park in Antipolo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In modern times, churches in different parts of the country have become alternate venues for performances and special celebrations. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a> in Intramuros, the country&rsquo;s oldest church and a UNESCO World Heritage site, mounted the San Agustin Music Festival from 1999 to 2009. The St. Joseph Parish Church in Las Pi&ntilde;as City has hosted the International Bamboo Organ Festival every February since 1976. This followed the inaugural concert on 5 May 1975 celebrating the return of the bamboo organ to the Las Pi&ntilde;as Church from the Johannes Klais Orgelbau factory in Bonn, Germany, where it went through two years of restoration work. The festival is organized by the Bamboo Organ Foundation Inc., through the combined efforts of parishioners, sponsors, and patrons, including the Diplomatic Corps. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4036\">Las Pi&ntilde;as Boys Choir</a>, the organist Armando Salarza, and many local and international musical artists and groups have performed for the festival. Outside Manila, other churches have hosted musical events. In 2016, Kabataang Gitarista performed in front of the main altar of the church of Pila, Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><i>Tertulias</i> (soirees) used to take place in the homes of the gentry, the ilustrados, and Spanish government officials in the 1800s. Today, music performances are also often held in private homes to celebrate important milestones, as well as in residences of the Diplomatic Corps who introduce international visiting artists. In the late 19th century, Malaca&ntilde;an Palace and the Casino Espa&ntilde;ol were also venues for occasional chamber music concerts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rise of the bourgeoisie in the middle of the 19th century gave rise to the cultural practice of attending musical events in public. The music concert, which initially was done hand in hand with, but which later supplanted, the literary-musical event called <b>veladas</b>, began to have regular performances only in the last quarter of 19th century and in the early 20th century. From the mid-19th century, the public primarily patronized musical theater, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a> and later on the <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a></strong> and stage plays with incidental music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As Western influence became more pronounced, the outdoor makeshift performance venues gradually gave way to a more formal setting. Public theaters were built, with the audience paying entrance fees. Performers now appeared onstage with the audience as spectators. The komedya, sarsuwela,<b> </b>opera, and concerts were presented in these theaters. Writing in 1909, Wenceslao Retana cited the existence of 13 theaters in Manila: Teatro Comico, established in 1790; Teatro Arroceros and Teatro de Tondo, both established in the early 1800s; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3293\">Teatro de Binondo</a>, also known as the Teatro Castellano, the first formal Spanish theater in Manila, which opened in 1846; and Teatro Lirico de Tondo, Teatro del Principe Alfonso, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3292\">Teatro Circo de Bilibid</a>, Teatro de Variedades, Coliseo Artistico, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3296\">Teatro Filipino</a>, Teatro Lirico de Quiapo, Teatro Calderon, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a>, all built after 1850. Other theaters built were Pandacan&rsquo;s Opera Theater, Teatro Infantil de Dalumbayan, Teatro Infantil Tagala, Teatro Infantil Malate&ntilde;a, Teatro Tagalo de Aranque, Teatro Tagalo de Tanduay, Teatro Tagalo de Infantil de Barrio Aguila, and Teatro Infantil de Oroquieta. These theaters had the patronage of the bourgeoisie and ordinary citizens of Manila. During the American colonial period, theaters in the Visayas included the Teatro Oriente in Cebu, Teatro La Carlota in Iloilo, Teatro Talisay north of Bacolod, Teatro Kahirup in Silay, Negros Occidental, and the Bohol Opera House. In Pampanga, Teatro Sabina showcased the drama and sarsuwela of prominent Kapampangan playwrights like Crissot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While these theaters were built primarily for stage plays, some were used for musical presentations, particularly the Spanish zarzuela. In 1862, a visiting French operetta company performed in Teatro del Principe Alfonso, which likewise showcased a symphonic concert in 1871 under the baton of Ignacio Morales. Circo Teatro de Bilibid featured the Assi-Panades Italian Opera Company in 1874. Concerts by visiting artists Remenyi, 1886, and Freidenthal, 1892, as well as local artists Jose Silos, 1900, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3979\">Jose Estella</a>, 1901, were held at Teatro Filipino on Echague Street. <b><i><strong>Lucia</strong> di</i> <i>Lammermoor</i></b><i> </i>was staged at Teatro Lirico de Quiapo by the M. Maugard French Opera Company. However, it was at Teatro Zorrilla, established in 1893, where many memorable concerts and sarsuwela were held, including the first Filipino opera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/997\"><b><i>Sangdugong Panaguinip</i></b></a><i> </i>(<b><i>Dreamed Alliance</i></b>), 1902, by composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3910\">Ladislao Bonus</a> and librettist Pedro Paterno.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>American and Contemporary Traditions</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The biggest show house constructed after the Philippine revolution was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a>, described as the &ldquo;National Theater&rdquo; in 1902. It was the site of many important musical events&mdash;Rizal Day programs, grand concerts of foreign and Filipino artists, sarsuwela, and operatic presentations, notably the Philippine premier of Giuseppe Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>Aida</i></b><i> </i>in 1933. Eventually, these shows gave way to the vaudeville and musicals which replaced the sarsuwela and concerts in popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, inaugurated in 1931, presented the best foreign and local artists performing in operas, zarzuela, orchestral, choral and solo concerts, musicals, dance, and theater productions. Its opening was a welcome event, as the Manila Grand Opera House, inaugurated in 1902, and the Teatro Circo de Zorrilla, inaugurated in 1893, were both deteriorating. The Metropolitan Theater was severely damaged during World War II and was restored three decades after, opening with an inaugural concert held on 17 Dec 1978. Its two halls were the main Conchita Sunico Hall and the more intimate side hall, Dalubdulaan. The theater closed down in 1996 due to a dispute between the City of Manila and the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) regarding the ownership of the building. Its last concert on 18 Jun 2011 featured the local rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4233\">Wolfgang</a> in celebration of the 440th year of the City of Manila.

In Manila, the St. Cecilia&rsquo;s Hall, inaugurated in 1932, presents recitalists of the St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College School of Music, the oldest music school in the country, existing since 1906. The Hall, destroyed during World War II, was rebuilt in the 1950s and renovated in the late 1990s. The Corazon Aquino Hall in the new building inaugurated in 2011 presents smaller recitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Fleur-de-lis Auditorium is the concert venue of the St. Paul University College of Music.

It was designed by the late National Artist for Architecture <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a> and inaugurated in 1969. CCP has three theaters: the Tanghalang Nicanor S. Abelardo, formerly known as the Main Theater; Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a>, formerly Little Theater; and Tanghalang Huseng Batute, its experimental theater, formerly Bulwagang Gantimpala. Occasionally, CCP&rsquo;s ASEAN Park and the front lawn are used for performances of brass bands, choirs, and instrumental ensembles. During its annual Pasinaya Open House Festival, a one-day multi-arts Festival initiated in 2005 and held usually in February, the Center also opens the Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5372\">Amado Hernandez</a>, its conference room; Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes Aquino</a>, its rehearsal hall; the Main Theater ramp and lobby; the <i>eskinita</i> (alley) in between the CCP and the Production Design Center; and Pedro Bukaneg Street, fronting the Little Theater entrance. In celebration of the Pasinaya Festival&rsquo;s 10th year on 15 Mar 2014, the CCP partnered with several museums in Manila in presenting performances: the Metropolitan Museum and Museo Pambata (Children&rsquo;s Museum) along Roxas Boulevard, the National Museum located next to Rizal Park, Casa Manila, and Bahay Tsinoy or Museum of Chinese in Philippine Life in Intramuros. The Center also manages the Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Balagtas</a> or Folk Arts Theater, and the Manila Film Center, both located at the CCP Complex. Tanghalang Francisco Balagtas, which seats 8,000, used to present large popular concerts.

This was participated in by 850 high school students from the University of the Philippines Integrated School (UPIS). Earlier, in 1971, the main lobby and stairway of the Main Theater was used for the performance of Maceda&rsquo;s<i> <b>Cassettes <strong>100</strong></b></i>,<i> </i>participated in by 100 cassette-bearing ambulant participants sounding pretaped music and freely mingling with the audience. In 1991, the loading dock at the side of the main theater stage was the venue of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\">Ramon P.

These may come in the form of trophies, medals, or cash rewards as prizes in competition. Grants are given to artists to help in the creation and/or performance of musical works. These may be given in the form of cash or subsidy to finance a tour or the rental of a venue for the performance. Commissions are financial awards given to composers to create a musical work. A music contest is an event designed to identify, select, and award outstanding musical ensembles, soloists, and works.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both public and private sectors give commissions, grants, and awards for music, and sponsor music contests.

Other recipients of the award in the field of music in 2006 were members of the American hip-hop group Black Eyed Peas apl.de.ap and will.I.am, who brought international recognition to the country and held charity concerts to raise funds and help victims of calamities in various regions in the Philippines in the same year; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4001\">Otoniel Gonzaga</a> in 2007. In 2009, the award was posthumously conferred to rapper Francis Magalona.</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The National Artist Award, established under Presidential Proclamation No. 1001 on 27 Apr 1972 to honor Filipinos who have made outstanding contributions to Philippine arts and letters, replaced the Republic Cultural Heritage Award. It was later amended through Presidential Proclamation No. 1144 issued on 15 May 1973, creating a National Artists Award Committee to administer the conferment of the honor. It is now the highest and most prestigious award that the government gives to musicians and other artists. The following have been named National Artists for Music: Antonio J. Molina, 1973, who &ldquo;pioneered in transmuting native melodies and rhythms into musical compositions of great originality and force&rdquo;; Jovita Fuentes, 1976, for &ldquo;her mastery of the noblest musical instrument, the voice, which continues to inspire and invigorate the musical development of the country&rdquo;; Honorata &ldquo;Atang&rdquo; de la Rama, 1987, for &ldquo;her sincere devotion to original theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer and as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a><b> </b>actor-playwright-producer,&rdquo; and for &ldquo;her tireless efforts to bring her art to all regions and sectors of Filipino society and to the world&rdquo;; Antonino R.

Kasilag, 1990, &ldquo;[whose] devotion to her art &hellip; has added important new dimensions to our musical traditions, earning the respect and admiration of many&rdquo;; Lucio D. San Pedro, 1991, for &ldquo;his musical philosophy of &lsquo;creative nationalism&rsquo; [which] entails an imaginative and emotional interaction between the artist and his culture&rdquo;; Felipe Padilla de Leon, 1997, for having &ldquo;achieved a keen understanding and oneness with the soul of his people such that his music breathes its very essence&rdquo;; Levi Celerio, 1997, for being a &ldquo;poet for the man-on-the-street who easily relates to him and his works, a true artist of the people &hellip; reaching out to the ordinary Filipino&rdquo;; Jose Maceda, 1997, for having &ldquo;dedicated his life towards the promotion of a national cultural identity, initiating and inspiring the scholarly study of the music and culture of the Filipino minority groups&rdquo;; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\">Ernani Cuenco</a>, 1999, who believed that &ldquo;music unheard was as good as music not created at all&rdquo;; Andrea O. Veneracion, 1999, for having &ldquo;consistently kept the Philippine Madrigal Singers&rsquo; hallmark of excellence, and for establishing a tradition of fine choral singing in the Philippines&rdquo;; Francisco Feliciano, 2014, for having &ldquo;brought the wealth of indigenous Philippine culture to the musical stages of the world&rdquo;; Ramon P. Santos, 2014, whose body of works highlight the &ldquo;people-specific concepts central to the ethnomusicological discipline, the translation of indigenous musical systems into modern musical discourse, and the marriage of Western and non-Western sound&rdquo;; and Ryan Cayabyab, 2018,</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In support of National Artists, Presidential Decree No. 208, effected on 7 Jun 1973, granted them further privileges and honors: a 10,000-peso gift cheque; a monthly life pension of 2,000 pesos; medical and hospitalization benefits; lifetime insurance of 50,000 pesos; a place of honor at state functions, national commemoration ceremonies, and all other cultural presentations; and a state funeral. National Artists are recommended by the Board of Trustees of the CCP, and since 1989, also by the Presidential (now National) Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), and declared by the President. In 2003, EO No. 236 was signed which established the honors code of the Philippines to create an order of precedence of honors conferred and for other purposes. By virtue of this EO, the National Artist Award became the Orden ng mga Pambansang Alagad ng Sining (Order of National Artists), with revised privileges and honors. The cash award was increased to 100,000 for living awardees and 75,000 for posthumous awardees; so, too, the monthly life pension and medical and hospitalization benefits. Life insurance coverage was given to awardees who were still insurable. Also sustained were arrangements and expenses for a state funeral and burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani (Cemetery of Heroes); a place of honor, in line with protocol, at national state functions, and acknowledgment at cultural events.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">As a counterpart of the Order of National Artist, Republic Act (RA) No. 7355 was passed on 3 Apr 1992, which provided for the recognition of national living treasures, otherwise known as the Manlilikha ng Bayan (Creator of the Nation), and the promotion and development of traditional folk arts. The Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan or GAMABA (National Living Treasure Award) was created through Executive Order No. 236 and is &ldquo;conferred upon a Filipino citizen or group of Filipino citizens engaged in any traditional art uniquely Filipino, whose distinctive skills have reached such a high level of technical and artistic excellence and have been passed on to and widely practiced by the present generations in his/her community with the same degree of technical and artistic competence.&rdquo; Since its establishment, five traditional musicians have been conferred the award: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4185\">Samaon Sulaiman</a>, 1993, master of the <b>kutyapi</b> (two-stringed boat <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">lute</a>), and teacher of kulintang, <b>agong</b>, <b>gandingan</b>, <b>palendag</b>, and <b>tambul</b> (various indigenous instruments); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4019\">Masino Intaray</a>, 1993, an epic chanter from Palawan; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3858\">Uwang Ahadas</a>, 2000, a Yakan master of the <b>kwintangan</b> <b>kayu</b> and <b>tuntungan</b> (indigenous wooden instruments); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5143\">Frederico Caballero</a>, 2000, a Sulod-Bukidnon <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> chanter from Kalinog, Iloilo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4154\">Alonzo Saclag</a>, 2000, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> master of dance and performing arts.</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another award that recognizes the contribution of Filipino artists is the Ani ng Dangal, given by the NCCA annually since 2009. Unlike the other awards which focus on individual achievements through many years of artistic productivity, this covers distinctions earned by artists in all art forms on a per year basis in international competitions. Some of the Filipino musicians given the Ani ng Dangal award are Nilo Alcala, 2009; University of the East Chorale, 2009; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4207\">UP Singing Ambassadors</a>, 2009 and 2013; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4103\">Novo Concertante Manila</a>, 2009, 2010, 2013, and 2015; Cebu Chamber Singers, 2009 and 2012; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4006\">Hail Mary the Queen Children&rsquo;s Choir</a>, 2009 and 2014; Beverly Shangkuan, 2010; Ritchie Asibal, 2010; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4287\">Teresa Barrozo</a>, 2010; University of the Visayas Chorale, 2010; University of Santo Tomas Singers, 2010 and 2011; AUP Singing Ambassadors, 2012; Imusicapella, 2012 and 2013; Tristan Ignacio, 2012; Edgardo Manguiat, 2013; Joseleo Logdat, 2013; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4191\">Arwin Tan</a>, 2013; De La Salle University Chorale, 2014; Aleron, 2015; Saint Louis University Glee Club, 2015; and Alvin Paulin, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Awards have also been given solely in the field of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">popular music</a>. In 1977, the Popular Music Foundation was organized to promote contemporary compositions and develop Filipino amateur and professional composers and songwriters. In 1982, the Foundation initiated the first music industry awards known as the Cecil Awards. Named after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4045\">Cecil Lloyd</a>, the &ldquo;Filipino Mystery Singer,&rdquo; it was launched the same year to honor the country&rsquo;s best recording artists, encourage musicians, and raise artistic standards in the music industry. Some of the artists who received the Cecil Award were singers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4238\">Nonoy Zu&ntilde;iga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4040\">Kuh Ledesma</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3857\">Freddie Aguilar</a>, and composers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\">Willy Cruz</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\">George Canseco</a>. Some quarters, however, criticized the awards for favoring the big Manila-based recording companies. In 1986, the Cecil Awards bowed out from the Philippine music scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">The Awit Awards started in 1969 but ended in 1971. It came out of hiatus when the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI) revived it in 1988, aided by the Samahan sa Musika (SAMAKA). Since then, PARI has been responsible for the said award. It carries the same objectives as the Cecil Awards. The wide and varying range of categories include awards given to solo or group performers, composers, arrangers, record producers, audio engineers, music pioneers, and even a significant record or album. Among the many awardees are Gary Valenciano, Rachel Alejandro, Jose Mari Chan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3868\">APO Hiking Society</a>, Smokey Mountain, Ryan Cayabyab, Nonoy Zu&ntilde;iga, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3859\">Joey Albert</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\">Pilita Corrales</a>, The CompanY, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\">Side A</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4168\"> Band</a>, Freestyle, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4180\">South Border</a>, Gary Valenciano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4101\">Martin Nieverra</a>, Rannie Raymundo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3860\">Ogie Alcasid</a>, Rico Blanco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3922\">Noel Cabangon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4959\">Aiza Seguerra</a>, Dessa, Grace Nono, Jaya, Karylle, Kyla, Sitti, and L.A.

Since its restoration in 1978 until its untimely closure in 1990, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3098\">Metropolitan Theater</a> has actively commissioned both classical and popular composers to write sarsuwela, musicals, and other works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Private musical organizations such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a>, institutions such as schools, banks, and corporations, and private individuals have engaged many a composer to create symphonic works, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\">marches</a>, hymns, songs, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/774\">choral works</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a>, and even commercial jingles. NCCA, through its Grants Program, has funded many projects which highlight the contributions of culture to national growth and development. It aids in identifying programs and projects that focus on the positive impacts of culture and arts to the life of men and women, most especially the vulnerable and marginalized sectors in the various regions of the country. Since its inception, NCCA has provided venues for the different regions to articulate their local culture and development concerns. Among its recipients are the Pasinaya Performing Arts Market at the CCP; the <b><i>International Las Pi&ntilde;as Bamboo Organ Festiva</i></b>l; the <b><i>Pasasalamat Festival</i></b> of Pagadian; <b><i>Konsiyerto ng Pangalay</i></b>, Tula, <b><i>Salinawit at Musika</i></b>; Teduray Dance and Gong Playing; School of Living Traditions on Maguindanao Kulintang-Playing of Barangay Lower Campo Islam, Labangan, Zamboanga del Sur; <b><i>Taal Tunugan: Philippine Musical and Vocal Forms in Vernacular</i></b>; and <b><i>Kuwerdas ng Pagkakaisa</i></b> (Strings of Unity)<b> <i>Rondalla Festival</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music Contests. </b>The European classical art music idiom, traditionally, has relied heavily on the institution of music competitions to provide a forum for recognizing the most outstanding instrumentalists, vocalists, composers, orchestras, and small ensembles, thereby contributing significantly to the establishment of these artists&rsquo; careers. Classical instrumental ensembles such as brass bands, school bands and choirs, and church and community choirs have also long relied on competitions and festivals to promote their groups and showcase high levels of artistry. In recent decades, various competitions have also arisen in the field of popular music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish colonial period, formal music contests in the field of art music were first sponsored by private artistic and musical societies and by religious groups. These groups celebrated the feast of Saint Cecilia, Patroness of Music, with concerts and contests. The Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario held one such contest in 1879, where noted cellist-pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3559\">Antonio Garcia</a> won second prize. During the American period, new schools and societies continued the institution of music competitions. With the establishment of the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1908 came the competition for composing its hymn which Nicanor S. Abelardo, then a student at the UP Conservatory of Music, won in 1917. Escuelas Confederadas de Musica was a private school in Quiapo composed of three departments: the Schola Cantorum under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3931\">Victorino Carrion</a>, the Escuela de Piano under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4075\">Vicente Marifosqui</a>, and the Escuela de Violin under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\">Bonifacio Abdon</a>. These departments held their respective contests, with the Schola Cantorum even sponsoring in 1933 an essay-writing contest on music open to its graduates and students. Private individuals also sponsored music contests. The distinguished composer of sacred music, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\">Marcelo Adonay</a>, sponsored a competition for the best wedding march on the occasion of his golden wedding anniversary in 1924. Abelardo won the 100,000-peso grand prize, and his work was played during the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Japanese interregnum, 1941-45, saw a proliferation of music contests custom-made by the Japanese government to promote their own agenda. There was much music-making but the aim was to move away from the supposedly excessive, materialistic, and degenerating influence of American culture. Music contests were thus held with the goal of re-orienting or re-aligning Filipino culture towards becoming a worthy member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Some of these contests were the Pilipino Farmers Song Contest, the March and Kundiman Contest, the Philippine Band Contest, and the Music Concourse, Literary and Song-Writing Competition of the <b><i>Manila Shimbunsha</i></b>, the umbrella newspaper company during this period. Among the prize-winning compositions were &ldquo;Awit sa Paglikha ng Bagong Pilipinas&rdquo; (Song for the Creation of a New Philippines), which temporarily replaced the National Anthem, music by Felipe Padilla de Leon, lyrics by first prize winner Catalino Dionisio; &ldquo;Awit ng Mga Magsasaka&rdquo; (Song of the Farmers), music by F. P. de Leon, lyrics by Simplicio Talens; and &ldquo;President Laurel March,&rdquo; music by Lucio San Pedro, lyrics by Jacinto de Leon. Other composers who won various awards for their compositions were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4153\">Hilarion Rubio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\">Francisco Buencamino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4156\">Lucino Sacramento</a>, and Nemesio Regalado. To encourage excellence in band music, awards were given under the auspices of the Philippine Band Association in 1943. The Muling Pagsikat Band under Rafael Batugal won the top prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Postwar Philippines saw a new phase in the life of the nation&rsquo;s music contests as artists grappled with nation building in their music. Foremost among the music competitions was the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA), established in 1973, which sparked nationwide contests that nurtured the country&rsquo;s young talents in various categories&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a>, voice, choral music, solo, family ensemble, traditional music, and commissioned contest pieces. Created by Proclamation No. 1173, NAMCYA designated a National Music Week in November, with the CCP and the Department of Education as its prime collaborating arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2009, the CCP staged the 1st Philippine International Choral Competition, which took place from 18 to 22 Aug. The festival was part of its 40th anniversary celebration, and it brought choirs from different parts of the Philippines to compete in four categories: Children&rsquo;s Choir, Mixed Choir, Sacred Music, and Folk Music. Not long after, the Andrea O. Veneracion International Choral Festival 2013 was launched to celebrate the 50th founding anniversary of the Philippine Madrigal Singers, the choir that Veneracion, a National Artist, nurtured to become the world-class ensemble that it is today. It was held from 7-10 Aug, a month after the passing of Veneracion. A total of five foreign choirs from Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, and 14 Filipino choirs competed in three categories. The second edition of this international choral competition was held from 22-25 Jul 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many other choral competitions have been held, and among those which have lasted through the years include Voices in Harmony, a competition for high school choirs organized by the Children&rsquo;s Museum and Library, Inc (CMLI) which began in 1999; the annual Musikahan sa Tagum, sponsored by the city government of Tagum and the City of Tagum Tourism Office since 1999, which includes competitions for choirs, band, singing, and rondalla; the MBC Choral Competition, organized by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4895\">Manila Broadcasting Company</a> since 2007; Musica FEUROPA, the only European Union-sponsored choral competition in the Philippines, hosted by the Far Eastern University since 2009; and the annual Government Choral Competition, a Civil Service Commission-sponsored competition for choirs of government agencies which held its first edition in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another festival held regularly at the CCP is the International Guitar Festival and Competition. It began in 2010, organized by Guitar Friends, a group of Filipino guitar aficionados, and the CCP. In its 2011 competition, Filipino guitarist Ramoncito Carpio won the first prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the CCP-initiated festivals, there is the Kundiman Fiesta sponsored by Hotel Nikko Manila Garden in Makati which began in 1991. The goal of the festival was to revive the singing of the Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><b>kundiman</b></a> and propagate this singing tradition among the youth. The first five years were financed by the hotel management and produced the following top kundiman singers: Francisco Batomalaque, 1991; Alexis Sumicat, 1992; Nolito Gregorio, 1993; Joel Saavedra, 1994; and Cherry Batalla, 1995. When the ownership of Hotel Nikko changed in 1996, the annual Kundiman Fiesta faced an uncertain fate. The NCCA eventually took over, and the 1996 edition was held on 4 Dec at the Folk Arts Theater, with Marya Deeda Barreto as the winner. The Makati Coliseum and Cultural Affairs Office started another kundiman singing competition in 1995 to celebrate &ldquo;Buwan ng Wika&rdquo; (Language Month) in Makati City. The competition was aptly called &ldquo;Kampeon ng Kundiman&rdquo; and was later on renamed &ldquo;Kundiman sa Makati.&rdquo; It has been held annually ever since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A contest of semiclassical tradition was the Yamaha Electone Festival (YEF) held from 1972 to the late 1990s, which showcased the capability of the electronic organ to replicate the sound of an entire orchestra, traditional instrumental ensemble, or popular bands. Aside from original compositions for the Electone, the festival required the participants to display their arrangements and improvisational skills during the competition. The festival&rsquo;s national champion represented the country in the Southeast Asian regional competition, and those who won in the regional contest advanced to the International Electone Concours, which was always held in Japan. Many YEF winners have become prominent contributors to the country&rsquo;s music industry such as Francisco &ldquo;Toti&rdquo; Fuentes, Maritess Salientes, Carolyn Kleiner-Cheng, Louie Ocampo, Rowena Arietta, Maria Corazon &ldquo;Maricor&rdquo; Perez, Norman Agatep, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4517\">Jesse Lucas</a>, Marvin Queirdo, Pipo Cifra, Rica Arambulo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3870\">Noel Arce</a>, Charisse Baldoria, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4380\">Khavn de la Cruz</a>, Arwin Tan, Dennis Sugarol, and Jude Roldan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contests in the field of popular music have been led by the Metro Manila Popular Music Festival (Metropop) established in 1978 under the auspices of the Popular Music Foundation and led by Imee Marcos and Teodoro Valencia. The most prestigious pop music contest of its time, it came at a period when national pride in music was ardently felt, thus inspiring the growth of Original Pilipino Music (OPM). Winners included Ryan Cayabyab for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/915\">&ldquo;Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika&rdquo;</a> (How Beautiful Is Our Music), Freddie Aguilar for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\">&ldquo;Anak&rdquo;</a> (Child) and &ldquo;Bulag, Pipi at Bingi&rdquo; (Blind, Mute, and Deaf), Louie Ocampo and Rowena Arrieta for &ldquo;Ewan&rdquo; (I Don&rsquo;t Know), Odette Quesada for &ldquo;Give Me a Chance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Till I Met You,&rdquo; Nonong Pedero for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/959\">&ldquo;Narito Ako&rdquo;</a> (Here I Am) and &ldquo;Isang Mundo, Isang Awit&rdquo; (One World, One Song), George Canseco for &ldquo;Ako ang Nagwagi, Ako ang Nasawi&rdquo; (I Won, I Lost), Ananias Montano for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/856\">&ldquo;Babae Ka&rdquo;</a> (You&rsquo;re a Girl), Gines Tan for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/935\">&ldquo;Magsimula Ka&rdquo;</a> (Make a Start), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4002\">Gary Granada</a> for &ldquo;Salamat, Salamat Musika&rdquo; (Thanks, Music). Although it launched the careers of many aspiring songwriters and produced an avalanche of OPM, the Metropop lasted only until 1985 as the end of the Marcos regime neared. It was revived in 1996 as the Metropop Song Fest, which lasted until 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Launched on 15 Feb 2012 was the Philippine Pop Music Festival (PhilPop) Songwriting Competition which aimed to encourage Filipinos to create music that could become classic hits. The competition is organized and sponsored by a group of companies owned by business tycoon Manuel V. Pangilinan. The first grand prize winner was Karl Villuga with his song &ldquo;Bawat Hakbang&rdquo; (Every Step), interpreted in the 2012 festival by Mark Bautista and the Akafellas. In its 2013 edition, the top winners were Thyro Alfaro and Yumi Lacsamana with their song &ldquo;Dati&rdquo; (Before), interpreted by Tippy Dos Santos and Sam Concepcion. In 2014, the grand prizewinner was veteran Jungee Marcelo with his song &ldquo;Salbabida&rdquo; (Lifesaver), interpreted by Kyla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Recent music competitions include the Kapisanan ng Mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas (KBP) Pop Music Festival in 2010 which uniquely took place over the airwaves and aimed to generate new Filipino songs; the Philippine Popular Music Festival in 2012 which aired over TV5, and whose entries won by number of text votes; and the Manila Broadcasting Company&rsquo;s choral contests, held under the auspices of the largest radio network in Asia, which draws school ensembles from all over the country. A music contest with the goal of giving thanks and praise to God is the ASOP (A Song of Praise Music Festival), which receives song entries from the Philippines and overseas, is streamed live on <a href=\"http://www.untvweb.com/\">www.untvweb.com</a>, and is covered internationally by UNTV 37.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ABS-CBN Corporation and its music subsidiary, Star Music, have their own songwriting and music video competition known as Himig Handog. The contest initially ran from 2000 to 2003 and had varying themes in each year. It was discontinued after 2003 but was revived in 2013 as Himig Handog Pinoy Pop Love Songs, with romantic love as the primary theme of all song-entries. The grand winner of the 2013 competition was Jovinor Tan and his song &ldquo;Anong Nangyari Sa Ating Dalawa?&rdquo; as interpreted by Aiza Seguerra.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\"><strong>Antonio C.

				"value": "The National Artist Award, established under Presidential Proclamation No. 1001 on 27 Apr 1972 to honor Filipinos who have made outstanding contributions to Philippine arts and letters, replaced the Republic Cultural Heritage Award. It was later amended through Presidential Proclamation No. 1144 issued on 15 May 1973, creating a National Artists Award Committee to administer the conferment of the honor. It is now the highest and most prestigious award that the government gives to musicians and other artists. The following have been named National Artists for Music: Antonio J. Molina, 1973, who &#x201C;pioneered in transmuting native melodies and rhythms into musical compositions of great originality and force&#x201D;; Jovita Fuentes, 1976, for &#x201C;her mastery of the noblest musical instrument, the voice, which continues to inspire and invigorate the musical development of the country&#x201D;; Honorata &#x201C;Atang&#x201D; de la Rama, 1987, for &#x201C;her sincere devotion to original theater and music, her outstanding artistry as singer and as <a href=\"/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a><b> </b>actor-playwright-producer,&#x201D; and for &#x201C;her tireless efforts to bring her art to all regions and sectors of Filipino society and to the world&#x201D;; Antonino R. Buenaventura, 1988, for keeping &#x201C;the nationalist tradition alive in his works by espousing the great possibilities of our indigenous music tradition in creating a distinct Philippine sound&#x201D;; Lucrecia R. Kasilag, 1990, &#x201C;[whose] devotion to her art &#x2026; has added important new dimensions to our musical traditions, earning the respect and admiration of many&#x201D;; Lucio D. San Pedro, 1991, for &#x201C;his musical philosophy of &#x2018;creative nationalism&#x2019; [which] entails an imaginative and emotional interaction between the artist and his culture&#x201D;; Felipe Padilla de Leon, 1997, for having &#x201C;achieved a keen understanding and oneness with the soul of his people such that his music breathes its very essence&#x201D;; Levi Celerio, 1997, for being a &#x201C;poet for the man-on-the-street who easily relates to him and his works, a true artist of the people &#x2026; reaching out to the ordinary Filipino&#x201D;; Jose Maceda, 1997, for having &#x201C;dedicated his life towards the promotion of a national cultural identity, initiating and inspiring the scholarly study of the music and culture of the Filipino minority groups&#x201D;; <a href=\"/5/42/3950\">Ernani Cuenco</a>, 1999, who believed that &#x201C;music unheard was as good as music not created at all&#x201D;; Andrea O. Veneracion, 1999, for having &#x201C;consistently kept the Philippine Madrigal Singers&#x2019; hallmark of excellence, and for establishing a tradition of fine choral singing in the Philippines&#x201D;; Francisco Feliciano, 2014, for having &#x201C;brought the wealth of indigenous Philippine culture to the musical stages of the world&#x201D;; Ramon P. Santos, 2014, whose body of works highlight the &#x201C;people-specific concepts central to the ethnomusicological discipline, the translation of indigenous musical systems into modern musical discourse, and the marriage of Western and non-Western sound&#x201D;; and Ryan Cayabyab, 2018,"

National Artists are recommended by the Board of Trustees of the CCP, and since 1989, also by the Presidential (now National) Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), and declared by the President. In 2003, EO No. 236 was signed which established the honors code of the Philippines to create an order of precedence of honors conferred and for other purposes. By virtue of this EO, the National Artist Award became the Orden ng mga Pambansang Alagad ng Sining (Order of National Artists), with revised privileges and honors. The cash award was increased to 100,000 for living awardees and 75,000 for posthumous awardees; so, too, the monthly life pension and medical and hospitalization benefits. Life insurance coverage was given to awardees who were still insurable. Also sustained were arrangements and expenses for a state funeral and burial at the Libingan ng mga Bayani (Cemetery of Heroes); a place of honor, in line with protocol, at national state functions, and acknowledgment at cultural events."

Composition more specifically signifies the creative activity and the created work or opus in the context of art music in the European tradition, with reference to the notated score and its realization and interpretation by performers. Arnold Schoenberg, a leading Austrian composer of the 20th century, cites the different stages involved in the process of composing: the basic idea or <i>grundgestalt</i>, which comes from an extramusical source such as an emotion, a story, an image; the translation of the grundgestalt into a basic musical material or <i>grundreihe</i>, involving the appropriate scale and mode; the creation of the motif or theme; and the development of the theme into a musical form. In general, this limited concept of composition precludes the idea of improvisation and implies the total authority and absolute control of the composer through the written score.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A wider view of composition, however, considers the almost unlimited variety of ways of composing, not only in the modern tradition dominant in 20th-century Western art music but also in the countless musical traditions outside the Western hemisphere. In orally transmitted cultures where the term &ldquo;music&rdquo; or the idea of composer as author and writer does not exist, the compositional process may be manifested in the following ways: the innovation on the musical elements of an actual performance; the extemporized creation of the text on a preexisting tune; the invention of additional episodes or development of plots in epics and other narrative forms; the musical utterances and physical movements in ritualistic trance; the learning, as among the Blackfoot Indians, of a new song through dream; and the transcription and stylization of traditional melodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In some Asian classical traditions, such as the <b>raga</b> and <b>tala </b>of the Hindustani and Carnatic music of India, and the Persian <b>radif </b>and the Arabic <b>maqam</b>, composition occurs as improvisation of existing modal melodies and rhythmic patterns during the performance of the music. In Javanese classical music, basic melodies or themes called <b>balungan </b>are composed according to the six modes of the two-scale systems of <b>pelog </b>and <b>slendro</b>,<b> </b>and using any of the 19 compositional formats or <b>ghending</b>.<b> </b>These melodies are then realized in the semi-improvised playing technique of the gamelan<b> </b>or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gong</a>-chime <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestra</a>. In Thai music, melodies are composed, incorporating both traditional themes as well as structural elements from foreign music (e.g., Khmer, Lao, Chinese). These are then realized by means of variant techniques by standard performing ensembles such as <b>piphad</b>, <b>mohori</b>, and <b>khruang sai</b>. In modern China, composition also means the transcription and scoring of collected tunes from tribal music repertoires for various types of instrumental ensembles.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">The traditional differs greatly from the modern concept of composition. In the traditional, the element of improvisation and extemporization is a major part of the creative process; there is little distinction between composer and performer; innovations and inventions are based on preexisting materials and rules of style; moreover, the spirit world may also be directly involved in the compositional act.</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In unwritten vocal genres, composition is the creation of the text on preexisting melodic formulae which, together with the stylistic elements in their musical rendition usually determine the genres, as in the <b>oggayam</b><i> </i>or the welcome song of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>. Other genres are specific to social activities such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> <b>huluna </b>(lullaby), and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a> <b>sowe-ey </b>(agricultural song). There are also musical forms that are related to important events such as weddings, peace pacts, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">Epic</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">s</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballads</a> are rendered only by elders who are regarded to have greater artistic character and philosophical depth than ordinary members of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A piece may sometimes be &ldquo;titled&rdquo; or identified either by its composer or by its thematic content, as in the case of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a> <b>ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>a poetic musical form sung on various occasions, from small gatherings to big celebrations. E.L. Pungayan classifies ba-diw into five categories: <b>batbat</b> or <b>pinchitan ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>for big feasts; <b>kapi</b><i> </i><b>ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>for thanksgiving rites and good fortune; <b>pinatjan ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>for death wakes; <b>ngilin ba-diw</b>,<b> </b>for weddings; and <b>adadkos ba-diw</b><i> </i>for entertainment and storytelling. The ba-diw is sung in leader-chorus style. The <i>man-badiw</i><b> </b>(elderly male), is the leader-composer-poet, and the <i>asbayat </i>(a chorus of women) echoes each line that is half-recited by the man-badiw. A ba-diw composer must be skilled not only in reciting extempore seven-syllable-line poetry on a specific theme but also in developing his own imagery, metaphorical language, and different ways of incorporating Ibaloy values related to the spirit world, material wealth, cultural identity, creativity, and sense of humor. These skills are acquired by listening to and memorizing individual phrases or entire pieces as sung by experts. Selected ba-diw are remembered either through the authors, such as &ldquo;Ba-diw ni Dasolas&rdquo; (Ba-diw of Dasolas) and &ldquo;Ba-diw ni Bab&rsquo;an Berong&rdquo; (Ba-diw of Bab&rsquo;an Berong), with cross-reference to the occasions when they were heard; or through specific categories, as in &ldquo;Ba-diw ni Abiteg&rdquo; (The Poor Man&rsquo;s Bad-iw), with cross-reference, too, to the authors and/or occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The process of creating other vocal forms, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> <b>bayok</b>,<b> </b>involves not only composing a text extemporaneously but also putting together various vocal style formulae such as <b>ringkaran </b>or vocal ornaments, to support the text. The bayok is a hyperbolic panegyric composition. A good <b>pabubayok </b>(bayok singer) must be able to manipulate the different formulae skillfully, and to sing about any topic employing proverbs, adages, and puns, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vocal genres from other cultural groups in the Philippines also possess extemporized text on melodic and stylistic formulae. The genres include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a> <b>kulilal</b>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> <b>sinaleg </b>and <b>palagi</b>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> <b>dal-lot</b>, the Tagalog <b>pandangguhan</b>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><b>balitaw</b></a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> <b>siyasid </b>and <b>seringan</b>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> <b>awa-idi</b>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> <b>composo</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the indigenous instrumental repertoires, the integration of artistic creation and performance is also the fundamental process of music composition, consisting mainly of improvising preexisting structural elements (melodic and rhythmic modes) and musical forms. Since many of the instrumental forms are as open-ended as the occasions and social events that they enhance or the specific activities of which they are an integral part, the limits of the creative act can be indefinite in duration and substance. The improvisation may take the form of ornamentation, repetition, variations, and permutations of the thematic, rhythmic, and tonal (timbre) elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The musical forms suggest the possible manners of improvisation. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> <b>kuriri</b>,<b> </b>for example, is a continuous series of three- to four-note motifs representing different shades of emotions and feelings. Changes and permutations are made in the rhythmic patterns and note sequences without deviating from a basic pulse, especially in solo instrumental music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a> <b>kulintangan </b>music, the formal element may be based on a series of phrases as well as rhythmic formulae, like the <b>duyug</b>, <b>sinulug</b>, <b>tidtu</b>, <b>binalig</b>, and/or on existing songs like &ldquo;Mamayug&rdquo; and &ldquo;Layas sa Ulan.&rdquo; The phrases are repeated and modified any number of times at the discretion of the kulintang<b> </b>player who cues the other members of the ensemble especially in the opening and closing sequences. In other ensemble music such as the Kalinga <b>gangsa palook</b><i> </i>and Tiruray <b>agung</b>,<b> </b>only one or two members improvise, while the others play constant patterns which provide the drone element. In pre-Christian ensemble music, one gong is usually the drone such as the <b>babandir</b><i> </i>in the Maguindanaon and Maranao kulintangan, the <b>patawaganan</b><i> </i>in the <b>tagunggo</b><i> </i>of the Kalagan, and the <b>bandilan</b><i> </i>of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> hanging kulintang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pre-Western concepts of composition were gradually replaced by changes in the melodies themselves to accommodate novel elements from Western music such as harmony, counterpoint, chordal accompaniment, and dance rhythms. These musical changes are evident in the various vocal music of rural Christian cultures such as the Tagalog <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\"><b>awit</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><b>kumintang</b></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/787\"><b>pandanggo</b></a>,<b> </b>and the Visayan <b>composo</b> and <b>balitaw</b>. The next stage of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\">folk song</a> evolution is represented by the actual composition of new melodies for individual texts as seen in &ldquo;Kundiman de 1800&rdquo; (Kundiman of 1800) or the highly stylized reconstruction of traditional musical forms according to Western harmonic idioms. Many of Philippine Westernized folk songs are in either major or minor modes and cast in three-beat patterns as influenced by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/770\"><b>valse</b></a>,<b> </b>pandanggo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/780\">jota</a><b> </b>rhythms, or in the two-beat patterns of the danza<b> </b>or the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/777\">habanera</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The variable-text concept of composition appears to be the norm not only in folk songs and folk epics but also in literary-musical genres such as the metrical romances called awit<b> </b>and <b>korido</b>,<b> </b>and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a><b> </b>in which the composed music for standard parts (dances and battle scenes) can be interchanged between different works. It is quite evident that in these forms, the music is incidental to the literary content. The same is true for other dramatic forms. There is a greater collaboration between the dramatist-playwright and the music composer in producing songs which in some instances can stand on their own artistic merit outside the drama itself. It is not uncommon to insert in a particular <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a></em> production songs originally composed for other sarsuwela, especially if these songs were written by the same composer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although popular music writing usually follows the Western compositional concept involving the composer, the written score, and the performer, some works, especially those that belong to the folk ballad category, are composed and performed by the same person, such as the songs of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\">Florante</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3857\">Freddie </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3857\">Aguilar</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3899\">Heber Bartolome</a>. The folk ballad type is usually set in simple tunes in strophic form. Because of its semi-narrative, semi-declarative character, its literary-poetic content, more often than not, carries greater artistic value than the music itself. Thus, this type of folk music is widely used as a medium of protest and serious political statements. Some folk ballad composers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4102\">Grace Nono</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3850\">Edru Abraham</a> integrate indigenous music in their works. In many of the comic-didactic folk ballads of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\">Yoyoy Villame</a>, the music is less significant in that it is hardly original, as it is usually lifted from the popular dance music repertoire of the American colonial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of Filipino popular music composers who lack background in music notation employ arrangers. The use of tape recorders and other electronic devices for sound storage and preprogrammed music or minus one have also been put to good use by nonliterate pop music composers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In recent years, the use of Philippine languages in popular music and the production of Filipino-composed tunes have given rise to <b>OPM</b> or original Pilipino music. Composition in Philippine art music, on the other hand, adopts the principles of the European art music tradition. The flowering of the Filipino composer produced classical art music works: masses, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/798\">symphonies</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/795\">sonatas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\">concertos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/772\">chamber music</a>, concert overtures and tone poems, song cycles, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\">kundiman</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/768\">art songs</a>, preludes, and character pieces. Western compositional skills consist of a working knowledge of functional harmony, counterpoint, orchestration, other forms of choral and instrumental writing techniques, as well as stylistic devices relative to vocal and individual instrumental idioms. The principal composers identified with the art music literature which flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\">Ladislao Bonus</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\">Marcelo Adonay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4084\">Antonio J. Molina</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4008\">Juan S. Hernandez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\">Francisco Buencamino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4153\">Hilarion F. Rubio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4162\">Lucio D. San Pedro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\">Eliseo M. Pajaro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3965\">Felipe Padilla de Leon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4156\">Lucino T. Sacramento</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3914\">Alfredo S. Buenaventura</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4166\">Rosendo Santos</a>. These composers utilize the forms mainly as a medium for expressing programmatic ideas based on Filipino themes and nationalist ideology as exemplified by the <b><i>Taga-ilog Symphony</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the <b><i>Mayon</i></b> <b><i><strong>Concerto</strong></i></b>,<i> </i>the symphonic poem <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/921\"><strong>Lahing Kayumanggi</strong></a></i></b> (Brown Race), the <b><i>Daklahi Symphony</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and the opera <b><i><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong> </i></b>(Touch Me Not). Structural motifs taken from folk songs are common source elements in these works. Purely abstract compositions without allusion to or quotation of Filipino materials are rare in Philippine classical music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New compositional concepts and techniques which evolved in 20th-century Western art music were also selectively adopted and modified by Filipino composers. The proliferation of different stylistic idioms, such as impressionism, expressionism, neoclassicism, and the various streams of thought in the avant-garde movement from the 1950s to the 1970s further enriched the compositional base of Filipino creative artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ambiguous tonal language of expressionist music was absorbed by Nicanor S. Abelardo in the latter part of his creative career, as can be heard in <b><i>Sinfonietta</i></b> and the <b><i>Cinderella Overture</i></b>, while the textural devices of the impressionists were adopted by Antonino Buenaventura and Antonio J. Molina. The neoclassicist idea of putting together old and new materials of music was espoused by Eliseo M. Pajaro, Rosendo Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4072\">Manuel P. Maramba, OSB</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4117\">Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\">Lucrecia R. Kasilag</a>. Kasilag expanded the neoclassic idiom by fusing non-Western music elements, specifically Asian tones and scales, with standard western melodic and harmonic structures. Other Filipino composers such as Alfredo S. Buenaventura and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3954\">Jerry A. Dadap</a> are more eclectic in their compositional perspective, relating the different musical idioms to different feelings and emotions. Thus, the application of particular styles of composition is based on programmatic and descriptive, rather than linguistic considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The techniques of composition that developed out of the avant-garde movement also found a place in the works of Filipino composers. Composing with mass sound structures as those initiated by the French <b>musique concrete</b> movement serves as the basic formula for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\">Jose Maceda</a>&rsquo;s sound murals, as in his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1024\"><strong>Ugnayan</strong></a></i> </b>(Coordination) and<i> <b>Udlot-Udlot</b></i> (Fluctuation). Here, microstructural materials are taken from the sound repertoire of Philippine indigenous instruments such as gongs, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/832\">bamboo zithers</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/826\">scrapers</a>, as well as vocal techniques like vocal slides and glottal stops. A similar approach to composition has been adopted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\">Jonas Baes</a> whose works, like <b><i>Basbasan </i></b>(Blessing)<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Yayeyunan </i></b>(Melody), are inspired by both Maceda&rsquo;s music and his own researches in Philippine indigenous music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Improvisation, open forms, and graphic notation are elements of composition employed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\">Ramon P. Santos</a> in his early works like <b><i>Time Improvisation</i></b>,<b><i> Five</i> <i>Pieces for Two Pianos</i></b>,<b><i> Radyasyon </i></b>(Radiation), and <b><i>Nabasag ang <strong>Banga</strong> </i></b>(The Jar Was Broken); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4197\">Chino Toledo</a> in his <b><i>Samut-sari </i></b>(Variety), <b><i>Terminal Lamentation</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Baryasyon</i></b> (Variation);<b><i> </i></b>and Kasilag in her <b><i>Five</i> <i>Portraits </i></b>and<b><i> Ekologie I: On A Day Off</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Compositions based on non-Western structural elements such as hocket technique, rhythmic patterns, drones, and heterophony are seen in Ruben R. Federizon&rsquo;s <b><i>Ritmos Tabulare </i></b>(Tabular Rhythm)<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1018\"><strong>Tinig ng Lupa</strong></a> </i></b>(Voice of the Earth); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3962\">Verne dela Pe&ntilde;a</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Nyuma </i></b>and <b><i>Panaghoy </i></b>(Lamentation); Ramon P.

Feliciano</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Siya-Kuno </i></b>(As If, also a play on the word &ldquo;chaconne&rdquo;); Arlene Chongson&rsquo;s <b><i>Lunduyan </i></b>(Center);<b><i> </i></b>and Kristina Benitez&rsquo;s works. Sound layers and a rich variety of sound textures that are generated from small nuclear cells are characteristic of the works of Francisco F. Feliciano in his <b><i>Isostasie III</i></b>,<b><i> Die Verkl&auml;erung Christi</i></b>,<b><i> Fragments</i></b>,<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/205\"><strong>Yerma</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>and the opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a> </i></b>(The Black She-wolf); and Conrado del Rosario in his <b><i><strong>Chant</strong>s</i></b>. Moreover, Robin Estrada&rsquo;s choral pieces such as <b><i><strong>Awit</strong> sa Panginoon </i></b>(Song for God) resound chant elements and ritual-based structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The integration of various artistic elements (poetry, music, dance, visual design) has been realized in a number of multimedia works which have been composed in the spirit of artistic holism in traditional art forms. This repertoire continues to grow today, as seen in such works as Ramon P. Santos&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1003\"><strong>Siklo</strong></a> </i></b>(Cycle), <b><i>Daragang Magayon </i></b>(Beautiful Maiden) and <b><i>Awit ni Pulau </i></b>(Song of Pulau); Chino Toledo&rsquo;s <b><i>Dasalan at Toksohan </i></b>(Praying and Teasing);<b><i> </i></b>and Verne dela Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Urduja </i></b>and <b><i>Agueda</i></b>. Interlocking rhythms usually found in the ensemble music of northern Philippines&rsquo; indigenous groups were employed in the urban soundscape piece of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4092\">Maria Christine Muyco</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ikotoki for</i></b> <b><i>Jeepney Orchestra</i></b>, a multimedia piece involving instruments made from parts of the jeepney (the Philippine&rsquo;s public vehicle), speech choir, dance, and actual jeepneys and their drivers participating in music making. On the other hand, Mary Katherine Trangco&rsquo;s <b><i>Elira</i> </b>comprises the use of choir, shadow dance, and gong instruments. In this piece, she shows her multitasking ability as performer, that is, conducting while chanting part of her piece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are participative and interactive pieces written that invoke deep sociopolitical consciousness among performers and audience such as Jonas Baes&rsquo;s compositions. His <b><i>InAyta</i> </b>involves issues on loss of ancestral land, and <b><i>Lisan</i></b> essays the Iraya <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a>&rsquo;s exodus as a result of land displacement, armed conflict, and other encroachments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Collaborations of artists across countries result to fruitful endeavors such as Lily Anne Perez&rsquo;s <b><i>In Search of Kwan and Ocho Ocho (Barrionics)</i></b>,<b> </b>which she accomplished with artists from the Philippines and the United States. These pieces involve installations, theatre, dance, video, and computer music. In the same light, Dennis Reyes employs electronic technology in his compositions such as the <b><i>Dance of the Monkey King</i></b> and <b><i>Bolgia,</i> </b>performed in series of Asian Composers League international festivals. Other works of Filipino composers using electro-acoustic and computer technology are uploaded in SoundCloud and other online websites for listening access. Electronic music compositions have been around not only in the academe but among experimental groups as well. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3533\">Tad Ermita&ntilde;o</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Deus Ex Machina</i></b> and Tengal Drilon&rsquo;s <b><i>30 Sounds in a Filing Cabinet</i></b><i> </i>are some of the pieces that involve interactive technology and media art. Ermitano has also worked with members of The Children of Cathode Ray, an experimental media group. This group has been performing his works, which in context, become his partners in recreating structures and ideas.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ramon P.

Composition more specifically signifies the creative activity and the created work or opus in the context of art music in the European tradition, with reference to the notated score and its realization and interpretation by performers. Arnold Schoenberg, a leading Austrian composer of the 20th century, cites the different stages involved in the process of composing: the basic idea or <i>grundgestalt</i>, which comes from an extramusical source such as an emotion, a story, an image; the translation of the grundgestalt into a basic musical material or <i>grundreihe</i>, involving the appropriate scale and mode; the creation of the motif or theme; and the development of the theme into a musical form. In general, this limited concept of composition precludes the idea of improvisation and implies the total authority and absolute control of the composer through the written score."

In orally transmitted cultures where the term &#x201C;music&#x201D; or the idea of composer as author and writer does not exist, the compositional process may be manifested in the following ways: the innovation on the musical elements of an actual performance; the extemporized creation of the text on a preexisting tune; the invention of additional episodes or development of plots in epics and other narrative forms; the musical utterances and physical movements in ritualistic trance; the learning, as among the Blackfoot Indians, of a new song through dream; and the transcription and stylization of traditional melodies."

These are then realized by means of variant techniques by standard performing ensembles such as <b>piphad</b>, <b>mohori</b>, and <b>khruang sai</b>. In modern China, composition also means the transcription and scoring of collected tunes from tribal music repertoires for various types of instrumental ensembles."

The principal composers identified with the art music literature which flourished in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are <a href=\"/5/42/3910\">Ladislao Bonus</a>, <a href=\"/5/42/3855\">Marcelo Adonay</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>, <a href=\"/5/42/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/4084\">Antonio J. Molina</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/4008\">Juan S. Hernandez</a>, <a href=\"/5/42/3917\">Francisco Buencamino</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/4153\">Hilarion F. Rubio</a>, <a href=\"/5/42/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/4162\">Lucio D. San Pedro</a>, <a href=\"/5/42/4111\">Eliseo M. Pajaro</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/3965\">Felipe Padilla de Leon</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/4156\">Lucino T. Sacramento</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/3914\">Alfredo S. Buenaventura</a>, and <a href=\"/5/42/4166\">Rosendo Santos</a>. These composers utilize the forms mainly as a medium for expressing programmatic ideas based on Filipino themes and nationalist ideology as exemplified by the <b><i>Taga-ilog Symphony</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>the <b><i>Mayon</i></b> <b><i><strong>Concerto</strong></i></b>,<i> </i>the symphonic poem <b><i><a href=\"/5/40/921\"><strong>Lahing Kayumanggi</strong></a></i></b> (Brown Race), the <b><i>Daklahi Symphony</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and the opera <b><i><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong> </i></b>(Touch Me Not). Structural motifs taken from folk songs are common source elements in these works. Purely abstract compositions without allusion to or quotation of Filipino materials are rare in Philippine classical music."

The proliferation of different stylistic idioms, such as impressionism, expressionism, neoclassicism, and the various streams of thought in the avant-garde movement from the 1950s to the 1970s further enriched the compositional base of Filipino creative artists."

Abelardo in the latter part of his creative career, as can be heard in <b><i>Sinfonietta</i></b> and the <b><i>Cinderella Overture</i></b>, while the textural devices of the impressionists were adopted by Antonino Buenaventura and Antonio J. Molina. The neoclassicist idea of putting together old and new materials of music was espoused by Eliseo M. Pajaro, Rosendo Santos, <a href=\"/5/5/4072\">Manuel P. Maramba, OSB</a>, <a href=\"/5/5/4117\">Angel M. Pe&#xF1;a</a>, and <a href=\"/5/42/4030\">Lucrecia R. Kasilag</a>. Kasilag expanded the neoclassic idiom by fusing non-Western music elements, specifically Asian tones and scales, with standard western melodic and harmonic structures. Other Filipino composers such as Alfredo S. Buenaventura and <a href=\"/5/5/3954\">Jerry A. Dadap</a> are more eclectic in their compositional perspective, relating the different musical idioms to different feelings and emotions. Thus, the application of particular styles of composition is based on programmatic and descriptive, rather than linguistic considerations."

Composing with mass sound structures as those initiated by the French <b>musique concrete</b> movement serves as the basic formula for <a href=\"/5/42/4056\">Jose Maceda</a>&#x2019;s sound murals, as in his <b><i><a href=\"/5/40/1024\"><strong>Ugnayan</strong></a></i> </b>(Coordination) and<i> <b>Udlot-Udlot</b></i> (Fluctuation). Here, microstructural materials are taken from the sound repertoire of Philippine indigenous instruments such as gongs, <a href=\"/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>, <a href=\"/5/37/832\">bamboo zithers</a>, <a href=\"/5/37/826\">scrapers</a>, as well as vocal techniques like vocal slides and glottal stops. A similar approach to composition has been adopted by <a href=\"/5/42/3885\">Jonas Baes</a> whose works, like <b><i>Basbasan </i></b>(Blessing)<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Yayeyunan </i></b>(Melody), are inspired by both Maceda&#x2019;s music and his own researches in Philippine indigenous music."

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Music criticism is the subjective evaluation of a musical work or performance based on the experience of the writer. This interpretation may emerge from a music analysis, which deals with music&rsquo;s formal properties, or from historical and cultural facts, which would provide contextual meanings. Music criticism fundamentally differs from all other types of musicological writings because it emphasizes how a piece of music is perceived, heard, or felt by a listener who then shares his or her musical experience in writing to a reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music criticism may be classified into two kinds, both of which are practiced in the Philippines: (a) the academic or specialized music criticism, found in scholarly journals, periodicals, or books, and (b) the general or what can be called performance review, which is published in newspapers or popular magazines. Normally, criticism of both kinds should position a new work or its performance in relation to existing genre conventions, emphasizing its status with respect to the repertoire of which such work or performance is a part of, and in reference to the composer&rsquo;s other works as well as to other related compositions. It requires attention to musical details such as elements and forms, and utilizes a specialized technical vocabulary.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Criticism of the first kind is an elucidation of a work or performance, written by the few musicologists and academics in the country. Published in refereed journals and books, it is characterized by an examination of a work or a performance, usually discussing its formalistic content and employing a theoretical framework to validate the scholarly approach of the critic&rsquo;s analysis. It is intended to be read by people who are interested in the uniqueness and artistry of such work or performance as this was or is primarily experienced. Such criticism may bring in as well the work&rsquo;s relation to the historical, sociopolitical, and cultural circumstances that would further enrich the appreciation of the evaluated piece or performance. It requires the critic to have a comprehensive technical training, particularly in music theory and history; a systematic usage of musical vocabulary; a comprehensive and deep knowledge of repertories; a firm grasp of theoretical frameworks; a high regard for scholarship; and an unquestionable esteem for the art of music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second type of criticism is the performance review which is written for the general audience, and therefore, disseminated by the mass media. Normally, it reports the critic&rsquo;s experience of the musical event, usually containing information about the composition and its historical and cultural contexts, with the goal of offering an understanding of the musical performance to the public. The principal task of a critic of this kind is to interpret in lay terms an artist&rsquo;s performance of a work, commenting on its manner of interpretation and impact, especially its relationship to style and repertoire. Ideally, the critic for this type possesses the same qualifications as those writing scholarly reviews, and in addition, the ability to popularize his or her ideas. In the Philippines, some music critics or reviewers for periodicals are trained formally or informally in music; others, sadly, only have a nodding acquaintance with music. Writers with training generally expound with equal ease on all kinds of performed music, from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/772\">chamber</a> to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/798\">symphonic</a> to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">band</a>, from solo instrumental pieces to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">music theater</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Academic criticism appears in refereed journals such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1041\"><strong>Musika Jornal</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>,<b><i> Asian Studies</i></b>,<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/524\"><strong>Bulawan</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> Budhi</i></b>, <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i></b><i><u style=\"text-underline:black thick\">,</u><b> Perspectives in the Arts and Humanities</b></i>, and <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>. Two examples of academic criticism using different approaches on a range of musical subjects are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3918\">Jose Buenconsejo</a>&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;Dances and Hostility and Friendship: Embodied Histories of Group Relations in the Agusan-Manobo Spirit Possession&rdquo; in <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>, 2001, which explores indigenous songs in the context of Manobo rituals as a way to establish face-to-face relationships between people; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\">Jonas Baes</a>&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Ethnomusicology-or-Could my Study of Songs Help Indigenous Philippine Peoples in Disputes over Ancestral Domain?&rdquo; in <b><i>Perfect Beat: The Pacific Journal of Research into Contemporary Music and Popular Culture</i></b>, 2002, which is on the music of the Iraya <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a> of Mindoro and details the role of music in empowerment, specifically in relation to disputes over their ancestral domain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A fine example of scholarly criticism is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4165\">Ramon Santos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1046\"><b><i>Tunugan: Four <strong>Essay</strong>s on Filipino Music</i></b></a>. This contains the essay &ldquo;Nicanor S. Abelardo: Filipino Classicism in the Art of Music,&rdquo; 2005, which scrutinizes Abelardo&rsquo;s kundiman such as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/956\">&ldquo;Mutya ng Pasig&rdquo;</a> (Maiden of Pasig), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/918\">&ldquo;Kundiman ng Luha&rdquo;</a> (Kundiman of Tears), and &ldquo;Nasaan Ka Irog&rdquo; (Where Are You, Beloved), as well as Abelardo&rsquo;s instrumental works such as &ldquo;Romanza&rdquo; for violoncello, and <b><i><strong>Concerto</strong> in B-flat Minor</i></b>. The essay provides a detailed assessment of Abelardo&rsquo;s harmonic explorations in his attempt to create instrumental compositions that extended classical forms, and songs that are meaningful fusion of poetry and music in his songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second kind of criticism first appeared in the earliest periodicals devoted to music like the short-lived <b><i>La Lira Filipina</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which ran from 2 May 1877 to 27 Feb 1878. This was followed by the publication of the journal <b><i>Revista del Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario de Manila</i></b>, which printed its first musical review on 10 Aug 1879. The first Filipino music critics at the turn of the 20th century were Epifanio de los Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3924\">Fernando Canon</a>, Alfredo Roa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\">Antonio Molina</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5491\">Ignacio Manlapaz</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5664\">Arturo B. Rotor</a> of the <i><strong>Philippines Herald</strong> </i>and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5388\">Francisco B. Icasiano</a> of the <b><i><strong>Tribu</strong>ne </i></b>who wrote in the1920s and 1930s. In the 1930s, composer Felipe Padilla de Leon wrote a column, &ldquo;Musical Corner,&rdquo; for the <b><i>Tribune</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>After World War II, he wrote &ldquo;Music and You&rdquo; for <b><i>Manila Times</i></b>.

This interpretation may emerge from a music analysis, which deals with music&#x2019;s formal properties, or from historical and cultural facts, which would provide contextual meanings. Music criticism fundamentally differs from all other types of musicological writings because it emphasizes how a piece of music is perceived, heard, or felt by a listener who then shares his or her musical experience in writing to a reader."

				"value": "Criticism of the first kind is an elucidation of a work or performance, written by the few musicologists and academics in the country. Published in refereed journals and books, it is characterized by an examination of a work or a performance, usually discussing its formalistic content and employing a theoretical framework to validate the scholarly approach of the critic&#x2019;s analysis. It is intended to be read by people who are interested in the uniqueness and artistry of such work or performance as this was or is primarily experienced. Such criticism may bring in as well the work&#x2019;s relation to the historical, sociopolitical, and cultural circumstances that would further enrich the appreciation of the evaluated piece or performance. It requires the critic to have a comprehensive technical training, particularly in music theory and history; a systematic usage of musical vocabulary; a comprehensive and deep knowledge of repertories; a firm grasp of theoretical frameworks; a high regard for scholarship; and an unquestionable esteem for the art of music."

Normally, it reports the critic&#x2019;s experience of the musical event, usually containing information about the composition and its historical and cultural contexts, with the goal of offering an understanding of the musical performance to the public. The principal task of a critic of this kind is to interpret in lay terms an artist&#x2019;s performance of a work, commenting on its manner of interpretation and impact, especially its relationship to style and repertoire. Ideally, the critic for this type possesses the same qualifications as those writing scholarly reviews, and in addition, the ability to popularize his or her ideas. In the Philippines, some music critics or reviewers for periodicals are trained formally or informally in music; others, sadly, only have a nodding acquaintance with music. Writers with training generally expound with equal ease on all kinds of performed music, from <a href=\"/5/35/772\">chamber</a> to <a href=\"/5/35/798\">symphonic</a> to <a href=\"/5/36/800\">band</a>, from solo instrumental pieces to <a href=\"/7/55/460\">music theater</a>."

This transference may take place in the formalized setting of a classroom or under more natural or informal conditions, but either way serving as an avenue for the transmission of culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>Indigenous Tradition of Informal Music Education</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among indigenous cultural groups, music is adjunct to everyday living, connected with life cycle events as seen through the ceremonies or rituals that celebrate birth, courtship, and marriage, and that give emphasis to healing, curing, and grieving for the dead. It is used to lull babies to sleep, to relax, or to lighten the burden of household chores. It is as a means of driving away evil spirits or thanking the gods. Planting, harvesting, fishing, and hunting are likewise accompanied by musical activity. In the chanted <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, heroes are extolled, genealogies are traced, and moral lessons are imparted. By and large, such music is learned by imitation and immersion. Young children who are surrounded by this music in their daily activities subconsciously absorb the repertoire. This unstructured transmission process takes place continuously in the community, from generation to generation.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> epic singers learn their songs before or during their early teens. Inuk of Tambuyung, the immortal Manobo bard who chanted the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1973\"><strong>Tuwaang</strong></a></i></b> epic, descended from a long line of epic singers. His grandfather had two sons, Inagla and Lumunay, both epic singers. Lumunay was Inuk&rsquo;s father. Inuk&rsquo;s son Kagyo is also an accomplished singer. Since formal teaching is not part of the Manobo culture, the children of epic singers are more likely to become epic singers themselves through constant exposure. However, other interested youngsters with the &ldquo;proper voice&rdquo; may learn from a master in a very informal manner. Banlak and Mahunlayon, two Manobo epic singers, learned their songs by staying and listening to Inuk in his house for several nights. They would return home and practice the song away from their teacher. This type of transmission also occurred in the case of Oyana, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2364\">Mansaka</a> singer, who learned the <b><i>Manggob </i></b>the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the Sulod, Panay Bukidnon, a<i> binukot </i>(kept maiden) is chosen by the elders of the community. The binukot<b><i> </i></b>enjoys great prestige, for it is she who chants the <b><i>Hinilawod </i></b>epic and records in memory all beliefs and rituals of the community.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5327\">Elena Gardoce</a> or Lola Elena, Sulod chanter of the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1878\">Hinilawod</a> </i></b>was anointed binukot<i> </i>when she was 13 years old. Her grandmother, also a<i> </i>binukot, trained her for four hours a day. She was chosen because of her high-pitched voice and her good memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">Gong</a> music, like epic singing, is also learned by imitation. Gongs are highly valued, sometimes considered sacred, and children are normally not allowed to play with these instruments. On the other hand, bamboo is abundant and inexpensive. Thus, children learn the intricate gong patterns they hear by playing these patterns on bamboo instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Cordillera highlands, young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> boys imitate the<b> gangsa</b> (flat gong)<i> </i>rhythms on the<b> patatag</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/831\">bamboo xylophone</a> blades). The two styles of gong playing, namely,<b> gangsa pattong</b> or striking the gongs with a stick, and<b> gangsa toppaya</b> or striking the gongs with the palms, are simulated. One stick is used to strike the<b><i> </i></b>patatag for the pattong style while two sticks, following the palm strokes of two hands, are used for the toppaya style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another example of bamboo as gong substitutes is found among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/824\">Quill-shaped tubes</a> of hard bamboo are used in lieu of the big<b> agung</b> (wide rimmed hanging bossed gong). Young boys practice the difficult agung patterns on the<b> agung tamlang<i> </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/827\">bamboo tube &ldquo;slit drum&rdquo;</a>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among Muslim cultures, a more formalized process of transmission of musical traditions takes place. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> have a highly organized system for imparting their vocal music tradition which entails learning a repertoire of melodies set to prescribed texts. Young girls learn the <b>lugu maulud</b>, a song cycle in Arabic which tells of the birth and life of Mohammed in poetry and prose, from the community <i>lugu</i> teacher, who also works on vocal quality, competitive performance techniques, and stage presence.<i> </i>The usual length of study for the lugu maulud is<i> </i>six months, after which other<b><i> </i></b>lugu traditions like the <b>sail </b>(ritual song),<b> langanbatabata</b> (royal lullaby), and <b>tarasul </b>(homiletic songs) may be learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A similar transmission system is followed for the<b> paggabang </b>(voice with <i>gabbang</i> xylophone),<b> tata gabbang </b>(solo gabbang), and<b> tata biyula </b>(solo biyula) traditions. The teacher, most often male, is a professional musician. He teaches instrumental technique and repertoire. The vocal part is taught aurally, while instrumental instruction is essentially visual and kinetic. A disciple-guru relationship exists between male students and the teacher. The teacher provides room and board to them in exchange for household service. Female students, however, have lessons at prearranged times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third type of transmission in Tausug culture involves learning the <b>tata suling<i> </i></b>and<b> tata saunay </b>traditions. Only the males learn the <b>biyula<i> </i></b>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violin</a>),<b><i> </i>suling</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>), and <b>saunay</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/825\">reed pipe</a>), usually from a relative or a neighbor. This is done sporadically and informally. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, instruction in vocal music is likewise based on the disciple-guru system. The guru is a high-caliber professional singer. He may have as many as three or four apprentices living with him at a time, although two is usually the norm. Text is initially memorized. The various styles of singing these texts are then learned by rote, with the guru singing first, followed by the student. This traditional apprenticeship is termed<i> kasombak</i>. The apprentice, who may be anywhere from 12 to 20 years old, is the<i> morit</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"historical\" name=\"historical\"></a>Historical Notes on Formal Music Education</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the coming of the Spanish colonizers in 1521, efforts at Christianization brought about the introduction of<b> canto llano</b> (Gregorian chant) and<b> canto d&rsquo;organo</b> (polyphonic music). The arrival of the Augustinians in 1569, the Franciscans in 1577, the Jesuits in 1581, the Dominicans in 1587, and the Recollects in 1606, resulted in the establishment of schools in convents and churches all over the islands, where young boys were taught the liturgy and its accompanying music. Thus, in 1606, the Franciscan Fr Juan de Santa Marta founded a seminary in Lumban, Laguna where 400 boys from different towns were trained in singing and playing musical instruments. Earlier accounts describe how young children were taught canto llano and canto d&rsquo;organo as well as how to play musical instruments, together with Christian doctrine, reading, and writing. The Franciscan Francisco de San Antonio noted in his <b><i>Chronicas </i></b>that each town had decent instrumental music and a church choir, and everyone knew how to read notes. This observation was echoed again and again in subsequent reports, journals, and travelogues in the decades that followed. Favorite instruments were the flute, violin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/812\">harp</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>. By the mid-1800s, much mention was made of the excellent bands which performed not only in Manila but in town plazas all over the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A long list of friar musicians who taught in the convent and church schools includes Fr San Pedro Bautista, who was the first to teach Western music to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>; Fr Geronimo Aguilar, who taught Gregorian chant, polyphony, and instruments in Camarines; Fr Juan de Santa Marta, who taught in Lumban, Laguna in 1606; Fr Antonio de Moqueda, who taught in Majayjay, Laguna; Fr Marcelo de San Agustin, who taught in Manila in 1565; Fr Juan Bolivar, who taught in Manila and Panay in 1739; Fr Lorenzo Castelo, who taught in Manila, Ilocos, and Panay in 1718; Fr Ignacio de Jesus, who taught in Guadalupe Church in 1737; Fr Jose de la Virgen, who taught in Bicol, from 1717 to 1767; and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\">Fr Diego Cera</a>, who taught in Las Pi&ntilde;as in 1795.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Colegio de Ni&ntilde;os Tiples de la Santa Iglesia Catedral was established at the behest of the Archbishop of Manila, Juan Angel Rodriguez, who, shortly before his death in 1742, ordered that a boys&rsquo; choir be formed. It became the prototype for the other schools in the islands. The Colegio had a director, vice-director, three music professors, and an academic teacher of primary instruction. Music classes for solfeggio, vocalization, composition, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/820\">organ</a>, and string instruments were given to the young boys. Many noted Filipino musicians such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3993\">Antonio Garcia</a>, Salvador Pi&ntilde;on, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4198\">Fulgencio Tolentino</a>, and Manuel Lopez were graduates of the school. The college was in existence until the outbreak of World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A great many chronicles of the 19th century also speak of the presence of pianos in the homes of the landed and educated gentry in most towns and cities. Young ladies were taught to play the piano by hired teachers who came to their homes to give individual instruction. Both male and female students learned how to play the piano in the <i>colegios</i> of the Spanish period. This system of piano teaching continued in private schools to the American period. In some cases, students would go to their teachers&rsquo; homes for their lessons. Today, however, with the existence of many professional music schools, this type of instruction has declined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American colonial government established the public school system all over the islands. As early as August 1898, seven schools were established in Manila and many more followed, so that at the turn of the century, over 100,000 Filipino children were enrolled in public schools. American soldiers served as the first public school teachers and were later replaced by the Thomasites<s>,</s> American teachers who came aboard the USS Thomas. In the first decade of the 20th century, young talented Filipinos were sent to the United States as <i>pensionados </i>or scholars. Upon their return, they also assumed teaching and administrative positions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the elementary school level, music instruction was limited mostly to the development of singing skills based on material contained in the four-volume <b><i>Progressive Music Series</i></b>, 1924, by Horatio Parker et al., and a Philippine edition of the same series by Charles E. Griffith and Norberto Romualdez. These books were graded anthologies containing folk songs from different countries, some classical works, and contributions by American and Filipino composers. Similar anthologies were subsequently introduced: <b><i>Singing and Growing for Primary Grades</i></b>, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\">Ramon Tapales</a>, 1952, and <b><i>Sing and Be Happy</i></b>, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5565\">Jose Villa Panganiban</a>, 1966.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1982, the Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) prescribed a New Elementary School Curriculum (MEC-ORDER No. 6) which included among its objectives the &ldquo;development of basic understanding about Philippine culture and the acquisition of fundamental knowledge, habits and skills &hellip; in culture, history, and arts.&rdquo; The new guidelines provided that for the Grade 1 and 2 levels, music would be part of an integrated teaching strategy, serving as a supplementary medium of instruction rather than as a learning goal itself. From grades 3 to 6, music would be taught as a separate learning area, sharing a daily allocation of 40 minutes with Visual Arts and Physical Education. Later, the Department of Education, Culture, and Sports (DECS) issued further guidelines on the minimum learning requirement for music: identification of notation symbols and execution of simple forms and simple tonic-dominant-subdominant harmonies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the high school level, the teaching of music received new impetus with the 1986 Philippine Constitution provision which guaranteed free high school education. As a result, the DECS upgraded and revised the secondary school curriculum. Thus, with the creation of the Secondary Education Development Program (SEDP), the teaching of music in the high school system was institutionalized. Music was made part of a composite subject called PHEM, together with Health and Physical Education. PHEM received a daily 40-minute allocation throughout the four-year high school course. The fundamental learning framework was based on theoretical skills drawn from Western music. On their third year, students were taught Philippine and Asian music. The content of the Philippine music component included the indigenous music of northern Luzon, Islamic music of Mindanao, rural Christian folk music from the Tagalog and Visayan regions, and Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/768\">art songs</a> and old theater forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In both elementary and high school programs, singing constituted the main classroom activity. Some schools offered elective participation in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/801\">choruses</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/803\">rondalla</a><i> </i>groups, or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">bands</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Legislations for Music Education Basic Education.</b> The first legislation which touched on music education was Republic Act (RA) 4723 signed in 1966. It was known as the Music Law, which mandated the teaching of music and art as a separate subject in the elementary level and the teaching of music once a week in the secondary level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Governance of Basic Education Act or RA No. 9155 signed in 2001 led to the Basic Education Curriculum for Formal Education of 2002 which aimed, among other things, to develop in the Filipino learner a love of country and pride in his or her rich cultural heritage through holistic teaching and learning. The four components directed toward this aim were Musika, Sining, Edukasyong Pangkatawan, and Edukasyong Pangkalusugan (MSEPP). The experiential approach in listening, singing, playing, reading, and creating music became the preferred strategy for teaching music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Enhanced Basic Education Act or RA 10533 signed in 2013 is also known as the K-12 Program. It aims to prepare the Filipino learner for college or vocational-technical career opportunities to achieve global competitiveness within 12 years (six years in elementary, four years in junior high school, and two years in senior high school). This learner-oriented reform advocates the Mother-Tongue-Based Lingual Education for grades 1-3 and a specialized senior high school curriculum created with the cooperation of the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). The implementation of the K-12 program began in 2016. Under it, music is to be taught as a separate subject, with content and processes appropriate for each grade level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Presidential Decree No. 1287, signed in 1978, created the Philippine High School for the Arts (PHSA) in Makiling. It was instituted to search for and develop highly talented children exceptionally gifted in the arts, with the end goal of providing a continuing source of artists of excellence and leaders in the preservation and promotion of the Filipino&rsquo;s artistic heritage. Currently, the school has five specializations: creative writing, dance (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a>), music, theater arts, and visual arts. The PHSA curriculum is currently undergoing synchronization with the K-12 program to further support the development of artistry and creative expression in the specialized fields. The Special Program for the Arts (SPA) in the approved DepEd public high schools was conceived as a regional counterpart of PHSA but only in selected applicable fields. More initiatives from the regions would disseminate the SPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:distribute-all-lines\"><b>Higher Education. </b>The University of the Philippines (UP) Conservatory of Music was opened in 1916 by a Philippine Legislature Act. Since then, it has had 14 directors/deans. Originally modeled after European conservatories, it has since been elevated to a college in 1966, complementing its music offering with a substantive component of general education courses in the sciences, humanities, languages, and social sciences. Two faculty members (one from the Voice Department and one from Composition Department), and seven alumni (six from the Composition Department and one from the Voice Department) have been declared National Artists for Music.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today, the UP College of Music offers undergraduate and graduate programs which reflect a fusion of European conservatory and American college practices. It has eight departments: Composition, Conducting and Choral Ensemble, Music Education, Musicology, Keyboard, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/772\">Chamber Music</a>, Voice and Music Theater, and Winds and Percussion. In the ladderized undergraduate curriculum, a five-year bachelor of music program (BM) offers majors in instruments, conducting (band, choral, orchestral), piano, voice, dance, composition, music education, and musicology. The four-year diploma in the creative and performing musical arts (DCPMA) has majors in instrument, piano, band conducting, choral conducting, voice, dance, Asian music, composition, and music education. A short three-year music certificate program was created primarily for the performing arts, focusing on instruments and voice. At the graduate level, the college confers master of music degrees with majors in instruments, voice, musicology, conducting, and composition, which have been designed to deepen the respective BM areas of specializations. The 2011 Doctor of Philosophy in music aims to address the current demand for broader, more holistic, and more integrative activities in the dimensions of music scholarship, creation, and pedagogy in the country and in Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The University of Santo Tomas (UST) was founded in 1611 as a joint enterprise of Archbishop Miguel de Benavides and the Dominican order. The Conservatory of Music was founded much later in 1946, with Manuel de Cuerva as its first director and Rev Gregorio Garcia OP as regent. The current bachelor of music curriculum at UST is a four-year course with majors in keyboard, music education, voice, strings, guitar, woodwinds, brasswinds, percussion, music literature music theory, composition, conducting, musical theatre, and music technology. A three-year course with majors in keyboard, voice, strings, winds, percussion, and theory leads to a music teacher&rsquo;s certificate. In the field of performance, two types of courses are offered: a four-year performance certificate designed for students with a pronounced performance ability and a five-year artist diploma course designed for student with exceptional performance ability. Specialized courses in sacred music are also offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saint Scholastica&rsquo;s College (SSC) was founded by the Benedictine nuns in 1906. Music instruction was given by Sr Winfrieda Muller and in 1907 by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3901\">Sr Baptista Battig</a>, an accomplished pianist. The school became noted for excellence in piano performance. It produced its first piano graduate, Patrocinio Garcia, in 1917, and in that same decade, 11 others finished a piano course. The SSC Music Department continues to be one of the leading music schools in the Metro Manila area. Its current undergraduate curriculum consists of bachelor of music degrees in music composition (BMC); in performance (BMP) (voice, instruments, and violin pedagogy); music education (BMME); and a bachelor of arts in music production and technology (BAMPT). The college also offers diplomas in composition (DMC), performance (DMP), music production and technology (DMPT), and a certificate in music performance (CMP). The master of music has concentrations in music education, piano pedagogy, and string pedagogy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The School of Music of the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University offers a bachelor of music curriculum specializing in music performance, music education, Philippine music, and popular music, while for its master&rsquo;s degree, the specializations are music performance, music education, piano pedagogy, and ethnomusicology. The master of arts degree has three major areas of concentration: music education with emphasis on choral conducting, music education with emphasis on the Kodaly Approach, and ethnomusicology.

Its School of Music, which was granted college status in 2001, is officially known today as the College of Performing and Visual Arts. It confers bachelor of music degrees in choral conducting, composition and arranging, music education, piano, and voice as well as master of music degrees in choral conducting, instrument conducting, ethnomusicology, and music education. It initiated a research program on southern Philippine music and maintains an archive of taped music collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The University of San Agustin, originally Colegio de San Agustin, established in 1904 by missionaries belonging to the order of Saint Augustine, was granted university status in 1953. Its Conservatory of Music was subsequently established in 1967. The bachelor of music curriculum specifies the following areas of concentration: piano, voice, music science, and music education. An associate in music program and a music specialization course for elementary and secondary teachers are also offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1930s, two private music schools were established in Manila: the Academy of Music, founded in 1930, under the directorship of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4044\">Alexander Lippay</a>; and the Manila Conservatory of Music, founded in 1934, under the directorship of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3942\">Rodolfo S. Cornejo</a>. Both schools, however, only operated for a few years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Asian Institute for Liturgy and Music (AILM) is patterned after the German schools that specialize in church music. At AILM, the emphasis is on the use and development of traditional music in Asia for contemporary Christian liturgy and worship.Students follow a curriculum which includes theory, solfeggio, history, field methods, field work, transcription, chorus, composition, and instrumental and vocal performance and pedagogy. Enrollees hail from all over the Philippines as well as from different Asian countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside the academe, there are today some tutors who give private lessons on vocal technique and interpretation. Others have established private institutions to answer the demand for training among musical performers and composers, especially in the different mass media. One such school is the Ryan Cayabyab Music Studio, founded in 1986 by composer-performer Ryan Cayabyab and his wife Emelina Punzalan. It offers courses on music theory, music composition, music arrangement, music and movement, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">jazz</a> improvisation, piano, guitar, and voice, the latter for both pop and classical vocal artists.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3972\"><strong> Corazon C.

Planting, harvesting, fishing, and hunting are likewise accompanied by musical activity. In the chanted <a href=\"/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, heroes are extolled, genealogies are traced, and moral lessons are imparted. By and large, such music is learned by imitation and immersion. Young children who are surrounded by this music in their daily activities subconsciously absorb the repertoire. This unstructured transmission process takes place continuously in the community, from generation to generation."

His grandfather had two sons, Inagla and Lumunay, both epic singers. Lumunay was Inuk&#x2019;s father. Inuk&#x2019;s son Kagyo is also an accomplished singer. Since formal teaching is not part of the Manobo culture, the children of epic singers are more likely to become epic singers themselves through constant exposure. However, other interested youngsters with the &#x201C;proper voice&#x201D; may learn from a master in a very informal manner. Banlak and Mahunlayon, two Manobo epic singers, learned their songs by staying and listening to Inuk in his house for several nights.

It has eight departments: Composition, Conducting and Choral Ensemble, Music Education, Musicology, Keyboard, and <a href=\"/5/35/772\">Chamber Music</a>, Voice and Music Theater, and Winds and Percussion. In the ladderized undergraduate curriculum, a five-year bachelor of music program (BM) offers majors in instruments, conducting (band, choral, orchestral), piano, voice, dance, composition, music education, and musicology. The four-year diploma in the creative and performing musical arts (DCPMA) has majors in instrument, piano, band conducting, choral conducting, voice, dance, Asian music, composition, and music education. A short three-year music certificate program was created primarily for the performing arts, focusing on instruments and voice. At the graduate level, the college confers master of music degrees with majors in instruments, voice, musicology, conducting, and composition, which have been designed to deepen the respective BM areas of specializations. The 2011 Doctor of Philosophy in music aims to address the current demand for broader, more holistic, and more integrative activities in the dimensions of music scholarship, creation, and pedagogy in the country and in Southeast Asia."

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Music recordings refer to mechanically reproduced copies of musical performances, instrumental and/or vocal music. Such copies were originally known as records.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Records, technically called phonorecords, began with the invention of the phonograph cylinder in 1877 and the gramophone disc in 1881. The earliest records were sold in 1901 in the United States by Victor Company. By 1925, the speed of the record was standardized at 78 RPM (revolutions per minute). In 1948, Columbia introduced the 33 1&frasl;3 RPM vinyl LP (long-playing) record, and in 1949, the 45 RPM single was introduced by RCA-Victor. These analog discs were supplanted by digital compact discs (CDs) in 1981, co-developed by Phillips and Sony. All musical recordings contained in phonorecords, including those synchronized with film and games, are collectively called phonograms.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">According to Danny Yson, an American businessman named Isaac Beck opened a store in 1913 in Manila&rsquo;s Isaac Peral Street (later renamed United Nations Avenue), which sold 78 RPM discs from Victor Company and their disc player called the Victrola. In the same year, a retired US Army major named William Anderson took the initiative to record Filipino talents. Anderson, who was appointed representative of the Victor Talking Machine Company, created a makeshift studio on the second floor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> where he began recording songs from the Philippine <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a></strong>, the native adaptation of the Spanish zarzuela or lyric theater. Actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2818\">Maria Carpena</a> became the first Philippine recording artist. Accompanied by the Molina Orchestra, her song <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/943\">&ldquo;Ang Maya&rdquo;</a> (The Sparrow), composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\">Jose Estella</a> with lyrics by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>,<b> </b>was released by Victor Records in 1913.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, Isaac Beck became a distributor of Columbia Phonograph Company and became William Anderson&rsquo;s competitor. Beck put up his own radio station, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\">KZIB</a>, after the release by Columbia Records of two Filipino songs, &ldquo;Ang Dalagang Pilipina&rdquo; (Filipina Maiden) and &ldquo;Paalam sa Pagkadalaga&rdquo; (Farewell to Maidenhood), which were recorded by the mezzo-soprano Nati de Arellano in the United States. Ironically, by 1929, Arellano transferred to Victor Records and recorded extensively with them. Most notable of these recordings was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/956\">&ldquo;Mutya ng Pasig&rdquo;</a> (Muse of Pasig) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1920s, the popularity of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><i>bodabil</i></a> (the Filipino vaudeville) brought to the fore the eclectic talents of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a>, billed equally as &ldquo;Queen of Vaudeville&rdquo; and &ldquo;Queen of Jazz.&rdquo; She was the highest paid entertainer in the country during her prime and had popularized her trademark art of scat singing. By the 1930s, she would be most identified with the song <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/863\">&ldquo;Balut&rdquo;</a> (Duck Egg), a tune written by Jerry Brandy which was a bawdy take on the notorious Filipino culinary delicacy. However, her recorded legacy is the bilingual song <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/936\">&ldquo;Magtanim ay Di Biro&rdquo;</a> (Planting Rice Is Never Easy), recorded initially for Filipinos in the United States with the English title &ldquo;Planting Rice,&rdquo; which was released by RCA-Victor.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">Between the years 1927 and 1929, a young Filipino-Basque composer-pianist and conductor named Federico Elizalde, aka Fred Elizalde, did a series of jazz recordings in England for the prestigious Brunswick and Decca record labels. His recordings are considered milestones in the world of jazz, and are still available today under the name Fred Elizalde and his Anglo American Band. Elizalde was closely associated with modernist composers such as Maurice Ravel, Darius Milhaud, and Manuel De Falla. He returned to the Philippines in later years to conduct the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a> and attend to his family&rsquo;s media business.</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1930s, the most popular singer was Lilian Velez, who became a celebrated movie actress for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a>. She is best known for her on-screen rendition of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/992\">&ldquo;Sa Kabukiran&rdquo;</a> (By the Countryside), a theme song composed by her father <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4221\">Manuel P. Velez</a> for a film of the same title. The elder Velez wrote other timeless Philippine songs such as &ldquo;Lawiswis sa Kawayan&rdquo; (Swishing Bamboo), &ldquo;Ako&rsquo;y Kampupot&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m a Jasmine), and &ldquo;La Cari&ntilde;osa&rdquo; (The Affectionate Lady), which was recorded by the Victor Orchestra and released by Victor Records in 1930. The song &ldquo;Sa Kabukiran&rdquo; attained a wide Philippine cinematic following and was reinterpreted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4577\">Elsa Oria</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4668\">Sampaguita</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4668\"> Pictures</a>&rsquo; movie <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong>Bituing Marikit</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Beautiful Star) and by Nora Hermosa in Vista Films&rsquo; movie <b><i>Ang Siloy </i></b>(The Songbird).</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Songs from the Philippine sarsuwela found a new medium in movies and disc. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/872\">&ldquo;Bituing Marikit,&rdquo;</a> composed by Nicanor S. Abelardo in 1926, became a movie theme and title in 1937 for Sampaguita Pictures. Nicanor S. Abelardo supposedly recorded 16 of his songs for Victor Company, interpreted by various singers such as Nati de Arellano, Pacita de Tavera, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2763\">Florentino Ballecer</a>. The most significant of these recordings was &ldquo;Amorosa&rdquo; (The Amorous Lady), released by Victor in New York in 1922.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4875\">Sylvia La Torre</a>, known as the &ldquo;Queen of Kundiman,&rdquo; rose to prominence after World War II when she joined the roster of artists of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Manila Grand </a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Opera House</a>. In 1950, she became a recording artist for the fledgling independent label Bataan Records, with the song &ldquo;Si Petite Mon Amour&rdquo; (My Little Love). Later, she transferred to the larger independent <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\">Villar Records</a>, where she recorded her hit song <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1025\">&ldquo;Waray-Waray&rdquo;</a> (a person from Samar or Leyte), a blues progression with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> lyrics. Villar Records was launched in 1950 by the late Manuel P. Villar, known as the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Recording,&rdquo; who had released the first commercial record of the Philippine National Anthem. In the 1960s, Villar Records&rsquo; previous success with &ldquo;Waray-Waray&rdquo; paved the way for another Tagalog vernacular song with a rock and roll progression, &ldquo;Hahabol-habol&rdquo; (Chasing After) by Bobby Gonzales, a singer who became a star on the live musical stage of Manila&rsquo;s Clover Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1960s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\">Pilita Corrales</a>, a Cebuana Spanish mestiza, made a hit record in Melbourne titled &ldquo;Come Closer to Me&rdquo; and recorded three LPs for Australia&rsquo;s Astor Records. Her weekly television show from 1965-72 featured her international hit song &ldquo;A Million Thanks to You,&rdquo; composed by Alice Doria-Gamilla and released by Villar Records. She was dubbed &ldquo;Asia&rsquo;s Queen of Song&rdquo; and sang to open the Beatles&rsquo; 1966 concert at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Later on, she transferred to Vicor Music Corporation<b>, </b>a company founded by<b> </b>record industry entrepreneurs<b> </b>Vic del Rosario<b> </b>and<b> </b>Orly Ilacad. Here, she interpreted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\">George Canseco</a>&rsquo;s early compositions such as &ldquo;Kapantay ay Langit&rdquo; (As High as the Sky) issued in the album <b><i>Philippine Love Songs Vol. 1</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1970, a Filipino-American singer-drummer named Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith was discovered during his stint in Tokyo and was invited to join a band named Speed, Glue &amp; Shinki that subsequently released two albums: <b><i>Eve</i></b>, 1971, and their eponymous second album, 1972, under Atlantic Records. Prior to his Japanese experience, Smith, with his previous band the Downbeats, was also part of the opening act of the Beatles&rsquo; 1966 concert at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. Returning to Manila upon completing his obligations with Atlantic Records, he reinvented himself as Pepe Smith and, consequently, with his colleagues in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4025\">Juan de la Cruz Band</a>, invented Pinoy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a>. Released by Vicor Music, their comprehensive discography consisted of &ldquo;Up in Arms,&rdquo; &ldquo;Maskara&rdquo; (Mask), &ldquo;Super Session,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kahit Anong Mangyari&rdquo; (Whatever Happens). Pepe Smith&rsquo;s composition, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/901\">&ldquo;Ang Himig Natin&rdquo;</a> (Our Hymn), defined the character of Pinoy rock for an entire generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The avalanche of possibilities in Pinoy rock was multifaceted. In 1977, a rock vocalist named Tessie Alfonso, with stage name <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4161\">Sampaguita</a>, collaborated with an Olongapo-based guitarist, Gary Perez, to write songs for a self-titled LP released by Vicor that combined rock and roll with Tagalog street jargon, as in her single, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/873\">&ldquo;Bonggahan&rdquo;</a> (Revelry). After a long sabbatical, she repeated this formula on her own in 1991 with her single &ldquo;Nosi Ba Lasi&rdquo; (Tagalog word play for &ldquo;Sino Ba Sila?&rdquo;/Who Are They?), released on cassette tape by RJ Records. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4020\">Ramon Jacinto</a>, a rock and roll guitarist, singer, and businessman who owned RJ Records and the Rajah Broadcasting Network (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4822\">DZRJ</a>), had also released his own chart-topping song titled &ldquo;Muli&rdquo; (Once More) in the 1980s. A DZRJ favorite, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3988\">Florante</a>,<b> </b>recorded an album in 1978 titled <b><i>Mga Tula at <strong>Awit</strong>in ni Florante</i></b> (Poems and Songs of Florante) for an independent record label called Jem Recording Company<b> </b>that was received favorably by critics and folk-rock enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1976, Jem Recording Company, or simply Jem Records (not to be confused with an American label of the same name), introduced itself to the record-buying public with two prestigious LP album projects&mdash;namely, <b><i>Pinoy Jazz</i></b> by Eddie Munji III and <b><i>Pinoy Jazz II: Roots to Routes</i></b> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>. Both featured modern arrangements of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\">folk songs</a>. Amid a flurry of mixed reviews, the tracks from the two albums were continually rotated on AM and FM radio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The new Pinoy jazz genre was quickly supported by Vicor Records and its new subsidiary, Blackgold Records. Two groundbreaking albums by the Filipino bossa nova advocate and composer-pianist Bong Pe&ntilde;era found their place in the pop charts: <b><i>A Samba Song</i></b>, 1976, and <b><i>Batucada sa Calesa</i></b> (Batucada by the Horse-drawn Cart), 1977. It was also in 1977 that the LP <b><i>The Jazz Friends </i></b>was released. It<b> </b>featured Filipino big band performances with saxophonists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\">Lito Molina</a> and Doming Valdez, drummer Tony Velarde, and Manila&rsquo;s finest jazz musicians, accompanied by music created by the &ldquo;Godfather of Pinoy Jazz,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4117\">Angel Pe&ntilde;a</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In an unexpected move, Jem Records issued <b><i>Buhay Musikero</i></b> (Musician&rsquo;s Life), 1976, the first of three Pinoy Rock LPs that propelled <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\">Mike Hanopol</a>, the erstwhile singer-composer-bassist of the Juan de la Cruz Band, to the top of the local charts. Hanopol&rsquo;s themes of hardship, delinquency, greed, and desperation, combined with a refined rock aesthetic, were warmly received. This album was followed by two other LPs released by Blackgold Records&mdash;<b><i>Awiting Pilipino</i></b> (Filipino Songs), 1977, and <b><i>Buksan </i></b>(Open), 1978. Completing the cycle of classic Pinoy rock recordings, the abortive 1973 sessions of a Juan de la Cruz splinter group, Anak Bayan, were eventually released in 1977 in a self-titled LP by A&amp;W Records, a subsidiary of Villar Records. The singles &ldquo;Jeepney Rock&rdquo; and &ldquo;Probinsiyana&rdquo; (Country Girl) resonated with elements of rock and jazz undertones. Almost as an afterthought, an album by an Olongapo-based band named Maria Cafra, led by guitarist Resty Fabunan<b>, </b>was<b> </b>released in 1978 by Jem Records. The subgenre of music, described as <b>kundiman rock</b>, was both tentative and creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early to mid-1970s, Vicor Music Corporation and Villar Records were in competition to capture a burgeoning Filipino pop market. Vicor was first in line to heed the demand as Filipino language adaptations of Western songs were crafted. A song by Barbra Streisand, &ldquo;The Way We Were,&rdquo; was sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4134\">Rico J. Puno</a><b> </b>in an adaptation titled &ldquo;Alaala sa Luneta&rdquo; (Memories at Luneta), 1973. A song by the Bee Gees, &ldquo;Charade,&rdquo; was adapted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\">Willy Cruz</a><b> </b>into &ldquo;Tag-Araw&rdquo; (Summer), 1974, sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3863\">Hajji Alejandro</a>. The standard song &ldquo;There Will Never Be Another You&rdquo; was translated into &ldquo;Ikaw Pa Rin&rdquo; (Still You), 1975, by Tito Mina. Villar Records followed suit in 1974 with the release of the LP <b><i>Unang Kagat</i></b> (First Bite) and the single, &ldquo;Ikaw ang Miss Universe ng Buhay Ko&rdquo; (You are the Miss Universe of My Life), recorded by the pop-rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\">Hotdog</a>. The popularity of the Miss Universe ditty spawned the movie <b><i>Hotdog: Unang Kagat</i></b> in 1975, starring the band, with some of the biggest names in local cinema&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr,</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4264\">Boots Anson</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4264\"> Roa</a>&mdash;in cameo roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Initially described as <b>Manila Sound</b>, the genre later called <b>Original Pilipino Music</b> (OPM) underwent a gradual process of reinvention. Sunshine Records, a sub-label of Vicor Music, assembled a studio band named Cinderella featuring Yolly Samson that released three significant albums. The first LP, <b><i>Ang Boyfriend Kong Baduy</i></b> (My Gaudy Boyfriend), 1974, was a collection of novelty songs and a soft style marketed as the <b>Marshmallow Sound</b>. The song spawned a movie of the same title, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4462\">Jose Gosiengfiao</a>. Their second LP, <b><i>Cinderella 2</i></b>, 1975, featured a song composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3950\">Ernani Cuenco</a> titled &ldquo;Bato sa Buhangin&rdquo; (Pebble in the Sand) that became an enduring Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballad</a> and which also led to a movie of the same title, directed by Pablo Santiago. A third LP, <b><i>T.L. Ako sa Yo</i></b> (I&rsquo;m Truly in Love with You), 1975, featuring a new singer, Cecile Colayco, returned the group to their novelty roots before it disbanded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the coming of the 1980s, the architects of OPM were gradually outgrowing the adaptive and novelty genres of the Manila Sound. Most notably, a popular cover group named Circus Band<b> </b>had<b> </b>ceased performing in Manila&rsquo;s nightspots, starting an exodus of its members into the recording industry. The first to go was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\">Basil Valdez</a><b> </b>who recorded for Blackgold Records, a subsidiary of Vicor Music, the single &ldquo;Ngayon at Kailanman&rdquo; (Now and Forever), 1977, a song by George Canseco<b> </b>loosely based on the Diana Ross song &ldquo;All of My Life.&rdquo; The Circus Band keyboardist, Boy Katindig, also released a well-received instrumental jazz album titled <b><i>Midnight Lady</i></b> for A&amp;W Records International, a subsidiary of Villar Records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By then, the media czar of the Marcos regime, Teodoro Valencia, had authored a memorandum instructing all radio stations to air three Filipino recordings each hour. He also co-organized the Metropolitan Popular Music Festival in 1978 to stimulate originality in the songwriting field. Winning the grand prize for the premier event was Ryan Cayabyab&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kay Ganda ng Ating Musika&rdquo; (How Beautiful is Our Music), interpreted by Hajji Alejandro<b> </b>of the Circus Band. Interestingly, one finalist of that contest who did not win was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3857\">Freddie Aguilar</a>, whose composition <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/850\">&ldquo;Anak&rdquo;</a> (Child), became the most famous Filipino song in the world. In the following year, another Circus Band alumnus, Ray-An Fuentes, won first place with the song &ldquo;Umagang Kay Ganda&rdquo; (Beautiful Morning).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Golden Age of OPM had begun, ushering in a fresh crop of artists who would define the character of the genre. Leading the throng were the APO (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>) Hiking Society, which began with a comedic spin in their first two LPs, <b><i>In Concert #$% *!?</i></b>, 1974, and <b><i>Collector&rsquo;s Item</i></b>, 1975, but later came up with a more mature repertoire of classic pop singles released by Jem Records, including &ldquo;Mahirap Magmahal ng Syota ng Iba&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Difficult to Love Someone Else&rsquo;s Girlfriend), 1976, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/984\">&ldquo;Pumapatak ang Ulan&rdquo;</a> (Rain Is Falling), 1978, and &ldquo;Lumang Tugtugin&rdquo; (Old Tune), 1978. In 1985, when the group was already simply known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\">APO Hiking Society</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4022\">Danny Javier</a>, one of its members,<b> </b>wrote a song titled &ldquo;Di na Natuto&rdquo; (You Never Learn) for Blackgold Records for a gifted young singer named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\">Gary Valenciano</a>. Valenciano&rsquo;s creativity as a composer and instrumentalist led to a series of LPs and singles for Universal Records, which culminated in the technically innovative album <b><i>Moving Thoughts</i></b>, 1988, that featured his original songs like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1278\">&ldquo;Sana Maulit Muli&rdquo;</a> (I Hope It Happens Again) and &ldquo;Di Bale na Lang&rdquo; (Never Mind). &ldquo;Sana Maulit Muli&rdquo; inspired a movie of the same title, directed by Mike Relon Makiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The convergence of musical recordings and film was best exemplified by the singer and actress <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\">Sharon Cuneta</a>, dubbed &ldquo;The Megastar,&rdquo; whose 40 albums, 53 movies, and 10 television shows were unprecedented. Encouraged by her executive producer Vic del Rosario and aided by songwriters like George Canseco, Willy Cruz,<b> </b>and<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4214\">Rey Valera</a>, Sharon Cuneta movies like <b><i>Dear Heart</i></b>, 1981, <b><i>P.S. I Love You</i></b>, 1981, <b><i>Bukas Luluhod Ang Mga Tala</i></b> (Tomorrow, the Stars Will Fall on their Knees), 1984, <b><i>Bituing Walang Ningning</i></b> (Star Without Sparkle), 1985, <b><i>Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas</i></b> (May It Never End), 1986, and <b><i>Maging Sino Ka Man</i></b> (Whoever You May Be), 1991, became indistinguishable from her soundtrack hits. Other musical artists took to the fashion, with stars like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4040\">Kuh Ledesma</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\">Martin Nievera</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\">Zsa Zsa Padilla</a> being given their own television shows and movies. Songs like &ldquo;Dito Ba&rdquo; (Is It Here?), 1980, by Kuh Ledesma, composed by George Canseco; &ldquo;Ikaw ang Lahat sa Akin&rdquo; (You Are Everything To Me), 1985, by Martin Nievera, composed by Cecile Azarcon-Picazo; and &ldquo;Ikaw Lamang&rdquo; (Only You), by Zsa Zsa Padilla, composed by Dodjie Simon, became household hits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1982, the greatest Filipino jazz pianist of his time, Bobby Enriquez, emerged in the American limelight. He performed and recorded with some of the most established masters of the idiom, including the legendary trumpetist Dizzy Gillespie who fondly called him the &ldquo;wild man from Mindanao.&rdquo; The monicker stuck because it captured Bobby Enriquez&rsquo;s unpredictable yet engrossing piano style. Crescendo Records<b>, </b>his record label in the United States, was distributed in the Philippines<b> </b>by<b> </b>Villar Records, and through the latter, his LPs <b><i>The Wild Man</i></b> and <b><i>The Wild Man Meets The Madman</i> </b>became very popular jazz records in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1986, a new wave band called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\">The Dawn</a><b> </b>released their first eponymous album and single, &ldquo;Enveloped Ideas,&rdquo; under OctoArts International<b>, </b>which<b> </b>created much enthusiasm in the Pinoy rock community. Many felt that the group could fill the void left by the Juan de la Cruz band. The Dawn&rsquo;s second album in 1988, <b><i>I Stand With You</i></b>, with the single, &ldquo;Love Will Set Us Free,&rdquo; propelled the band to the top of the charts. Unfortunately, the untimely demise that year of its guitarist, Teddy Diaz, momentarily brought its rise to a standstill. After that, the band continued to release albums and remains active until today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Executive Order No. 255<i> </i>issued by Pres Corazon Aquino in 1987 stipulated that all local radio stations must air four or more OPM songs per hour. The karaoke sing-along device was also in vogue during this time, and helped propagate the OPM repertoire of songs far and wide. But the Golden Age of OPM reached a plateau towards the 1990s. The Philippine recording industry was in need of new blood. It was then that Francis Magalona, an actor and break-dancer in the 1980s ventured into the flourishing American genre called <b>rap</b>. Incorporating technique and social relevance, he emerged with records titled <b><i>Yo!</i></b>, 1990, which became the first commercially released Filipino rap album, and <b><i>Rap is Francis M</i></b>, 1992, both under PolyEast Records. His efforts at bringing nationalistic Filipino sensibilities to his field of artistic endeavor earned him a posthumous Presidential Medal of Merit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a parallel development, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\">Eraserheads</a><b>, </b>a<b> </b>band formed in 1991 by students from the University of the Philippines (UP), was rejected at every turn until BMG Records Pilipinas<b> </b>signed the group up for a three-year contract. Their debut record in 1993 called <b><i>Ultraelectromagneticpop</i></b> had sold 300,000 copies by the end of the year. The second album in 1994, <b><i>Circus</i></b>, sold 200,000 copies, and the third album in 1995, <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>, was certified Gold prior to release and went on to sell 400,000 copies. All seven albums and four compilation albums of Eraserheads sold out. The group&rsquo;s success is credited today for having opened the floodgates for <b>alternative music</b> in the Philippines. The character and flavor of alternative music encouraged independent recordings to prosper. The record companies, eager to emulate the success of the Eraserheads, signed dozens of nonmainstream acts like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4147\">Rivermaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\">Parokya ni Edgar</a>, Urbandub, Razorback, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4181\">Sponge Cola</a>.<b> </b>Independent commercial and institutional record labels also brought unexpected additions to a growing OPM tradition. Some of these independent labels such as Terno Recordings have created a large niche of their own in the music industry, featuring bands such as Up Dharma Down that released an album called <b><i>Fragmented</i> </b>in 2006 that merited a a full-page mention in <b><i>Time Magazine</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala</a>,<b> </b>a native of Davao City, with his group Ang Bagong Lumad, independently released <b><i>Panganay ng Umaga</i></b> (Eldest of the Morning) in 1981, a folk album utilizing native Filipino instruments such as the <b>hegalong </b>(two-stringed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">lute</a>), <b>kubing</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a>) and <b>kulintang</b><i> </i>(gongs of graduated sizes), released commercially by WEA Records in 1991. Ayala, with his sister, singer-songwriter Cynthia Alexander, independently recorded and released an album for the Asian puppet theater <b><i>Sita at Rama</i></b> (Sita and Rama), written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>. In New York, two albums of original works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4056\">Jose Maceda</a> were released by the Tzadik record label: <b><i>Gongs and Bamboos</i></b>, 2001, and <b><i>Drone and Melody</i></b>,<b> </b>2007. In 2012, <b><i>Humanfolk</i></b>, a<b> </b>collaboration between jazz<b> </b>guitarist-composer Johnny Alegre and the New York-based kulintang<i> </i>advocate and percussionist Susie Ibarra<b>, </b>augmented by<b> </b>the talents of Cynthia Alexander and the electronica exponent Malek Lopez, was recorded. Their album, which combined gongs, bamboo, and conventional instrumentation with computer programming, was released by MCA Music Philippines<b> </b>in 2011.<b> </b>Similarly, two albums that have received critical acclaim among peers are the experimental albums <b><i>Translating the Gongs</i></b>, 2006, and <b><i>Out of Tradition</i></b>, 2014, which were independently recorded and released by guitarist-composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3883\">Bob Aves</a> through his own record label, Tao Music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UP College of Music produced the records <b><i>Ang Musika ng mga Kalinga</i></b> (Kalinga Music), <b><i>Ang Mga Kulintang sa Mindanao at Sulu</i></b> (The Kulintang of Mindanao and Sulu), and <b><i>Kulintang and Kudyapiq</i></b>.

The earliest records were sold in 1901 in the United States by Victor Company. By 1925, the speed of the record was standardized at 78 RPM (revolutions per minute). In 1948, Columbia introduced the 33 1&#x2044;3 RPM vinyl LP (long-playing) record, and in 1949, the 45 RPM single was introduced by RCA-Victor. These analog discs were supplanted by digital compact discs (CDs) in 1981, co-developed by Phillips and Sony. All musical recordings contained in phonorecords, including those synchronized with film and games, are collectively called phonograms."

The Sociedad de Artes y Oficios was founded in 1869 to propagate the arts, including vocal and instrumental music. The Liceo Cientifico Artistico Literario was founded in 1877 and sponsored occasional literary and musical contests and concerts to serve music lovers and propagate literature and the fine arts. Only political ferment prevented its founders from putting up a conservatory. However, it did publish a journal, the <b><i>Revista del Liceo Cientifico Artistico y Literario de Manila</i></b> (Review of the Scientific, Artistic, and Literary Lyceum of Manila). The Sociedad Artistico Literaria de Iloilo was organized in 1893 to hold concerts and theatrical presentations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 16 Apr 1885, several musicians met at the Sampaloc residence of Pedro Gruet, upon the behest of Manuel Garrido and Carlos Saco del Valle, to set up Union Artistico Musical. The other musicians included Francisco Domingo and his orchestra director Joaquin Aragon, Eulogio Revilla and his director Florencio Lerma, Bruno Santa Maria and his director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3854\">Marcelo Adonay</a>, and Carlos Saco del Valle. The league aimed to protect music teachers and cultivate music and art. The Sociedad Musical Filipina de Santa Cecilia was founded in 1888 to improve the quality of music and protect musicians. In November 1891, Marques de Ahumada and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4152\">Francisco Roxas</a> were elected president and vice-president, respectively. The society presented programs and concerts. The Circulo Musical was founded in 1893 by Cipriano Gonzales in Pandacan to encourage the study of vocal culture and stringed instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sometime in 1902, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a> founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2973\">Gran Compa&ntilde;ia de la Zarzuela Tagala</a> which featured his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a><b> </b>productions in the first decade of the 20th century.

Ilagan&rsquo;s company had its own roster of actors and actresses, performing in Laguna, Bulacan, Bataan, Tayabas and other regions of Luzon. It presented sarsuwela such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a> </i></b>(Country Maiden),<b><i> Lucha Electoral </i></b>(Electoral Contest) and<b><i> Ilaw ng Katotohanan </i></b>(Light of Truth). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a> composed the music for <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b> and other Ilagan sarsuwela.

On 8 Jun 1901, the Centro Artistico was born. It held conferences, contests, concerts, and classes in solfeggio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violin</a> and many other instruments, declamation, oratory, gymnastics, fencing, and drawing.

Its goals were to foster camaraderie among its members, operate a printing press, open a music store, run a music school, and present regular concerts. The Club Euterpe, named after the muse of instrumental music, was founded in June 1907 to hold periodic concerts. Its officers were Filomena Barreto, president; Nena Zamora, vice-president; Lucia Hernandez, secretary; and Amada Arguelles, treasurer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3877\">Asociacion Musical de Filipinas</a> was founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3991\">Jovita Fuentes</a>, Natividad Arellano, Victorina Lobregat, Adelina Gurrea, Bonifacio Abdon, Mamerto Roxas, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a> on 3 Aug 1919. It aimed to cultivate good music, extend financial help to needy musicians, feature local compositions in concerts, sponsor visiting performers, and encourage local composers.

It also awarded educational grants to finance violinist Jose Vallejo and sopranos Jovita Fuentes and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4193\">Luisa Tapales</a>, and pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4056\">Jose Maceda</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specialized music societies included the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4067\">Manila Chamber Music Society</a>, founded 1921, Choral Art Association, 1930, and the Philippine Society for Chamber Music, 1936. The Manila Chamber Music Society was founded by a string quartet: violinists Bonifacio Abdon and Francisco Avellana, violist Jose Carrion, and cellist Felipe Marin. Chamber groups organized later enlarged the society. The society uniquely functioned without officers and did not collect fees. It was founded to cultivate local music, hone musicians, foster cooperation among musicians, and help deserving artists. It premiered some yet-unheard works of Western composers such as Schubert on 15 May 1924, and engaged Jascha Heifetz, who performed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a> on 5 Apr 1927, and Toti del Monte, who gave a concert in 1931. It also staged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operas</a>. On 30 Aug 1936, Benito H. Lopez founded the Philippine Society for Chamber Music that sought to encourage <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/772\">chamber music</a> performance. The society regularly sponsored free concerts featuring both European and Philippine compositions.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The promotion of choral music was enhanced by the Choral Art Association founded by Pacita Nolasco in 1930. The association worked to develop public appreciation of choral music and the teaching of choral singing. It sponsored several concerts featuring Antonio J. Molina&rsquo;s choral works, such as the choral cycles, sung by the association&rsquo;s female chorus under the baton of the composer himself. The Pro Arte Trio was a chamber ensemble composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\">Ramon Tapales</a>, Regina Feldman, and Jeno von Takacs organized to honor Johannes Brahms on 15 Sep 1933.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As more and more talented composers and performers emerged, so did associations that sought to promote local compositions, expose local talents, foster camaraderie among musicians, protect their welfare, expose the public to Western music, engage foreign artists, and publish notable works. One such group was the National Federation of Music, organized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3942\">Rodolfo S. Cornejo</a> on 24 Sep 1933. The Manila Music Lovers&rsquo; Society Inc, formed in July 1935, was led by Molina, Alfredo Lozano, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>. It was the only society then that established sister societies in the provinces such as the Pe&ntilde;aranda Music Lovers Society under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3965\">Felipe Padilla de Leon</a>, and the Cabuyao Music Lovers&rsquo; Society under Ramon Batallones, both founded in 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Cultural Concerts Society held regular concerts featuring the country&rsquo;s noted musicians such as coloratura <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4078\">Mercedes Matias-Santiago</a> on 23 Dec 1935, pianist Caridad Jison-Cruz on 15 Jan 1936, violinist Ramon Tapales on 12 Feb 1936, as well as soprano Enya Gonzales, pianist Purificacion Papa, and violinist Rizalina Exconde. The Amihan Musical Society, founded in Jul 1927 by Julianita P. de Loyzaga, aimed to improve operatic or dramatic and chamber music. Among its consultants were Jovita Fuentes, Encarnacion Pilapil, and Maria Mota. In the Visayas, the Iloilo Musical Association was founded by Benito H. Lopez to encourage performances and to build a concert hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Society of Oriental Culture was founded on 25 Feb 1940 with the support of President Manuel L. Quezon. It aimed to enrich Philippine music, disseminate musico-literary broadcasts, and conduct research on Asian culture. It elected Eulogio Rodriguez, chair; Antonio J. Molina, secretary; and Alfredo Lozano, managing director. During World War II, the Camia Musical Society was organized. Its inaugural program at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3098\">Metropolitan Theater</a> on 12 Dec 1943 featured an all-Philippine program. Composed of members of Manila&rsquo;s elite, the society was headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5069\">Pedro Aunario</a>. After the war, more organizations reflected varied interests. They continued to sponsor performances but became more specialized. There were new organizations of composers, performers, music teachers, music critics, opera lovers, bands, choral groups, and scholarship foundations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The National Musical Council of the Philippines was founded on 25 Mar 1953 in answer to UNESCO&rsquo;s call for worldwide understanding of all artistic and literary heritages. The council specified the following objectives: to promote cooperation and understanding among artists, music organizations, and institutions in the Philippines; to revive and conserve Filipino folk music; to encourage musical congresses, festivals, concerts, and other activities; to bring music to the largest number of people; to catalogue, publish, and copy Filipino music; and to collaborate with UNESCO in developing music education. Tapales was elected chair of the executive board composed of Molina as vice-president for music creation; Federico Elizalde, vice-president for music promotion: Julio Esteban Anguita, vice-president for music profession; Candida Bautista, vice-president for music education; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\">Lucrecia R. Kasilag</a>, executive secretary; Trinidad Legarda, treasurer; and Alfredo Lozano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>, Juan Javier, Sr Edgaria, Sr Gunfrida Schneider, Sor Catalina Ledesma, Pilar Lardizabal, and Liwanag Cruz as members. The Council organized the first conference of the Regional Music Commission of Southeast Asia in 1955. It organized the symposium &ldquo;Musics of Asia&rdquo; in 1966 and hosted the 1975 Third Asian Composers League Conference Music Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4091\">Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines (MPFP)</a>, a brainchild of Fuentes, was created by the government on 18 Jun 1955. Tasked to promote good music, its Board of Trustees was composed of Fuentes, chair; Isabel Roces, vice-chair; Lucrecia R. Kasilag, secretary; Evelina Kalaw, treasurer; Ramon Tapales, liaison officer; and Liwanag Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2548\">Leonor Orosa-Goquingco</a>, and Felipe Padilla de Leon, members. During its almost two decades of existence, the MPFP sponsored operas, including<b><i> Noli Me Tangere </i></b>(Touch Me Not), band concerts and competitions, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a>, sarsuwela,<b> </b>and symphony concerts. It commissioned music works and gave out music scholarships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Oct 1955, Eliseo M. Pajaro founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4039\">League of Filipino Composers (LFC)</a> under the auspices of the Regional Music Commission of Southeast Asia. The organization brought together the country&rsquo;s leading composers. Its goals were to cultivate, promote, and propagate its members&rsquo; compositions. The LFC, subsidized by the Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP), sponsored the annual Philippine Music Festival featuring its members&rsquo; works. It also sponsored composer workshops and seminars, and annual competitions for young composers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some organizations specialized in promoting opera. The Manila Opera Company, founded in 1952, staged a dozen productions and invited Arrigo Pola, Luciano Pavarotti&rsquo;s mentor, to give a series of concerts. Its founding officers were Carmen Plana, president; Pacita Madrigal-Gonzalez, vice-president; Eduardo Visaya, secretary; Fe Claudio, treasurer; A.D. Prescilla, assistant treasurer; and Isabel Padua, Luis Ablaza, and P.E. Domingo, members. In 1969, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4106\">Opera Guild of the Philippines</a> was founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3861\">Dalisay Aldaba</a>, Chito Madrigal Vasquez, Eloisa Revilla, Letty Montelibano, Lee Dilworth Dibbie, and Josephine Nicholoff. Its productions of <b><i>Pagliacci </i></b>and<b><i> La Serva Padrona </i></b>featured an all-Filipino cast directed by Zeneida Amador, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4234\">Oscar C. Yatco</a> conducting the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a>. Inactive for a time until revived in 1991 by Imelda Cojuangco, it mounted Verdi&rsquo;s <b><i>Rigoletto </i></b>in 1992, featuring Italians Giorgio Lormi, Tosi Poleri, and Vincenzo Bello, as well as Filipinos <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4179\">Nomer Son</a>, Vicente Antiporda, Gamaliel Viray, Josie Bailen, Luz Galvez, and Edgardo Crisol, with Regalado Jose conducting the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\"> (PPO)</a>. The guild gives scholarships to young opera talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines was founded through the efforts of Sonny Rodriguez and Teodoro Valencia. It restaged <b><i><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\">Walang Sugat</a> </i></b>(No Wounds) and <b><i>Minda Mora </i></b>in 1971 and 1982, and the opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\">La Loba Negra</a> </i></b>(The Black She-wolf) in 1984. It also sponsored sarsuwela-writing contests and produced cassette tapes of <b><i><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The cause of band music was taken up by the Pambansang Samahan ng Mga Banda sa Pilipinas (PASAMBAP) under Felipe Padilla de Leon in 1953. The association worked to unite all bands promote good band music and elevate the standards of band playing. It sought to end the practice of <b>tambakan</b>,<i> </i>a competition for bands that lasted for days, testing the limits of the participants&rsquo; physical endurance. The association sponsored festivals, concerts, and contests, and set up the Academy for Band Musicians which gave free music lessons. The PASAMBAP inspired the formation of the Pilipino Bandmasters Association which built a music library and published a newsletter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4120\">Philippine Choral Society</a> was founded by Liwanag Cruz in 1951. The first professional choral group in the country, it paved the way for other choral groups. Dedicated to the study, performance, and propagation of choral music, it was inactive from 1960 to 1971 but bounced back to life on 21 Mar 1971 with a concert at the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1954, the students of the late <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3989\">Lucia Francisco</a>, professor emeritus of the University of the Philippines College of Music, founded the Lucia Francisco Music Circle to encourage and train gifted piano students. The organization grants scholarships to students between the ages of five and 12. To upgrade music education, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4126\">Philippine Society for Music Education (PSME)</a> was organized in 1972. Its officers included Luz Villanueva, Juan P. Ramos, Corazon Maceda, Lucrecia R. Kasilag, Ma. Luisa Navarro, Candida Bautista, Vicente Sales, Vilma Santiago-Felipe, and Crispina Garcia. PSME held symposia and seminars on mass media, legislation, business, and education. It also held lecture-demonstrations on various approaches to music education, particularly for elementary school children. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4128\">Piano Teachers Guild of the Philippines (PTGP)</a> was organized in 1973 under the auspices of the PSME to encourage and promote professional growth, foster goodwill among teachers, establish a board of accreditation of teachers to raise professional standards, form chapter guilds all over the country, and promote new compositions for the piano. In 1975, the guild passed a code of ethics for its members, which paved the way for accreditation of piano teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1960, musicians led by Bienvenido Panganiban of the University of Santo Tomas Conservatory of Music founded the local chapter of Jeunesses Musices of the Philippines (JMOP), which sought to expose young people to music. JMOP aimed to provide an environment conducive to the cultivation of musical taste and stimulation of musical activity. Also in the 1960s, Vicente Sales founded the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4115\">Pasaknungan Philippines</a> to train young violinists and build a reservoir of artistic talent. The organization originally catered to the children of Government Social Insurance System (GSIS) personnel. In 1970, however, it started accepting children of non-GSIS personnel, mainly from low-income families. Its membership once swelled to around 400. Today, it limits its trainees to 140, from ages six to 19. On Sundays, the children were taught solfeggio in the morning, and violin ensemble and orchestra performance in the afternoon. Since 1981, Pasaknungan Philippines has been funded by the Philippine National Oil Corporation and the CCP, and many of its musicians have gone on to become professional string players in the country&rsquo;s major symphony orchestras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The government created the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4095\">National Music Competition for Young Artists (NAMCYA)</a> in 1973 to help discover talent in choral singing, piano, chamber music, family ensemble, and indigenous music. The government declared 26 Nov to 2 Dec National Music Week for Young Artists. With financial help and venue grants from the CCP and support from other organizations, NAMCYA has been holding annual competitions at the district, provincial, regional, and finally, national levels. Contestants must perform foreign as well as local compositions. The NAMCYA has recognized many brilliant young artists, including pianists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3908\">Jaime Bolipata</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3874\">Rowena Arrieta</a>, singers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4218\">Jonathan Velasco</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3982\">Andion Fernandez</a>, and violinists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3975\">Joseph Esmilla</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3907\">Alfonso Bolipata</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Various societies handling administrative management, fund raising, and marketing are behind the success of such major orchestras as the PPO, Manila Symphony Orchestra (MSO), National Philharmonic Orchestra (NPO), and Manila Chamber Orchestra (MCO). The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4070\">Manila Symphony Society (MSS)</a> was founded in 1931, five years after the MSO was organized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4044\">Alexander Lippay</a>. The MSO was first supported by the Asociacion Musical de Filipinas. Then the MSS took over planning and projects, bringing MSO performances not only to the theaters but also to the communities and schools in far-flung provinces and schools. MSS paid for the salaries of MSO musicians and musical directors, bought instruments and scores, and invested in promotions. In 1978, the Manila Metropolitan Theater (MET), was reopened and it became the base of the MSO until 1989. Due to financial difficulties, the MSO cancelled its 1988-1989 concert season, and staged its last concert at the Metropolitan Theater in 1989. The orchestra hibernated for a decade, until it was revived by violinist and orchestral conductor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4063\">Basilio Manalo</a> in 2001. It became known as MSO II, and the directorship was later passed on to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4085\">Arturo Molina</a>. A major force in its revitalization was the Philippine Research for Developing Instrumental Soloists (PREDIS), founded in 1984 by Manalo, with the aid of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4131\">Sr Mary Placid</a> of Saint Scholastica&rsquo;s College, which eventually housed the MSO II from 2001 to 2014. PREDIS aims to develop young instrumentalists who will later supply the needs of the MSO and other orchestras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1960, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4150\">Redentor Romero</a> founded the NPO. That same year, Romero established the National Philharmonic Society (NPS) to support the cultural programs of the NPO. When the orchestra folded in 1984, the NPS continued to present regular seasons of performances featuring foreign as well as Filipino artists. It has sponsored outreach programs to the provinces and produced recordings of Philippine classics with the London, Royal, and Moscow Philharmonic Orchestras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The PPO is the only orchestra completely subsidized by the state, specifically, the CCP. It has conducted regular seasons at the CCP Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a> (formerly Main Theater) under the directorship of Oscar C. Yatco and other conductors. In 1985, the Philippine Philharmonic Society Inc (PPSI) was formed to extend additional help to PPO members. It launched the Orchestra Endowment Fund in 1987 to handle PPO funds raised through donations and other projects and augments CCP&rsquo;s allocation to the PPO. The PPSI was later renamed Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra Society, Inc. (PPOSI) in 1996, with the prime objective to promote, enhance and develop the premiere orchestra of the country, whose level of excellence can be comparable with its foreign counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike the PPO, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4068\">Manila Chamber Orchestra</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4068\"> (MCO)</a> was fully subsidized in the past by the privately-owned PCI Bank through the MCO Foundation, which later went public in 1990 and included corporate institutions such as the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co, Philips, Meralco, and IBM. Its annual concert season featured Filipino as well as foreign artists. It was being conducted by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\">Sergio Esmilla</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\"> Sr</a> until the orchestra&rsquo;s untimely dissolution in 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1991, pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4157\">Ingrid Sala-Santamaria</a> returned to Cebu and, in her capacity as the chair of the Salvador and Pilar Sala Foundation, started a Ten-Year Development Program for the young music talents of the city, with the intention of forming a youth orchestra of a national caliber. It resulted in the founding of the Cebu Youth Symphony Orchestra in 1995, which later became the Peace Philharmonic Philippines in 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Orchestral organizations founded in the 21st century include the Manila Philharmonic Orchestra, founded in 2003 and conducted by Rodel Colmenar, which is the only Filipino orchestra owned and managed by the musicians themselves; San Miguel Foundation Orchestra, founded in 2001 but disbanded in 2007; Metro Manila Community Orchestra, 2000, conducted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4197\">Chino Toledo</a>; FILharmoniKA, 2005, originally named Global Studio Orchestra or GC4, conducted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\">Gerard Salonga</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> Philharmonic Orchestra, 2012, also conducted by Gerard Salonga; and the Orchestra of the Filipino Youth, 2013, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3946\">Jovianney Emmanuel Cruz</a> as its artistic director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Friends of the CCP was founded in 1979 to attract a bigger audience for CCP events. Chito Madrigal was elected president and Lula Dawson vice-president. A heterogeneous group, Friends is composed of people of different nationalities and occupations. It disseminates information on art exhibits, performances, and other cultural events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music reviewing and criticism was pursued vigorously in the 1980s with the formation of the Music Critics Guild or Samahan ng Mga Manunuri at Manunulat sa Musika ng Pilipinas (SAMMPI) organized in 1983 by a group of music writers and reviewers led by Exequiel Molina. Officers and members were inducted by then-CCP president Lucrecia R. Kasilag. Founding members were Felipe de Leon Jr, Vilma Santiago-Felipe, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4009\">Antonio C. Hila</a>, Fe Mangahas, Pablo Tariman, Ana Leah Sarabia de Leon, and Felicidad Z. Reyes. The guild&rsquo;s goals were to promote music criticism, appreciation of foreign, Philippine, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">pop</a>, and serious or classical music, and train prospective music writers and critics. On the other hand, the interests of local composers, lyric writers, music publishers, and music copyright owners have been pursued by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3987\">Filipino Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers, Inc (FILSCAP)</a>, which was established in 1965 to administer the performing and reproduction rights of its local members based on copyright legislation, and also provide representation for foreign composers, lyricists, and music publishers if agreed upon by similarly constituted societies to which they belong.

It has since held workshops for promising music writers which were conducted by the organization&rsquo;s founding members, among them Odette Quesada, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4113\">Jim Paredes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4167\">Vehnee Saturno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4192\">Danny Tan</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3899https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3899\">Heber Bartolome</a>. Another group of composers, the Asian Composers League-Philippines (ACL-Philippines), whose membership is by invitation only, was founded in 2005, with the aim of supporting and fostering the development of contemporary music works of Filipino composers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Right after the EDSA Revolt of 1986, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines (CAP)</a>, the Alliance of Artists for the Creation of the Ministry of Culture (AACMC), and the Samahan sa Kultura at Sining (SAKSI) were formed to lobby for the creation of a ministry of culture to administer cultural affairs. In response, the Aquino government created the Presidential Commission for Culture and the Arts (PCCA) under Executive Order (EO) 118, dated 30 Jan 1987. This eventually became the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, by virtue of Republic Act (RA) 7356, passed on 8 Apr 1992. The NCCA was placed directly under the Office of the President solely for budgetary concerns. Its main task was to reconstruct the Filipino national identity by formulating cultural policies and coordinating the activities that promoted the culture of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Federation for Choral Music (PFCM), organized in 1996, was geared towards the promotion and appreciation of choral music. Part of its aim was to make choral music a potent force in the development of national culture. However, this organization did not last long. The Philippine Choral Directors Association (PCDA), with almost similar aims as the earlier PFCM, founded in 2008, continued the thrust of gathering choral conductors all over the Philippines. Since its foundation, the PCDA has been actively propagating Philippine choral arts through its annual conventions. In 2014, it hosted the meeting of its international counterpart, the International Federation for Choral Music (IFCM) in Ilocos Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Opera Company (POC), founded in 1999, is the only opera company in the country that regularly presents staged drama with music. It has produced operas, sarsuwela, and musicals for the contemporary theater audience. The POC has constructed its own Opera Haus, hailed as the permanent home for classical singers of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Musicological Society of the Philippines (MSP) was founded in 2002 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3918\">Jose Buenconsejo</a> and Maria Alexandra I&ntilde;igo-Chua, with the aim of advancing music scholarship in the country. Its incumbent president is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\">Ramon P. Santos</a>, who has held the position since 2004. The MSP has also hosted various musicological conferences and international music festivals. Moreover, members of the MSP have presented and published papers in related academic societies of the Philippines, notably the Philippine Studies Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the field of popularmusic, several organizations have been formed to promote the welfare of performers and composers. Foremost among these organizations is the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI), successor of the Recording Industry Association of the Philippines (RIAP) which was established in the mid-1960s. Since its inception in 1976, PARI has been active in the supervision of the conduct of the local recording business and the improvement of local record production. Its key responsibility, however, has been to protect legitimate record producers from unscrupulous duplicators or pirates. PARI has duly recognized 32 recording companies as members. Its past presidents include Antonio Lustre (elected 1976) and James Dy (elected 1978). In 1981, Danilo P. Olivares was elected as PARI&rsquo;s professional or lifetime president.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1986, singer <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4041\">Celeste Legaspi</a> spearheaded the Organisasyon ng Pilipinong Mang-aawit (OPM), a pioneering association that seriously pursues the proliferation and propagation of Filipino popular music, as well as the improvement, upliftment, and enhancement of the working conditions of both the performers and those directly involved in the singing field (e.g., talent managers, instrumentalists, production assistants, technical and lighting directors, press members). OPM has produced numerous concerts at major entertainment venues. It has also conducted talent development workshops and has granted scholarship awards to deserving new talents. OPM is currently headed by singer and comedienne <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4210\">Mitch Valdes</a>. She was preceded by Celeste Legaspi who served from 1986 to 1988, and composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4113\">Jim Paredes</a> who was elected in 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Jazz Society of the Philippines was launched on 16 Mar 2003, aimed as a venture for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">jazz</a> loving enthusiasts to get together to enjoy, advance and promote jazz music in the Philippines. Among its founders was the jazz historian, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4135\">Richie Quirino</a>.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Antonio C.

Only political ferment prevented its founders from putting up a conservatory. However, it did publish a journal, the <b><i>Revista del Liceo Cientifico Artistico y Literario de Manila</i></b> (Review of the Scientific, Artistic, and Literary Lyceum of Manila).

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Patronage refers to the support, encouragement, and financial aid that an agency or an individual grants to another individual or group. Music patronage may come as state, church, private, corporate, or institutional support for composers and musicians.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the Spaniards colonized the Philippine Islands in 1565 and under the system of the Patronato Real, Hispanic cultures were assimilated by the natives in a long process that lasted from the late 16th century to the end of the 19th century. The Catholic Church was the principal patron of music during this time, and it was also the best archivist of works and other colonial cultural productions of the period. European music, used principally as a tool for conversion to Christian beliefs and the promotion of the Spanish crown, dominated the people&rsquo;s choice for musical productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the opening of the Philippine ports in 1834 and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, new forms of cultural activities emerged in urban areas that were no longer entirely dominated by the Spanish church and state. A number of organizations made up of prominent citizens and <i>ilustrados</i> (educated) bonded to form what could be called an incipient &ldquo;civil society&rdquo; in the cities. Naturally, owing to their Spanish education, they had a very strong bias towards Western music and art. These organizations were Sociedad de Anonima, established in 1862, Sociedad de Artes y Oficios, 1869, Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario, 1877, Union Artistico Musical, 1885, Sociedad Musical Filipina de Santa Cecilia, 1888, Circulo Musical, 1893, and Sociedad Artistico-Literaria de Iloilo. These associations generally had for their aims one or more of the following: (1) to promote and cultivate all kinds of arts, (2) to maintain and protect the interests of the lovers of music, fine arts, and literature and cultivate aesthetic taste, (3) to protect the common interests of Filipino musicians, (4) to encourage musical education, especially the study of vocal and stringed instruments, and (5) to render literary and musical entertainments, theatrical presentations, and literary and musical contests. These societies sponsored art competitions, produced musical-literary concerts or <i>veladas,</i> and held private <i>tertulias</i> (soirees), which provided a space for music performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But even as private organizations sponsored the arts, the Spanish colonial state and church continued to support musical organizations. In the 19th century, the Spanish Regimental <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">Bands</a> gave weekly concerts at Binondo Plaza and later, at the Luneta. Orchestras were maintained by church authorities in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>. A number of Filipino musicians were trained in these prestigious state- and church-endowed organizations. It was this group of elite musicians who then passed on their musical skills and knowledge to less-privileged Filipinos who played in bands for fiestas, religious processions, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a> in the provinces. These cultural events were organized by the Comite de Festejos and supported by <i>hermanos y hermanas </i>mobilized by local priests and mayors during annual fiestas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The American occupation of the Philippines (1898-1940) established a far-reaching public system of education. The secular culture which began to assert itself in the late 19th century intensified in the American period. The American Insular Government sponsored musical groups, most prominent of which was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\">Philippine Constabulary Band</a>.

In effect, MPFP was the first government-funded organization that promoted the creation and performance of opera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><b>sarsuwela</b></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/798\">symphonic music</a>, and the creation through commissioning of major musical works. While the MPFP sponsored performances of western operas like <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> and <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b>, it did encourage the creation and performance of Filipino music. The MPFP mounted the premiere production and performance of Felipe de Leon&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong> </i></b>(Touch Me Not), 1957, and, later on, <b><i><strong><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></strong> </i></b>(Subversion), 1970.

Among the more far-reaching projects the organization started was the radio program <b><i>Musika ng Lahi</i></b> (Music of the Race) that featured music of Filipino composers.

By the 1970s, the Marcos regime, through the initiative of the then First Lady Imelda Marcos, the &ldquo;Patroness of the Arts,&rdquo; provided the needed support for some artists and musicians. After the opening of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> in 1969, the following were established as national companies under the CCP, with the necessary and much-needed state support: Philippine High School for the Arts, 1977, CCP Philharmonic Orchestra, 1973 (renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a> in 1982), CCP Dance Company, 1970 (renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Ballet Philippines</a> in 1981), UP Madrigal Singers, 1963 (later known as the Philippine Madrigal Singers), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a>, 1957, and Opera Company of the Philippines, 1983. The Young Artists Foundation of the Philippines was the arm of the Marcos regime that sent many talented young artists abroad to hone their craft under the best teachers and schools. Many of these musicians are now based abroad. Some of the more renowned scholar-musicians that received state support under YAFP were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3874\">Rowena Arrieta</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3908\">Jaime Bolipata</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3909\">Ramon Bolipata</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3946\">Jovianney Emmanuel Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3975\">Joseph Esmilla</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4043\">Cecile Licad</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After 1986, the CCP, under Ma. Teresa E. Roxas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a>, implemented a five-point thrust that reoriented the institution&rsquo;s previous elitist and colonial outlook into one that was decidedly Filipino, democratic, and decentralized, and was supportive of artistic excellence and the promotion of Filipino artists abroad. Instead of just a venue, CCP from 1986 onto the 1990s became a national coordinating center for arts activities throughout the country, thus providing more grants and support to many Filipino artists and arts groups outside of CCP. With CCP&rsquo;s encouragement, local arts councils were institutionalized, and there were vibrant arts and cultural exchanges between Manila and the provinces. CCP&rsquo;s Filipino Artists Series regularly featured notable Filipino musical artists performing classical, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">popular</a>, and alternative music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1990, Executive Order (EO) No 118 created the Presidential Commission on Culture and the Arts under President Cory Aquino. The EO was enacted into law in 1992 and, under Republic Act No. 7356, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> was established. In 1999, through EO No. 80, the CCP, Commission on Filipino Language, National Museum, National Historical Institute (now Commission), National Library, and Records Management and Archives Office, together with representatives from government bodies and cultural workers from the private sector, came together to compose the NCCA, the government entity that creates and coordinates national arts policy. The NCCA, through the subcommittees on the arts, cultural heritage, and cultural communities, and with funds from the National Endowment for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA), funded performances, competitions, researches, publications, and maintenance of cultural capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Private corporations also did their share for music patronage. When the Manila Symphony Orchestra, based at the Metropolitan Theatre in Liwasang Bonifacio beginning late 1970s, disbanded in 1989, the string section was absorbed by PCI Bank, which supported what became a fine string orchestra of the period&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4068\">Manila Chamber Orchestra</a> under conductor <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\">Sergio Esmilla</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3976\"> Jr.</a> This orchestra had concert seasons in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a> Hall until 1992. Between 2001 and 2007, San Miguel Corporation established and managed the San Miguel Foundation for the Performing Arts. Its cultural groups, the San Miguel Master Chorale and San Miguel Philharmonic Orchestra, were among the best performing groups of the time. During its short but productive existence, the SMFPA released several albums, gave member-musicians a much-needed financial boost, and hired one of the country&rsquo;s renowned musicians, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Cipriano &ldquo;Ryan&rdquo; Cayabyab</a>, as resident musical director as well as composer and arranger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, outside of formal institutional patronage, different forms of grassroots communities self-support the production of various types of music that are expressive of subcultural identities and are catalysts for group bonding and affinity. These communities feed on nonmainstream music such as indie, alternative, underground, rock, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/797\">sound art</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">jazz</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/778\">hip-hop</a>, that are heard in clubs like Conspiracy, a songwriters&rsquo; hub; My Bro&rsquo;s Mustache in Timog and Balete in Kamias for acoustic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>; Saguijo, Route 196, and 70s Bistro for rock; and Monk&rsquo;s Inn for jazz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this regard, choirs in local churches all over the Philippines share a similar position. Churches do not employ them and thus choirs can be considered private, voluntary associations. However, they are given a space in the church premises to rehearse their songs, and this is already a form of support. In exchange, choirs sing for the churches&rsquo; services. Lastly, nongovernment foundations are also a source of support for music. Some are attached to <b>music schools</b> like the PREDIS Chamber Orchestra program of Saint Scholastica&rsquo;s College, which trains young children in string music; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4128\">Piano Teachers Guild of the Philippines</a> made up of piano teachers from UP and UST who have organized piano recitals and competitions; and the Music Research Foundation (MUSARFOUND) of the UP College of Music, which provides tuition scholarship and funds for music research and creative works. Another foundation of note is the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\">Francisco Buencamino</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\"> Sr</a> Music Foundation, Inc, which has been supporting talented musicians. Cecile Licad, being a renowned member of the Buencamino clan, holds regular concerts in the Philippines to partially fund the scholars.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Raul C.

The Catholic Church was the principal patron of music during this time, and it was also the best archivist of works and other colonial cultural productions of the period. European music, used principally as a tool for conversion to Christian beliefs and the promotion of the Spanish crown, dominated the people&#x2019;s choice for musical productions."

				"value": "After the opening of the Philippine ports in 1834 and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, new forms of cultural activities emerged in urban areas that were no longer entirely dominated by the Spanish church and state. A number of organizations made up of prominent citizens and <i>ilustrados</i> (educated) bonded to form what could be called an incipient &#x201C;civil society&#x201D; in the cities. Naturally, owing to their Spanish education, they had a very strong bias towards Western music and art. These organizations were Sociedad de Anonima, established in 1862, Sociedad de Artes y Oficios, 1869, Liceo Cientifico Artistico-Literario, 1877, Union Artistico Musical, 1885, Sociedad Musical Filipina de Santa Cecilia, 1888, Circulo Musical, 1893, and Sociedad Artistico-Literaria de Iloilo. These associations generally had for their aims one or more of the following: (1) to promote and cultivate all kinds of arts, (2) to maintain and protect the interests of the lovers of music, fine arts, and literature and cultivate aesthetic taste, (3) to protect the common interests of Filipino musicians, (4) to encourage musical education, especially the study of vocal and stringed instruments, and (5) to render literary and musical entertainments, theatrical presentations, and literary and musical contests. These societies sponsored art competitions, produced musical-literary concerts or <i>veladas,</i> and held private <i>tertulias</i> (soirees), which provided a space for music performances."

In the 19th century, the Spanish Regimental <a href=\"/5/36/800\">Bands</a> gave weekly concerts at Binondo Plaza and later, at the Luneta. Orchestras were maintained by church authorities in the <a href=\"/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> and the <a href=\"/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a> in <a href=\"/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>. A number of Filipino musicians were trained in these prestigious state- and church-endowed organizations. It was this group of elite musicians who then passed on their musical skills and knowledge to less-privileged Filipinos who played in bands for fiestas, religious processions, and <a href=\"/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a> in the provinces. These cultural events were organized by the Comite de Festejos and supported by <i>hermanos y hermanas </i>mobilized by local priests and mayors during annual fiestas."

With CCP&#x2019;s encouragement, local arts councils were institutionalized, and there were vibrant arts and cultural exchanges between Manila and the provinces. CCP&#x2019;s Filipino Artists Series regularly featured notable Filipino musical artists performing classical, <a href=\"/5/35/790\">popular</a>, and alternative music."

In 1999, through EO No. 80, the CCP, Commission on Filipino Language, National Museum, National Historical Institute (now Commission), National Library, and Records Management and Archives Office, together with representatives from government bodies and cultural workers from the private sector, came together to compose the NCCA, the government entity that creates and coordinates national arts policy. The NCCA, through the subcommittees on the arts, cultural heritage, and cultural communities, and with funds from the National Endowment for Culture and the Arts (NEFCA), funded performances, competitions, researches, publications, and maintenance of cultural capital."

When the Manila Symphony Orchestra, based at the Metropolitan Theatre in Liwasang Bonifacio beginning late 1970s, disbanded in 1989, the string section was absorbed by PCI Bank, which supported what became a fine string orchestra of the period&#x2014;the <a href=\"/5/42/4068\">Manila Chamber Orchestra</a> under conductor <a href=\"/5/42/3976\">Sergio Esmilla</a><a href=\"/5/42/3976\"> Jr.</a> This orchestra had concert seasons in <a href=\"/5/42/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a> Hall until 1992. Between 2001 and 2007, San Miguel Corporation established and managed the San Miguel Foundation for the Performing Arts. Its cultural groups, the San Miguel Master Chorale and San Miguel Philharmonic Orchestra, were among the best performing groups of the time. During its short but productive existence, the SMFPA released several albums, gave member-musicians a much-needed financial boost, and hired one of the country&#x2019;s renowned musicians, <a href=\"/5/5/3933\">Cipriano &#x201C;Ryan&#x201D; Cayabyab</a>, as resident musical director as well as composer and arranger."

Churches do not employ them and thus choirs can be considered private, voluntary associations. However, they are given a space in the church premises to rehearse their songs, and this is already a form of support. In exchange, choirs sing for the churches&#x2019; services. Lastly, nongovernment foundations are also a source of support for music. Some are attached to <b>music schools</b> like the PREDIS Chamber Orchestra program of Saint Scholastica&#x2019;s College, which trains young children in string music; the <a href=\"/5/5/4128\">Piano Teachers Guild of the Philippines</a> made up of piano teachers from UP and UST who have organized piano recitals and competitions; and the Music Research Foundation (MUSARFOUND) of the UP College of Music, which provides tuition scholarship and funds for music research and creative works. Another foundation of note is the <a href=\"/5/42/3917\">Francisco Buencamino</a><a href=\"/5/42/3917\"> Sr</a> Music Foundation, Inc, which has been supporting talented musicians.

As a scholarly discipline in the university, musicology did not exist in the Philippines before 1950, although inquiries into the subject of Philippine music had begun much earlier, as seen in the works of intellectuals like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3924\">Fernando Canon</a>, Epifanio de los Santos, Raymundo Ba&ntilde;as, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3225\">Norberto Romualdez</a>, and Alfredo Roa. There is much material prior to 1950 which may not be technically &ldquo;musicological&rdquo; or &ldquo;ethnomusicological&rdquo; but is of great value to the music scholar and historian. The material includes accounts in journals, magazines, newspapers, monographs, books, and related studies written mostly by anthropologists, linguists, folklorists, and cultural historians. Information can also be gleaned from the writings of early explorers, travelers, missionaries, and civil servants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"spanish\" name=\"spanish\"></a>The Spanish Colonial Period (1500-1900)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The principal sources of information on music of this period are the historical chronicles and travelogues by Spanish friars or government officials.

Subsequent chronicles of the Franciscan mission, like the <b><i>Estatutos y Ordenaciones </i></b>(Statutes and Decrees), 1732, and <b><i>Chronicas </i></b>(Chronicles) 1738, 1741, and 1744, mention the beneficial results of the 1573 mandate to establish schools for boys in towns. Detailed descriptions of the Franciscan schools enumerate the functions and duties of singers and single out the efforts of Frs Geronymo Aguilar, Pedro Bautista, and Juan de Santa Marta. The latter headed a school of 400 boys in Lumbang, Laguna. Jesuits Fr Pedro Chirino&rsquo;s <b><i>Relacion de las Islas Filipinas </i></b>(Account of the Philippine Islands), 1604, and Fr Pedro Murillo Velarde&rsquo;s <b><i>Historia de la Provincia de Philipinas de la Compania de Jesus </i></b>(History of the Province of the Philippines of the Society of Jesus), 1749, and <b><i>Geographica Historia de las Islas Philipinas </i></b>(Geographic History of the Philippine Islands), 1752, carry descriptions of indigenous music&mdash;drums and bells used during sacrificial rituals, bells in important announcements and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a> containing genealogies, and musical instruments like the <b>cutyapi</b><i> </i>or <b>coryapi</b>, <b>bangsi</b>,<b> nose flute</b>, <b>harpa</b>,<b> rabel</b>,<b> </b>and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\"><b>guitarra</b></a> in burial and wake ceremonies, as well as Western music as embodied in the choirs, the organ-playing during mass, the church celebrations during feasts, and the abundance of violinists, flutists, and oboists in towns.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Francisco Combes&rsquo;s <b><i>Historia de Mindanao e Jolo </i></b>(History of Mindanao and Jolo), 1667, and William Dampier&rsquo;s <b><i>A New Voyage Round the World</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1729, describe native instruments like the <b>agun</b>, <b>guimbao</b>, <b>kulintangan</b> and their uses during ceremonies. Dr John Francis Careri&rsquo;s <b><i>A Voyage Round the World</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1732, describe responsorial singing of successive stanzas of a song to the accompaniment of a metal drum, the practice of sounding drums and other instruments during an eclipse to fight away the dragon who swallows the moon, and shamans called <i>catalonan </i>among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> and <i>babaylan </i>among the Visayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Juan de la Concepcion wrote in <b><i>Historia General de las Islas Filipinas </i></b>(General History of the Philippine Islands), 1788-1792, of the Filipino&rsquo;s ease and facility in playing instruments. The remark was echoed by many other writers such as Franciscan Juan de Medina, who wrote in 1630 that there were very good singers in Manila, and Fray Francisco de Santa Ines, who wrote in 1676 that there were types of music in the Philippines that could rival those of the cathedrals in Spain.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Around 1750, Fray Juan J. Delgado mentioned Palawan indigenous music accompanied by dancing and singing, improvised responsorial singing called <b>cauitaan</b><i> </i>and <b>siray</b>,<b> </b>music used in rites for the sick and the dead, and various types of wood used in making instruments. After 1750, much more published material&mdash;compilations of historical documents by religious, military, and civil servants, and a growing number of travelogues&mdash;described local musical practices. Captain Thomas Forrest&rsquo;s <b><i>A Voyage to New Guinea and the Moluccas</i></b>, 1779, mentioned gongs with knobs from Java called <b>kallintang</b>, as well as gongs without knobs from China. He included the text, with translation, of a leader-chorus type of rowing song called &ldquo;Maguindanao Mangaio.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fr Joaquin Martinez de Zu&ntilde;iga&rsquo;s <b><i>Mis Viajes por este Pais en 1800 </i></b>(My Voyages in this Country in 1800), 1893, contained descriptions of songs, dances, and literary works of Lipa, Batangas, and church choirs in Manila singing &ldquo;Kyrie,&rdquo; &ldquo;Credo,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gloria.&rdquo; He also described Filipinos as fast learners in any art form. Furthermore, Fr Martinez described the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><b>kundiman</b></a> as a song-dance genre&mdash;it only became a &ldquo;mere&rdquo; song about love in the late 19th-early 20th century. Kundiman as a song-dance genre was confirmed in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3633\">Jose Honorato Lozano</a>&rsquo;s drawing, supplemented by prose description and transcription, which appeared in Gervasio Gironella&rsquo;s illuminated manuscript titled <b><i>Album: Vistas de las Yslas Filipinas y Trages de sus Abitantes </i></b>(Album: Views of the Philippine Islands and the Clothing of their Inhabitants), 1847.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his account of a <b><i>Voyage to Peking and Manila Between the Years 1784-1801</i></b>,<i> </i>M. de Guignes described balls in Manila where fandango, bolero, and minuet were danced. Young ladies in Manila, he wrote, also sang and played the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a>. Adolfo Puya Ruiz also noted in <b><i>Filipinas: Descripcion General de la Provincia de Bulacan </i></b>(Philippines: General Description of the Province of Bulacan), 1838, that most women knew how to play the piano, harp, <b>bajo</b> or <b>bandolon </b>(smaller guitar with 24 metal strings),<b> </b>and bamboo flute, and that they danced the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/77\"><b>pandanggo</b></a>,<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/62\">jota</a>,<i> </i>and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><b>balitaw</b></a>, though the more educated preferred waltz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/87\">polka</a>,<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\">habanera</a>,<b> </b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/58\">rigodon</a>,<b> </b>and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/67\"><i>lanceros</i></a>.<b><i> Informe Sobre el Estado de las Islas Filipinas en 1842</i> </b>(Information on the State of the Philippine Islands in 1842) by Sinibaldo de Mas cited an organ made of bamboo and told of the manufacture of harps and guitars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 19th century saw the publication of a number of travel accounts in English, including those by Otto Kotzebue, 1821; John White, 1823; A.M. Stewart, 1831; Abbey Jane Morrell, 1829-1833; Sir Edward Belcher, 1848; Frank S. Marryat, 1848; George Windsor Earl, 1853; Paul Proust de la Gironiere, 1854; Karl Scherzer, 1857-9; Henry T. Ellis, 1859; John Bowring, 1859; and Feodor Jagor, 1873. The descriptions of music showed how quickly Filipinos assimilated Spanish customs and practices. The educated urban upper class sang Andalucian songs and danced Spanish dances. Ellis wrote that the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/812\">harp</a> was &ldquo;the instrument of the country.&rdquo; Jagor described instruments such as the bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/832\">zither</a>, <b>baringbau</b>,<b> </b>and bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/817\">mouth harp</a> as similar to those of the Mintras of the Malay peninsula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many other travelogues were published in Spanish. Some were in French. M.G.L. de Rienzi and Gabriel Lafond, in 1836 and 1844, respectively, both wrote of the Filipino&rsquo;s love for music and their assimilation of European musical forms. Francisco Michelina y Rojas in 1843 described the elegant balls held in Manila homes. Jean Baptiste Mallat in 1846 described the <b>corrido</b>,<b> comintang de la conquista</b>,<b> sinanpablo</b>,<b> batangue&ntilde;o</b>,<b> </b>and <b>cavitegan</b>.<b> </b>He mentioned the <b>viguela </b>(guitar with many strings) as a favorite instrument, the bandolon, and a large <b>bajo de viguela</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jean de Man in 1875 described Manila theaters and mentioned the visit of an Italian opera troupe. Joseph Earle Stevens in 1909 described in more detail musical life in Manila and nearby environs in 1893-6. Francisco Ca&ntilde;amaque in 1877 echoed the much repeated observation of the Filipinos&rsquo; talent for assimilation. Other travellers who went further north or south briefly described indigenous music there. Manuel Scheidnagel in 1878 had terse descriptions of the <b>gansa </b>(flat gong), <b>sulibao </b>(cone-shaped drum), and <b>paggong </b>(three-holed flute) of northern Luzon. Joseph Montano in 1886, who travelled in 1879, described a quartet of ophicleide, guitar, and two flutes in connection with rice planting in Abucay, and the agun,<b> </b>kulintang,<b> </b>and various dances in the south. Juan Alvarez Guerra&rsquo;s <b><i>De Manila a Tayabas </i></b>(From Manila to Tayabas), 1878, and Manuel Sastron&rsquo;s <b><i>Filipinas</i></b>,<b><i> Peque&ntilde;os Estudios de Batangas </i></b>(Philippines, Short Studies on Batangas), 1895, described the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/781\"><b>kumintang</b></a>.<b> </b>However, Pedro Paterno went into more detail in <b><i>El Individuo Tagalo y Su Arte </i></b>(The Tagalog and his Art), 1893. He defined the kumintang, which originated from Balayan, Batangas, as an old type of melody with rhythms appropriate for Tagalog poetry, compared the kumintang of old with the &ldquo;modern,&rdquo; and included the text of a kumintang. Paterno called the kundiman<b> </b>the Filipino love song and also included a sample text, and described the balitaw as a national dance. The descriptive essay also mentioned the harp as well as older instruments such as the bamboo nose flutes and bamboo zithers.

Alexander Schadenberg travelled in southern Mindanao and northern Luzon. In <b><i>Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie</i></b><i> </i>(Yearbook for Ethnology), 1885-7, he described <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/122\">Bagobo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a>, and Guianen musical instruments and their uses, citing the Bagobo agun (gong), <b>plandong </b>(flute), <b>zuglum </b>(two-stringed boat lute), and <b>togo </b>(bamboo zithers). He also described the Tinguian nose flute, <b>boleton </b>(bamboo zither), <b>dedeco</b> (bamboo panpipes), and <b>buncacan </b>(bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/805\">buzzer</a>).

Volume 53 contains a 419-page bibliography with its own index of authors, while volumes 54 and 54, with their numerous cross-references, comprise the index. Wenceslao Emilio Retana&rsquo;s significant compilations include the three-volume <b><i>Aparato Bibliografico</i> <i>de la Historia General de Filipinas </i></b>(Bibliographic Apparatus of the General History of the Philippines), 1906, which chronologically lists down about 2,700 items preceded by an introduction about bibliographies and collections of Philippine materials, and the five-volume <b><i>Archivo del Bibliofilo Filipino </i></b>(Archive of the Filipino Bibliophile), 1895-1905, which lists unpublished manuscripts and rare printed items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The era saw more articles on various aspects of music which, although written in a popular rather than scholarly vein, shed light on how musicians and music lovers of the time thought, and offered insights and valuable information on indigenous and Western-influenced Philippine music. Most outstanding contributors to the literature included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4084\">Antonio J. Molina</a>, A.V.H.

Molina covered a wide range of topics, including biographical sketches of Filipino musicians like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\">Marcelo Adonay</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\">Ladislao Bonus</a>, discussions on Philippine music education, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\">folk songs</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/803\">rondalla</a>,<b> </b>church music, and musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many undergraduate and graduate theses did not deal directly with Philippine music, but with related subject matter (e.g., literature, folklore, epics, aspects of Western music). One of the earliest studies was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s (later Aquino) master of arts thesis, 1926, for the University of the Philippines (UP), which was expanded to become several editions and volumes on Philippine folk dances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><a id=\"period\" name=\"period\"></a>The Period of the Republics (1946-2014)</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Systematic studies on Philippine music began in the 1950s.

Titled <b><i>An Ethnomusicological</i> <i>Survey of the Philippines</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>it began with researches done in the field by Maceda on the Hanunuo in 1952, Kalinga in 1953, Maguindanaon and Tiruray in 1954, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> in 1956, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a> in 1960. He continued his research in the 1960s and 1970s, with modest financial support from the University Social Science Research Center, National Science Research Council, and the Council for Living Traditions. From 1985 to 1989, the Ford Foundation supported continuing research, including field work and laboratory work. The UP now has the largest and most representative scientific collection of Philippine music and the only one of its kind in Southeast Asia. It has 2,500 hours of music on tape from 51 ethnolinguistic groups, field notes, musical instruments, photographs, text transcriptions and translations, and music transcriptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From this material, students and research assistants of the DMR conducted special studies in the 1970s and 1980s: &ldquo;A Distribution of Polychordal Bamboo Zithers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Scale Formation of Bamboo Zither Instruments,&rdquo; &ldquo;Occasions for Music among the Tagalog,&rdquo; &ldquo;Scales in Two-stringed Boat Lutes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Sanghiyang Ritual of Cavite,&rdquo; &ldquo;Life Cycle of the Kalinga in Relation to Music,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ifugao Musical Terms,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tunings of the Kulintang,&rdquo; &ldquo;Classification of Flutes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Classification of Philippine Vocal Music,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tunings of 15 Bamboo Zithers,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Classification of Music of the Kalinga, Bontok, Cebuano, Ilocano, and Bicol.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1041\"><strong>Musika Jornal</strong></a> I</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1977, <b><i>II</i></b>,<b> </b>1978, and <b><i>III</i></b>,<b> </b>1980, and <b><i>Mga Paminsanang Sulatin sa Pananaliksik sa Musika</i></b> (Periodic Notes on Music Research), 1988, were published for school teachers, professionals, and students.

Conklin and Jose Maceda. The 20-page annotations contained ethnological descriptions of the Hanunuo, including occasions for use of music, detailed descriptions of the instruments, different types of vocal forms, as well as music analysis of each band in the recording, with some music transcriptions. A subsequent issue by Ethnic Folkways Library in 1957 titled Music of the World&rsquo;s Peoples culled samples from the Music of the Hanunuo with notes by Henry Cowell. The two-record album <b><i>Music of the Maguindanao</i></b> was issued in 1961 by Folkways Ethnic Library with annotations and recordings by Jose Maceda. The first record contained instrumental music. Rhythmic modes of the gong ensemble were discussed and amply illustrated with recordings of both the ensemble and individual instruments. The second record gave the various types of Maguindanaon vocal music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1970, the Indiana University Archives of Traditional Music and Folklore Institute produced a two-disk set, <b><i>Music from the Tausug of Sulu</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>with recordings, notes, and photographs by Thomas M.

Martenot and Maceda wrote the descriptions of the instruments, and Maceda prepared the musical transcriptions, tables, and analyses. Nicole and Charles MacDonald conducted fieldwork in Palawan, also funded by CEDRASEMI and the Fyssen Foundation.

The dictionary is divided into two parts: the first section consisting of an alphabetical listing of the indigenous groups and information on their musical culture, and the second, consisting of a dictionary of native terms found in the previous section. The 432 items do not all pertain to instruments. Editor Christian F. Feest added data on specimens of Philippine musical instruments in the Schadenberg collection at the Museum fur Volkerkunde, Vienna. The dictionary systematically compiles material from previously cited pre-1934 sources (i.e., Romualdez, Schadenberg, Scheerer, Garvan, Jenks, Beyer, Moss) and is therefore dated despite its recent publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Towards an Inventory of Philippine Musical Instruments</i></b>,<i> </i>1978, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\">E.

UP College of Music continued to lead in research outputs. In 1998, Jose Maceda with assistant Marialita Yraola, published the landmark book that summarized their organological survey of indigenous musical instruments begun four decades ago: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1031\"><b><i>Gongs and Bamboo: A Panorama of Philippine Music Instruments</i></b></a>. This came out a year after the UP Center for Ethnomusicology of the UP College of Music became separate from the Department of Music Research (presently called the Department of Musicology), to become an archive and research center. After Maceda&rsquo;s death in 2004, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4165\">Ramon P. Santos</a> became director of the UP Center for Ethnomusicology.

In this reference material, a new entry on the Spanish colonial music of Manila by historian William Summers appeared. Jose Maceda, Corazon Dioquino, and Ramon Santos later contributed essays in <b><i>The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music</i></b>, 1998. Dioquino also edited an anthology of articles published by the National Research Council of the Philippines, <b><i>Compendium of the Humanities of the Philippines: Musical Arts</i></b>. Meanwhile, the UP Center for Ethnomusicology revived Jose Maceda&rsquo;s <b><i>Musika Jornal</i></b> which contained essays on different topics since 2008.

The Musicological Society of the Philippines came at a time when graduates of the UP College of Music who earned doctoral degrees in music, mostly in the United States, came home to teach in the country. Jose Buenconsejo inaugurated a type of music research that was wholly contextual, interpreting the meaning of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2329\">Agusanon Manobo</a> ritual song <b>tud-om</b> against the background of mythology and political economy in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1045\"><b><i>Songs and Gifts at the Frontier: Person and Exchange in the Agusan Manobo Possession Ritual, Philippines</i></b></a>, 2002. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3962\">LaVerne de la Pe&ntilde;a</a>, previously active in composition, wrote an ethnomusicological work &ldquo;Traversing Boundaries: A Situated Music Approach to the Study of Day-Eng Performance Among the Kankana-Ey of Northern Philippines,&rdquo; 2000.

A student of Jose Maceda, Racquel Berdon-Georsua, finished her doctorate in Australian on ritual music titled &ldquo;Where Heaven and Earth Meet: The <strong>Buklog</strong> of the Subanen in Zamboanga Peninsula, Western Mindanao, the Philippines&rdquo; (University of Melbourne), 2004, and thereafter taught at Cebu Normal University. Then a year after, Kristina Benitez finished her dissertation on &ldquo;The Maguindanaon Kulintang: Musical Innovation, Transformation and the Concept of Binalig,&rdquo; 2005, and returned home to teach at the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU). Benitez later established a PhD in ethnomusicology program at PWU<i>.</i> Another graduate of the musicology program from UP College of Music was Pamela Grace Costes who finished her PhD with a work on translocal Philippine music, &ldquo;Tunog Pil-Am: Creating and Reinventing the Sound of the Filipino Natives of America,&rdquo; University of Washington at Seattle, 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other alumni of the UP College of Music also finished their doctoral degrees in the previous decade. They researched on aspects of Philippine music that deal with music repertory and style analysis. In 1992, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\">Raul Sunico</a> wrote a PhD dissertation for the faculty of the School of Education, Health, Nursing and Arts Professions in New York University titled &ldquo;Selected Philippine Piano Concerti: A Performance Guide.&rdquo; For his doctor of musical arts (DMA) degree in choral conducting, Joel M. Navarro wrote &ldquo;A Style Study of Selected Choral Works of Ramon Pagayon Santos,&rdquo; 2006. Then in 2010, Abelardo Galang wrote &ldquo;The Development of Philippine Piano Literature&rdquo; for the Technical University in Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside of the UP College of Music, many contributed to music research as well. Arsenio Nicolas Jr wrote &ldquo;Musical Exchange in Early Southeast Asia: The Philippines and Indonesia, Ca. 100 to 1600 Ce&rdquo; for his PhD degree at Cornell University, 2007. A number of articles published in international journals came out of this work. Nicolas finished a master&rsquo;s degree at the UP Asian Center, which was also where <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4102\">Grace Nono</a> studied. She turned her master&rsquo;s thesis into a book on the orality of Philippine traditional song titled <b><i>The Shared Voice: Chanted and Spoken Narratives from the Philippines</i></b>, 2008. Grace Nono continued her interest in orality and extended this into the realm of indigenous spirituality in <b><i>Song of the Babaylan: Living Voices, Medicines, Spiritualities of Philippine Ritualist-Oralist-Healers</i></b>, 2013. In 2014, she finished her PhD at New York University with a dissertation titled &ldquo;Babaylan Sing Back: Philippine Shamans on Voice, Gender, and Transnationalism.&rdquo; Another UP alumna who did music research was Fredeliza Z. Campos of the UP Archeological Studies Program who wrote &ldquo;A Study of the Musical Instruments of Ifugao in the Cordillera Region, Northern Philippines&rdquo; for her master in philosophy degree at the University of Hong Kong, 2012. And from the theater program at the UP College of Arts and Letters, meL&ecirc; Yamomo wrote &ldquo;Sounding Modernities: Music and Theatre in Manila and the Asia Pacific, 1869-1948&rdquo; for the Ludwig Maximilians Universit&auml;t-M&uuml;nchen in Munich, Germany, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As there was not yet a doctoral program in music at the UP College of Music in the early 2000s, a number of its faculty went to the tri-college Philippine Studies program in UP and earned their degrees in Philippine studies, albeit still writing on Philippine music. The first to finish from the UP College of Music was Raul C. Navarro who crafted a dissertation in Filipino, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1033\">Kolonyal na Patakaran at ang Nagbabagong Kamalayang Filipino: Musika sa Publikong Paaralan sa Pilipinas, 1898-1935</a> </i></b>(Colonial Policy and the Changing Mindset of the Filipino: Music in Philippine Public Schools, 1898-1935), 2007. He followed this up with another book in Filipino, <b><i>Musika at Bagong Lipunan: Pagbuo ng Lipunang Filipino, 1972-1986 </i></b>(Music and the New Society: The Creation of the Filipino Society, 1972-1986), 2014. After Navarro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3885\">Jonas Baes</a> in the PhD Philippine Studies, College of Social Science and Philosophy, wrote &ldquo;Modes of Appropriation in Philippine Indigenous Music: The Politics of the Production of Cultural Difference,&rdquo; 2004. He was followed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4092\">Christine Muyco</a> who wrote a dissertation &ldquo;Sibod in Binanog: Understanding of the Binanog Tradition of the Panay Bukidnon (Philippines),&rdquo; 2008. Lastly, for the Philippine Studies in UP Asian Center, Michiyo Yoneno-Reyes finished her PhD with &ldquo;Unsettling &lsquo;Salidummay&rsquo;: A Historico-ethnography of a Music Category,&rdquo; 2010. Music scholars of this decade actively disseminated their papers in conferences organized by local academic societies such as the Philippine National Historical Society, Bagong Kasaysayan, UGAT (Anthropological Association of the Philippines), and the Arts Studies Association and by international societies like International Conference of Philippine Studies, International Conference in Philippine Linguistics, International Council for Traditional Music, and the Performing Arts of Southeast Asia Study Group. Consequently, these papers resulted in conference proceedings and publications in local and international journals like <b><i>Musika Jornal</i></b>, <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>, <b><i>Journal of Asian Studies</i></b>, <b><i>Daluyan</i></b>, <b><i>Budhi</i></b>, <b><i>Saliksik</i></b> (of Bagong Kasaysayan), <b><i>Plaridel</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/524\"><strong>Bulawan</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Journal for the Arts, Culture, and the Humanities</i></b> (UST), <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>, and <b><i>Kritika</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2011, the UP College of Music organized an international conference on the theme &ldquo;The Impact of Music in Shaping Southeast Asian Societies&rdquo; where topics on music in Philippine popular cultures were represented. These were LaVerne de la Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s &ldquo;Verse versus Verse: the Articulation of Changing Filipino Sensibilities in the Performance of the Repartee of Day-eng, Awit, and Pinoy Rap,&rdquo; Michiyo Yoneno-Reyes&rsquo;s &ldquo;American Movie Songs and the Salidummay in the Northern Luzon Highlands,&rdquo; meL&ecirc; Yamomo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Global Currents, Musical Streams: the Musical Trade Route between Europe and Manila in Early Globalization,&rdquo; Jose S. Buenconsejo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Philippine Piano Music Folklore circa 1860s: An Early Articulation of Filipino Identity,&rdquo; Christi-Anne Castro&rsquo;s &ldquo;Musicking Race: U.S. and Philippine Encounters,&rdquo; and Renato Lucas&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Preliminary Annotation of Selected Discography by Filipino Artists, 1913&ndash;1946.&rdquo; Topics on music and politics that are a staple in new critical musicology were apparent as well as seen in Jonas Baes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Patangis-Buwaya: Research and a Philosophy of Praxis in Music Composition in Southeast Asia&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4099\">Raul Navarro</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Propaganda-Image and Music: The Making of the New Society, 1965-1986.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another conference was organized by the UP College of Music in cooperation with the UP College of Mass Communications in 2013, this time on the theme &ldquo;Seeing-Sounding Social Transformation in (The Music) of Philippine Theaters.&rdquo; The politics of cultures was again highlighted such as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5517\">Resil Mojares</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Musica Moralia: The Buenaventuras, Music, and Politics,&rdquo; Teresita Maceda&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pagkanta ng Totoo sa mga Lipunang Sinilensyo,&rdquo; Roselle Pineda&rsquo;s &ldquo;Femmecees Reprznt! The Lives, Strides and Rhymes of Filipina Rappers at the Dawn of Pinoy Hip-hop in the Late 80s and Early 90s,&rdquo; Jose S. Buenconsejo&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Many-splendoured Kundiman in the &lsquo;Paki-usap&rsquo; Film Score (1940): A criticism on the Seeing-Sounding of &lsquo;Romantic Love&rsquo; in a Philippine Feudalistic Class Structure,&rdquo; and Nicanor G. Tiongson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Contesting Ideologies in the Theater of 1902.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As ease of travel across nation-state borders made it easy for scholars to do fieldwork in the country, the subject of Philippine music attracted foreign scholars. The majority of these were Americans like Stephen Grauberger who wrote a master&rsquo;s thesis on &ldquo;Diatonic Harp of the Philippines: An Historical Overview and an Organological Comparison of the Cebuano-Bisayan Harp&rdquo; for the University of Hawaii Manoa, 1994. This was followed by David Joseph Kendall&rsquo;s PhD dissertation on &ldquo;Spanish Colonial Liturgical Music in the Philippines: Inventing a Tradition,&rdquo; 2010, and Neal D. Matherne&rsquo;s &ldquo;Naming the Artist, Composing the Philippines: Listening for the Nation in the National Artist Award,&rdquo; 2014. Both were from the University of California Riverside. Filipino-Americans at UCLA such as Christi-Anne Castro and Mary Talusan wrote about Philippine music, the former writing a cultural history dissertation that became the book <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1040\"><strong>Musical Renderings of the Philippine Nation</strong></a></i></b>, 2011, while the latter dealt with &ldquo;Cultural Localization and Transnational Flows: Music in the Magindanaon Communities of the Philippines,&rdquo; 2005. Almost a decade later, another Filipino-American named Marilyne Antonette Adiova researched on the &ldquo;Music, Dance, and Negotiations of Identity in the Religious Festivals of Bicol, Philippines,&rdquo; 2014, for her PhD dissertation at the University of Michigan. And in 2015, another Fil-Am, Bernard Ellorin completed his dissertation on the &ldquo;Trans-cultural commodities: the Sama-Bajau Pan Musical Industries and Identities on the Peripheries of Maritime Southeast Asia,&rdquo; University of Hawaii, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Non-American researchers include Japanese Yoshitaka Terada who worked on Maranao kulintang; Australian Manolote Mora who did years of fieldwork in Mindanao and who came up with an outstanding book <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1042\"><b><i>Myth, Mimesis and Magic in the Music of the T&rsquo;Boli, Philippines</i></b></a>, 2008; David RM Irving who engaged intensively with written records to produce <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1027\"><strong>Colonial Counterpoint: Music in Early Modern Manila</strong></a></i></b>, 2010; and South African Lee William Watkins who interviewed Filipino musicians and wrote &ldquo;Minstrelsy in the Margin Re-Covering the Memories and Lives of Filipino Musicians in Hong Kong&rdquo; for the University of Hong Kong. This work on Filipino popular culture is similar to Malaysian Stephanie Sooklynn Ng&rsquo;s dissertation &ldquo;Filipino Bands Performing in Hotels, Clubs and Restaurants in Asia: Purveyors of Transnational Culture in a Global Arena,&rdquo; submitted to the University of Michigan in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decade 2000 was indeed very productive. New topics in Philippine musicology and new theoretical approaches such as ethnographic/cultural history, analysis and music criticism, and popular music culture came to the fore. Top among these researches was the subfield of historical musicology, which is characterized by archival research methods that interpret social meanings in music manuscripts and prints. Maria Alexandra I&ntilde;igo Chua transformed her UP master&rsquo;s thesis in musicology into a book that decoded early 19th century archaic liturgical music notation, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1032\"><b><i>Kirial de Baclayon, A&ntilde;o 1826: Hispanic Sacred Music in 19th Century Bohol, Philippines</i></b></a>, 2010. She was inspired by the works of music historian William Summers, who published findings in the local journal <b><i>Budhi: A Journal of Ideas and Culture</i></b><i> </i>titled &ldquo;Listening for Historic Manila: Music and Rejoicing in an International City&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rediscovering the Hidden Muses of Bohol: Filipino Music Maestri From Corella Church, Bohol.&rdquo; Within this circle of historical musicologists, David Irving also contributed new knowledge about music in Manila from the 17th to 18th centuries, such as his essay on the &ldquo;Historical and Literary Vestiges of the Villancico in the Early Modern Philippines&rdquo; that appeared in the book <b><i>Devotional Music in the Iberian World, 1450-1800</i></b>, 2007. Irving also wrote &ldquo;Keyboard Instruments and Instrumentalists in Manila&rdquo; in <b><i>Anuario Musical</i></b> <b><i>60</i></b>, 2005, and &ldquo;Musical Politics of Empire: The Loa in Eighteen-Century Manila&rdquo; in <b><i>Early Music</i></b>, 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Interest in historical musicology also influenced local scholars, notably Elena Rivera Mirano, who wrote <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1034\"><b><i>The Life and Works of Marcelo Adonay</i></b></a>, 2009. On a separate stream, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4009\">Antonio C. Hila</a> who was primarily trained as a historian, published his essays in<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/41/1037\">Music in History, History in Music</a></i></b>, 2004. This book encompassed the broad field of history and criticism. From the UP College of Arts and Letters, Juliet Bien wrote a master&rsquo;s thesis titled &ldquo;The Invencion of Calabanga, Camrines Sur: The Dynamics of Family, Land, and Power,&rdquo; 2009 and, for the same degree, Patricia Lopez wrote &ldquo;Expressions of Devotion: The Flores de Mayo in Poblacion, Oslob,&rdquo; 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Independent initiatives in Philippine music research were also a new feature of this period. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4135\">Richie Quirino</a> compiled sources to write anecdotal books on the history of jazz in the Philippines. Robert L. Yoder wrote the history of the famed early 20th century Philippine Constabulary,<b> <i>In Performance: Walter Howard Loving and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4121\"><strong>Philippine Constabulary Band</strong></a></i></b>, 2013. In addition, the period also saw the flowering of biographies, many of which were hagiographies being self-published or commissioned like <b><i>de la Torre</i></b>, 1985; <b><i>Lucresia Kasilag</i></b>, 2000; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4222\"><b><i><strong>Andrea Veneracion</strong></i></b></a>, 2001; <b><i>Antonino Buenaventura</i></b>, 2004; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4117\"><b><i>Angel Pe&ntilde;a</i></b></a> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3936\"><strong>Diego Cera</strong></a></i></b>, 2008; and <b><i>Salido</i></b>, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Gilopez Kabayao</strong></a></strong></i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4008\"><b><i>Juan de Sahagun Hernandez</i></b></a>, 2010. While a critical researcher would naturally be aware of the partiality of these works, these biographies are, nonetheless, important source materials for doing a more systematic research on acculturated Philippine music traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the upsurge in research about Philippine music history, the field of ethnomusicology was not neglected because there were indeed works that were ethnomusicological, yet still in keeping with the 1990s pre-occupation with reflexivity and intersubjectivity. Ricardo D. Trimillos wrote &ldquo;Agency and Voice: The Philippines at the 1998 Smithsonian Folklife Festival.&rdquo; This appeared in the book <b><i>Music and Cultural Rights</i></b>, 2009. He also touched upon politics in the article &ldquo;Histories, Resistances, and Reconciliations in a Decolonizable Space: The Philippine Delegation to the 1998 Smithsonian Folklife Festival,&rdquo; which was published in <b><i>The Journal of American Folklore</i></b>, 2008. French anthropological linguist Nicole Revel re-issued her 1980 recordings in a CD with informative notes titled <b><i>Philippines Musique Des Hautes-Terres Palawan</i></b>, 1992, which had music descriptions by Jose Maceda. Revel also continued her work on epics and produced an analysis of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5502\">Masinu</a>&rsquo;s epic <b><i>The Quest for a Wife: A Palawan Epic</i></b>, 2000, and, with Harry Nimmo and Alain Martenot, wrote the <b><i>Silungan Baltapa: Le Voyage au Ciel d&rsquo;un H&eacute;ros Sama</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>The Voyage to Heaven of a Sama Hero</i></b>), 2005. Her project <b><i>Literature of Voice: Epics in the Philippines</i></b>, 2005, is particularly important because it is a fruit of an honest collaboration with indigenous artists, in particular with the Saway family of Bukidnon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from Trimillos and Revel, other foreign scholars published Philippine music research. Like Revel&rsquo;s aforementioned book, these were in collaboration with local scholars such as Matthew C. M. Santamaria whose essay was included in Alain Martenot, Birgit Abels, and Hanafi Hussin&rsquo;s <b><i>Oceans of Sound: Sama Dilaut Performing Arts, Dedicated to Alain Martenot (1946-2010)</i></b>, 2012. Another scholar was Glenn Stallsmith of Summer Institute of Linguistics who worked in the Cordillera in Luzon, whose essay was included in Brigit Abels&rsquo;s monography titled <b><i>Austronesian Soundscapes: Performing Arts in Oceania and Southeast Asia</i></b>, 2011. Michiyo Yoneno-Reyes continued to deal with popular culture and wrote the essay &ldquo;Under Attack: Mass Media Technology and Indigenous Musical Practices in the Philippines,&rdquo; which appeared in <b><i>Global Goes Local: Popular Culture in Asia,</i></b> edited by Timothy J. Craig, and Richard King, 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period covering music research from 1992 to the present would not be complete without mentioning Craig A. Lockard&rsquo;s essay on Philippine protest songs, which was a chapter in his book <b><i>Dance of Life: Popular Music and Politics in Southeast Asia</i></b>, 1998, and Teresita G. Maceda&rsquo;s book <b><i>Mga Tinig Mula sa Ibaba: Kasaysayan ng Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas at Sosialistang Partido ng Pilipinas sa Awit, 1930-1955 </i></b>(Voices from the Grassroots: The History of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party of the Philippines in Song, 1930-1955),<b><i> </i></b>1996, which was about underground political songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Not too many books have been published on popular contemporary forms, so Richie Quirino&rsquo;s three-volume work on Filipino jazz traditions is truly pioneering and seminal. These include <b><i>Pinoy <strong>Jazz</strong> Tradition</i></b><em><strong>s</strong></em>, 2004, covering the history of jazz in the Philippines from 1898 to the 1960s; <b><i>Mabuhay Jazz: Jazz in Postwar Philippines</i></b>, 2008, recounting jazz history from the 1950s to the 1970s; and <b><i>Contemporary Jazz in the Philippines: 1970 to the Year 2010</i></b>, 2011, focusing on jazz during martial law up to the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musicological and ethnomusicological scholarship in the Philippines has a long history. Still, many fields of study remain to be explored. Studies have just begun to tap into the vast wealth of the Filipino musical heritage. There is a need for more extensive collection and preservation of music, especially in the contexts of change and acculturation that are inevitable. Informed by recent perspectives in postcolonial studies and performance theory, documentations of Philippine music should not be limited to understanding why traditions endure or are &ldquo;re-invented,&rdquo; but also how they respond specifically to modernities that result in cultural hybridities. It is also equally urgent to organize collected material so that it is available for further study. More text translations and music transcriptions are needed so that collected material can be properly evaluated. But, in addition to such organizing and collecting, these materials need to be understood as responses to particular historical moments. Only then can the fundamental structures of music in the Philippines, and the relationships between music and society be properly described.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Corazon C.

As a scholarly discipline in the university, musicology did not exist in the Philippines before 1950, although inquiries into the subject of Philippine music had begun much earlier, as seen in the works of intellectuals like <a href=\"/9/80/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a>, <a href=\"/5/42/3924\">Fernando Canon</a>, Epifanio de los Santos, Raymundo Ba&#xF1;as, <a href=\"/7/7/3225\">Norberto Romualdez</a>, and Alfredo Roa. There is much material prior to 1950 which may not be technically &#x201C;musicological&#x201D; or &#x201C;ethnomusicological&#x201D; but is of great value to the music scholar and historian. The material includes accounts in journals, magazines, newspapers, monographs, books, and related studies written mostly by anthropologists, linguists, folklorists, and cultural historians. Information can also be gleaned from the writings of early explorers, travelers, missionaries, and civil servants."

New topics in Philippine musicology and new theoretical approaches such as ethnographic/cultural history, analysis and music criticism, and popular music culture came to the fore. Top among these researches was the subfield of historical musicology, which is characterized by archival research methods that interpret social meanings in music manuscripts and prints. Maria Alexandra I&#xF1;igo Chua transformed her UP master&#x2019;s thesis in musicology into a book that decoded early 19th century archaic liturgical music notation, <a href=\"/5/41/1032\"><b><i>Kirial de Baclayon, A&#xF1;o 1826: Hispanic Sacred Music in 19th Century Bohol, Philippines</i></b></a>, 2010.

Studies have just begun to tap into the vast wealth of the Filipino musical heritage. There is a need for more extensive collection and preservation of music, especially in the contexts of change and acculturation that are inevitable. Informed by recent perspectives in postcolonial studies and performance theory, documentations of Philippine music should not be limited to understanding why traditions endure or are &#x201C;re-invented,&#x201D; but also how they respond specifically to modernities that result in cultural hybridities. It is also equally urgent to organize collected material so that it is available for further study. More text translations and music transcriptions are needed so that collected material can be properly evaluated. But, in addition to such organizing and collecting, these materials need to be understood as responses to particular historical moments. Only then can the fundamental structures of music in the Philippines, and the relationships between music and society be properly described.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Corazon C.

They are paid fees for services rendered in a given musical setting, whether it be in the movie industry to play the film score of the composer or arranger; in a television or radio broadcast, either pre-recorded or live; in theater, whether it be <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a>, musical revue, stage play, or Broadway hit; in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/772\">chamber</a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestral</a> performances; or in recording studio sessions working for record companies or commercial advertisement agencies. A session musician specializes in one or more styles of playing, depending on his or her skills and training. The more styles a musician can do, the more gigs the musician can play in.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The earliest Filipino session musicians were those who played in secular public concerts organized by the Union Artistico Musical, an umbrella organization of orchestral instrumentalists founded by Manuel Garrido and Carlos Saco del Valle on 16 Apr 1885 in the house of Pedro Gruet in Sampaloc. It would seem that even at that time, Filipino session musicians were hired not only in the Philippines but as far as Shanghai. As early as 1878-9, Jean Remusat visited Manila to recruit Filipino musicians to join the Shanghai Public Band, the predecessor of the 1881 Shanghai Municipal Orchestra. Another group of 19 musicians were recruited in 1881 by Spanish Melchior Vela to work in the same city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American colonial period, session musicians were kept busy in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\"><i>bodabil</i></a> shows of the 1920s and 1930s. Their names, however, were forgotten because attention was on the stars of the shows such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\">Lou Borromeo</a>, Hispanic Enrique Davila and wife Consuelo, and Filipino-Americans &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo; Reantaso and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\">Santiago Suarez</a> who both toured America. One can only surmise that these session musicians were only employed to make the entertainment scene more dynamic and diverse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manila in the 1920s continued to be linked to other capitals of the world, particularly to Shanghai, China, the &ldquo;Paris of the East,&rdquo; whose nightlife was vibrant until the 1940s. This bustling community, like many other cities, demanded live entertainment such as that provided by dance bands, but the locals had no background and exposure to Western music. To fill the need Filipinos who had been trained in Western music were hired. Among these imports were Ramon Baclay, Mike Vilela, Ponching Garcia, and Vic Tulio, who were identified as Filipino session musicians by the British national Nick Demuth, a pianist-arranger in Shanghai before 1949. In the early 1930s, the Dila Brothers, notably Apolo and Toots who both played the trumpet, Ading and Fany who played the tenor sax and alto sax, respectively, and the youngest in the brood, drummer Romy, also worked as session musicians in Shanghai. This family of talented musicians, who were proficient sight readers and were always in demand for studio recordings, live radio broadcasts, and film scores, called themselves the Shanghai Swing Masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Session musicians were often employed by composer-arrangers who had the knack of picking the right musician for the designated job. One such luminary was Federico Elizalde, a Spanish-American mestizo, who was considered a Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">jazz</a> icon despite not having a drop of native blood in him. Unknown to Filipinos of the pre-World War II era, the brothers Federico and Manolo were already into making music in the United States where they had been sent for schooling. Federico was a guiding light in the development of jazz from the 1930s up to the early 1970s. He organized a string orchestra featuring solo clarinetist Nemesio Regalado and had a regular weekly radio program at DZPI called <b><i>Family Hour</i></b>. Federico employed a handful of session musicians from the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me such as guitarist-bassist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4117\">Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a</a>, trumpeters Apolo and Toots Dila, Vestre Roxas, and pianist and elder brother of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>, Ping Joaquin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the 1930s, the Swing Era or Big Band Era was big business. This new type of jazz that swept America and the rest of the world was highly commercialized and danceable and enjoyed tremendous popularity in the Philippines. The band leaders-arrangers who made a name for themselves and employed numerous session musicians were the following: Pete Aristorenas, a superb saxophone player and bandleader who for many years played overseas; Iggy de Guzman, whose orchestra performed at the EM club in Clark Field Air Base in Pampanga; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4203\">Restie Umali</a>, who became the staff arranger of Federico Elizalde&rsquo;s weekly Radio program; Tirso Cruz Sr, whose Mabuhay Orchestra performed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>&rsquo;s Fiesta Pavilion; Serafin Payawal, whose orchestra performed at the Sky Room of the Jai-Alai; Tino Gatchalian, whose big band played at a classy cabaret called the International Ballroom located at Grace Park in Caloocan; and Maximo Isla, who headed the house band of the Sta. Ana Cabaret.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the Manila Hotel, Tirso Cruz Sr, like Duke Ellington, handpicked the best instrumentalists based on their respective styles to suit the tailor-cut repertoire. After 1945, at the Manila Hotel&rsquo;s Fiesta Pavilion and later at the Winter Garden, the familiar names that surrounded Cruz were the Dila brothers on trumpets; Simeon de Luna on the clarinet; Avelino Cortez on first alto sax; Tomeng Gonzaga on second alto sax; Romy Pascasio on second tenor sax; Epitanio Ilustre on baritone sax; Fred Azteca on lead trumpet; Charlie Reyes on second trumpet; Elpidio Ebron on trombone; Ben Conti on piano; Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a on guitar and as an arranger; Cristino &ldquo;Tinoy&rdquo; Umali Sr on bass; Cesar Cruz on drums; and Rebecca Gonzales on vocals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bassist Johnny Gosalvez worked with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\">Ariston Avelino</a>, an arranger, for Bataan Records label. It was during these years that the commercial record industry started. Bataan Records, under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4045\">Cecil Lloyd</a>, the so-called &ldquo;mystery singer,&rdquo; was established due to a growing demand for homegrown talents who were already popular among the masses. The live club performance circuit as well as the live radio broadcasts widened the scope and audiences of these seasoned artists, which were good enough reasons for them to be recorded. Some of the artists under the Bataan Records stable were Cecil Lloyd who was of African-American descent; Mama <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a>; Esen &ldquo;Priscilla the Kolynos Girl&rdquo; Aristorenas; Baby Jane; Viring; Serafin Garcia; Ray Alinsod and his orchestra; Carlos Aguilar and his Rhumbandidos; Tirso Cruz Sr and his Riviera Orchestra; and Ariston Avelino and his band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The time was indeed ripe to record these entertainers and make their music available on vinyl discs for mass distribution even to the farthest provinces. Bataan Records&rsquo; main office was located along Raon Street in Quiapo, Manila. Raon Street was the hub of the commercial music industry scene where music retail stores mushroomed and musical instruments of various brands, scores of music and records, were selling like hotcakes. Much of Bataan Records&rsquo; stock was available on consignment in other Manila outlets such as L.R. Villar along Escolta, Cajapin Radio Service and Supply along Carriedo, and the Manila Supply Company, also situated in Raon. Provincial dealers reached as far as Quezon and Pampanga and in the Visayas, Iloilo, Bacolod, and Cebu. Other record labels followed such as MBC (Manila Broadcasting Corporation) Records of Federico Elizalde, which released in 1951 the Christmas Medley arranged by Restie Umali and sung by Esen &ldquo;Priscilla&rdquo; Aristorenas, with Elizalde conducting the Manila Little Symphony. The Presto Label, which released <b><i>Prelude to a <strong>Concerto</strong></i></b>, featuring the Pete Aristorenas Orchestra, was also very much in demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1951, the Philippine Musicians&rsquo; Guild was organized and subsequently registered with the Department of Labor. The guild sought to protect the musicians who played music for a living. Its objectives were to (1) negotiate for minimum rates through collective bargaining; (2) protect against unjust dismissal or dismissal without notice; (3) provide Social Security coverage for musicians; and (4) work against the use of the minus one and recorded music that would displace musicians and other performers. The original organizers of the Guild were Hilarion Raymundo, Ping Joaquin, Don Chico, Ray Alinsod, Graciano Pujante, Peping Contreras, Chino Santos, Fred Robles, Johnny Gosalvez, and Restie Umali. This was the only union certified by the Supreme Court as the sole bargaining representative of musicians in the recording industry and, historically, it was the successor of the 19th century Union Artistico Musical. The Guild&rsquo;s office was at the corner of Rizal Avenue and Raon Streets in Sta. Cruz, Manila, an area referred to as a <i>palengke</i> (market) for musicians.

It would seem that even at that time, Filipino session musicians were hired not only in the Philippines but as far as Shanghai. As early as 1878-9, Jean Remusat visited Manila to recruit Filipino musicians to join the Shanghai Public Band, the predecessor of the 1881 Shanghai Municipal Orchestra. Another group of 19 musicians were recruited in 1881 by Spanish Melchior Vela to work in the same city."

This bustling community, like many other cities, demanded live entertainment such as that provided by dance bands, but the locals had no background and exposure to Western music. To fill the need Filipinos who had been trained in Western music were hired. Among these imports were Ramon Baclay, Mike Vilela, Ponching Garcia, and Vic Tulio, who were identified as Filipino session musicians by the British national Nick Demuth, a pianist-arranger in Shanghai before 1949. In the early 1930s, the Dila Brothers, notably Apolo and Toots who both played the trumpet, Ading and Fany who played the tenor sax and alto sax, respectively, and the youngest in the brood, drummer Romy, also worked as session musicians in Shanghai. This family of talented musicians, who were proficient sight readers and were always in demand for studio recordings, live radio broadcasts, and film scores, called themselves the Shanghai Swing Masters."

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Recording refers to the process of making copies of a piece or pieces of music for public dissemination. The process includes the preproduction phase, in which the producers and their assistants decide on the concept, programming, and performance of the piece/pieces of music; the production phase, which includes the creation of the musical arrangements, the rehearsals, the actual performance and recording, and the editing and mixing; and the postproduction phase, which concentrates on the duplication of copies, and the promotion and marketing of the finished products.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The making of a record begins with the search for material. The producer can personally ask composers for new works or do research on unrecorded music in the music library, usually housed within the premises of the recording company. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">Popular music</a> composers include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4155\">Jess Saclo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4183\">Danny Subido</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3949\">Ernani Cuenco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3925\">George Canseco</a>, Vic Villafuerte, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4007\">Mike Hanopol</a>, Joey &ldquo;Pepe&rdquo; Smith, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3857\">Freddie Aguilar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3899\">Heber Bartolome</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3947\">Willy Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4113\">Jim Paredes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4022\">Danny Javier</a>, Gines Tan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4192\">Danny Tan</a>, Florante de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4002\">Gary Granada</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3937\">Jose Mari Chan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3961\">Ernie de la Pe&ntilde;a</a>, Nonong Pedero, Cecile Azarcon-Palma, Odette Quesada, Nonoy Gallardo, Paul Galang, Charo Unite, Tats Faustino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4144\">Snaffu Rigor</a>, Nonoy Tan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4167\">Vehnee Saturno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4214\">Rey Valera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4105\">Louie Ocampo</a>, Jimmy Antiporda, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4213\">Gary Valenciano</a>. In this search for material, the producer is assisted by the audition and research (A &amp; R) person, who takes care of looking for talents and studios to be rented, establishing contacts with the arranger and sound engineers, and attending to the copyright demands of the selected songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A preproduction meeting is set so that the singer, the producer, the A &amp; R person, and preferably the arranger, can hear and study prospective materials. For a more objective evaluation of their works, the composer of these materials is usually excluded from the discussion. The group brainstorms and decides on the concept of the record, including the final selections, the type of arrangement needed, and the target audience (i.e., rural or urban). The producer gives all the guidelines to the singer, who will then study the lyrics and melody for a week or so before recording sessions formally start.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The production phase is usually the domain of an audio recording engineer. He is responsible for recording, manipulating, mixing, and mechanically reproducing sound. He works closely with songwriters, music arrangers, and especially session musicians, vocalists, and instrumentalists who render parts of musical arrangements in sound studios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">First to be recorded or dubbed is the minus one or the instrumental accompaniment. The arranger creates this according to the guidelines laid out by the producer as to the desired beat, key, and instrumentation. Some of the music industry&rsquo;s arrangers are Domingo Amarillo, Emi and Eddie Munji, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4505\">Jun Latonio</a>, Emil Mijares, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4015\">Lorrie Ilustre</a>, Danny Favis, Amado Trivi&ntilde;o, Butch Miraflor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4117\">Angel M. Pe&ntilde;a</a>, Rey Magtoto, and Dante Trinidad, most of whom have harnessed their talents in arranging song-entries to the Metropop contest. Others have branched into musical direction for TV shows or concerts: Dominic Salustiano was the resident arranger and musical director of RPN 9&rsquo;s <b><i>Bagong Kampeon</i></b> (New Champion), a popular amateur singing contest on TV; Mon Faustino regularly did the arrangements for Gary Valenciano&rsquo;s concerts; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4227\">Mel Villena</a> was the regular musical director of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\">Sharon Cuneta</a>&rsquo;s concerts here and abroad; Homer Flores was the regular musical director of musical variety shows like <b><i>Vilma!</i></b> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\">Eat Bulaga</a></em></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong><em>!</em></strong></a>; and Egay Gonzales did several musical directing stints in local concerts of pop singing idols and was also the musical director of the Sunday noontime show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1503\">Sa Linggo nAPO Sila</a></i></b>. Some arrangers devoted most of their time to individual singers, like Alvin Nu&ntilde;ez who regularly did the arrangements of Jose Mari Chan&rsquo;s songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The singer is asked to attend this first recording session to make sure he or she is comfortable with the key of the accompaniment. Once the arrangement is approved, the arranger rehearses the session musicians who have been recruited by the A &amp; R person. When the musicians are ready, the recording is done. Before the singer&rsquo;s voice is recorded, though, he or she may listen to the songs as sung by the composer with the minus one and from there create his or her own interpretation of the song. The singer undergoes lengthy rehearsals with the producer or composer for emotional motivation and musical approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the lead vocals have been recorded, another session is set for the backup vocals, as required by the arranger. The lead performer need not be present at this point because the support vocalists can already go by his or her voice track in the minus one. Session musicians used to be recruited from Aroma Cafe in the post-World War II decades. Later, individual musicians were contacted directly or drawn from established orchestras. Some of the session musicians who recorded for the industry were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4172\">Polding Silos</a>, Jun Regalado, Roger Herrera, Narding Casta&ntilde;eda, Ponching Belsonda, and Rudy Lozano, as well as musicians from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The editing-mixing stage is considered the most crucial. Here, the various recorded tracks are manipulated to create an aural picture of the entire performance. The trained ears of mixers intimately attend to the details, as they study each track to decide which instrument must be heard only on the left or right speaker, or which song should be added if there are still vacant tracks available. As with the vocals, it is here where the singer or singers&rsquo; mistakes and deficiencies can be electronically corrected and improved through proper adjustments on the reverb, echo, or sustain functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of the technology that the music recording industry in the United States developed from the 1960s to the present have been imported and used through the last three decades by major Filipino-owned recording companies. Some notable technological innovations of the last decade include the multitrack systems of recording sounds and the use of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/829\">synthesizers</a>. The commercial viability of sound recordings also brought musical entrepreneurship into vogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the introduction of the synthesizer in the 1980s, recording sessions have become much more explorative than ever. Not only is this computer-aided equipment capable of reproducing sound, but it can also push the limits of one&rsquo;s audial fantasy by virtually inventing new sounds. Recordings channeled through synthesizers achieve the desired balance of sounds through the preprogrammed tracking assignments. An obvious drawback of a total dependence on synthesizers, however, is that it can dehumanize the recording session or render it mechanical and predictable. It can replace the human fingers on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">piano</a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, and can mask or eliminate a singer&rsquo;s faltering notes, giving a wrong impression of the singer&rsquo;s abilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Towards the mid-1980s, keyboard devices and synthesizers became very affordable in the Philippines. By stacking the audio output from these varied instruments, keyboardists and musical arrangers attempted to approximate the rich textures and densities of a real <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/802\">orchestra</a> simply by linking and overlapping sound modules together. This was made possible by a technology, then emerging, called Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI). The process to manipulate multiple sounds in the studio from a common point (most often, a keyboard &ldquo;controller&rdquo;) caused MIDI&rsquo;s popularity to soar. Musical elements like tempo, vibrato, dynamics, tuning, and quantization became standard parameters of modern audio design, manipulated by knobs, sliders, levers, and buttons that memorized entire performances. MIDI also brought music sequencers into the recording mainstream that assimilated streams of hardware devices and application products to record, edit, and play back pop music as it has not been previously realized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The disadvantage was that sequencers effectively disenfranchised numerous studio session musicians from studio work, including violinists, violists, cellists, and brass ensemble players. There was an exodus of traditional musicians to jobs in other environments such as cruise ships and overseas hotels. Sequencers also became virtual recording studios by themselves, despite elements missing that could not be replicated such as vocals, guitars, and saxophone solos. Despite their detrimental impact, sequencers became hugely popular in the Philippines, dominating the character of pop music in the 1980s. Among the most illustrious of Manila&rsquo;s sequencer-based arrangers were Willy Cruz, Dante Trinidad, Homer Flores, Gerry Paraiso, and Sunny Ilacad. The technology allowed producers to book recording studios with practically half of the arrangements already pre-recorded, hence at only half the regular expense. Soon, the commercial appeal of sequencer methods in the Philippine recording industry pushed record producers, arrangers, and even aspiring recording artists to follow suit. Anyone, even those with little or no skill to read or write musical notation, became quickly empowered songwriters and MIDI orchestrators on sequencer booms. Soon the technology became pervasive that DIY (Do It Yourself) home recording studios spread far and wide in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1990s, numerous recording studios began utilizing Pro Tools, a hardware-software combination in the Apple Mac computer that simulated traditional analog recording processes in a digital environment. Subsequently, a slew of Windows-based DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) platforms also became prevalent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Much progress has been achieved in studio recording: from the restrictive mono, to the 2, 4, 8, 16, and even 24-track capacity, which allows the recording of as many instruments or voices. Multitrack recorders in the United States can go up to 72 tracks. The multitrack or multihead recording gives the arranger free rein in putting emphasis or in downplaying a particular sound from among the tracks in use. The piano, for example, can be highlighted, while the guitars, drums, and other instruments can be muffled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1970s, digital recording started to replace analogue recording. Analogue recording has to cope with a whole range of levels and frequencies. Digital recording improves on the analogue by describing sound using binary numbers, such that the tape recorder need only to distinguish between two conditions&mdash;the presence or the absence of a pulse. In the 1980s, digital recording technology was already being applied to multitrack studio recorders. The final combination of sounds is cut into the master disc from which commercial pressing will be made. The disc, a thin aluminum plate coated with plastic lacquer, has a surface that is cut by a helium-cooled stylus driven by a spiral form from a special tape machine. The disc-cutting lathe is a high-precision machine tool, and is fully automated. It controls the movement of the lathe so that grooves containing loud passages in the music are cut wider than those on soft passages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In duplication, stampers are fitted to the pattern of hydraulic power which automatically puts labels on both sides and presses the plastic into the shape of the record at a pressure of 1,000 kilograms per square meters and at a temperature of 100 degrees centigrade. After the record is formed, it is mechanically removed from the press, trimmed, slipped into an inner sleeve which is then slipped into an outer sleeve. The process takes 25 seconds for a long-playing (LP) record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A parallel operation is the high-speed duplication of music cassettes and cartridges. A master tape in the loop form replays continuously, feeding the program to the banks of slave recorders each loaded with &ldquo;pancakes&rdquo; (coils) of tapes 2,450 meters long. Both A and B titles are recorded on any one pass. Completely recorded pancakes are loaded into a machine which cuts the tapes, loads them into cassettes, and applies the label. The process takes 4.5 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the advent of PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) digital recording and the development of compact disc (CD) format by Philips and Sony, the compact disc has become the fastest growing medium for the dissemination of prerecorded music. From the late 1980s to the present, sales of CDs now account for at least 10 percent of total sales of all prerecorded music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the music is recorded, visual artists, photographers, and printers collaborate to give the music a &ldquo;face,&rdquo; through appropriate and appealing graphic design on the album jacket or compact disc and cassette case. Since singers are an important selling point, their portrait usually graces the jacket or case. That portrait, however, as well as other elements of design such as color, letter types, and lines should be handled such that they reflect the kind of music the record contains. Soft, even romantic, images are usually associated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballads</a>, while experimental and innovative visuals are deemed perfect for heavy metal rock and new wave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For promotion purposes, the first several hundred copies of the packaged record are distributed to most radio and TV stations and to some entertainment writers and reviewers. To boost record sales, the promotion strategy usually requires the artist to plug his or her album on radio stations in the country, which now number over 300, stage free mini-concerts in shopping malls, run provincial tours, and have scheduled appearances on TV variety shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1970s, the production of a single cost between 1,500 to 2,500 pesos while an LP was from 20,000 to 30,000 pesos. A decade later, it went up to 10,000 to 15,000, and 80,000 pesos to 150,000 pesos, respectively. To date, the cost runs between 250,000 to 300,000 pesos for a respectable LP record of 10 songs. This amount excludes advertising and promotion costs, which could sometimes cost as much as production. That is why most recording companies do not release singles anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The origin of commercial audio recordings in the Philippines could be traced back to the early 20th century. The first ever recording of Filipino music was done in 1906 in Louisiana, USA by musicologist Frances Densmore. Used in the recording were the indigenous instruments that were on display in the United States at that time. The said record and instruments were later donated to the Smithsonian Institute Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Decades earlier, French inventors &Eacute;douard-L&eacute;on Scott de Martinville described ways to inscribe sounds with a phonautograph pen in 1857, and &Eacute;mile-Hortensius-Charles Cros, in 1877, discovered a process called photoengraving that etched the inscription into a groove. A playback device called the phonograph<b> </b>was patented a year later by the American entrepreneur Thomas Edison. This machine had a stylus that ran through the groove, sending the inscription through a diaphragm and back into the air as sound. Records were originally sold as prerecorded wax cylinders, containing songs, instrumental music, or spoken word. The early phonograph cylinders were difficult to mass-produce until the arrival of the gramophone. Invented by the German-born American Emile Berliner in 1887, it utilized flat horizontal disks as the recording medium. Berliner supposedly worked with the businessman Elridge Johnson in founding the Victor Talking Machine Company, but the disruptive association concluded in Berliner&rsquo;s defection to start his own Deutsche Grammophon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Upon the official conclusion of the Philippine-American War in 1902, the Victor Talking Machine Company began selling phonographs in the fledgling American colony. Victor Records conducted the first series of recording sessions in the country, hoping to enhance and eventually cash in on the country&rsquo;s rich musical tradition. The Erlanger &amp; Galinger group scouted for local composers, singers, and musicians and within the year launched and popularized many of its discoveries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sometime before 1913, Major Anderson set up an audio production facility for Victor Records on the second floor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, most likely utilizing a mechanical recording process described as &ldquo;direct-to-disc.&rdquo; Performers gathered around a large acoustic horn while vibrations from its diaphragm guided a cutting lathe, etching the sound as a modulated groove onto the surface of a wax master disk. This master disk was sent to a processing plant in the United States where it was electroplated to create a negative metal stamper used to mold durable replicas of the recording. The discography of American historical recordings in the University of California Santa Barbara lists seven musical compositions by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\">Jose Estella</a> which were recorded from Jun 1912 to Oct 1914. These include &ldquo;La Tagala&rdquo; (The Tagalog Lady), &ldquo;Mi Valse So&ntilde;ado&rdquo; (My Dream Waltz), &ldquo;Piling,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Manila Carnival Rag.&rdquo; These were works performed by brass bands, whose members were some of the first studio session musicians in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the earliest Victor talents was <strong>sarsuwela</strong> star <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2818\">Maria Carpena</a>, who did solos and duets with famous tenor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3931\">Victorino Carrion</a>. Her best pieces were &ldquo;Ang mga Ibon&rdquo; (The Birds) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/943\">&ldquo;Ang Maya&rdquo;</a> (The Sparrow), both Tagalog waltzes by composer Jose Estella, and &ldquo;Ang Geisha&rdquo; (The Geisha) from the sarsuwela <b><i>La Venta de Filipinas al Japon</i></b> (The Sale of the Philippines to Japan). Other recording artists were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3276\">Patrocinio Tagaroma</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2823\">Jose Carvajal</a>, who did songs from Spanish zarzuelas; and Socorro Basilio, Isabel Quintana, Sor F. Geronimo, Hilaria Alvarez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a>, and Amado Infante, who performed songs from the sarsuwela. The Molina Orchestra was the most sought-after session musicians at that time. There are extant ledgers from the RCA-Victor in America of seminal electrical recordings in later years by pioneer Philippine recording artists such as vocalists Natividad &ldquo;Tinay&rdquo; Arellano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a>, who was the acknowledged &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">Jazz</a> Queen&rdquo; of her time, Pacita de Tavera, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2763\">Florentino Ballecer</a>; songwriter-composers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a>; and spoken word performers such as Joaquin Gabino and Mercedes Nonato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The subsequent invention of the microphone, a transducer or sensor that converted sound vibrations into electrical impulses, was a breakthrough that jumpstarted electrical recording, which, together with the sound amplifier, made mechanical recording methods obsolete in 1925. By 1933, acoustic recording was completely disused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later on, sound recording activities became indispensable to the emerging Philippine motion picture industry. The era&rsquo;s most commercially viable talkies (i.e., sound pictures) debuted in local entertainment upon the arrival of <b><i>Syncopation</i></b>, 1929, an American musical film that utilized RCA&rsquo;s photophone sound-on-film process, which premiered in 1930 at the Radio Theater located in Plaza Santa Cruz, Manila. Soon after, the film <b><i>Ang Aswang</i></b> (The Vampire), produced by George Musser and sound engineered by the audiographer William Smith at the Manila Talkatone Studio in Pandacan, was unveiled as the first talking film in the Philippines. It was simultaneously screened in Jan 1933 in the Tivoli Theater in Plaza Santa Cruz and the Lyric Theater in Manila&rsquo;s fashionable Escolta Street. Competition must have been fierce, as only two months after, in early Mar 1933, the movie by the pioneering director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>, <b><i>Punyal na Guinto</i></b> (Golden Dagger), was screened at the Lyric Theater as the country&rsquo;s first complete sound film, integrating dialogue and background music. The advent of movie talkies proved to be a new goldmine for music enthusiasts. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/916\"><strong>Kundiman</strong></a></strong>, jazz, ballad, and <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\">bodabil</a> </i>ditties virtually became the soundtrack of the Filipino way of life. These years of frenzied creation saw the growing competition between the pioneer Victor Records and the emerging Columbia and Odeon Companies, as radio stations <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\">KZIB</a>, KZRM, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4867\">KZEG</a> tried to outdo each other in hiring Filipino artists and technicians. Remarkable was the volume of musical compositions registered for copyright at the National Library, particularly in 1929.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Local vocalists and instrumentalists who mostly came from the bodabil stage cut records which gave them a name both here and abroad. Among those whose records earned praise in the United States, Europe, Mexico, and South America were Natividad Arellano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3991\">Jovita Fuentes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4078\">Mercedes Matias</a>, Vicente Ocampo, Dionisia Castro, Honorata &ldquo;Atang&rdquo; de la Rama who was hailed as the &ldquo;Queen of Kundiman and the Sarsuwela,&rdquo; and Katy de la Cruz. Because of the popularity of declaimed poetry, the poems of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a> and Florentino Collantes as well as the <i>balagtasan</i> between these two giants were also recorded. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4176\">Bernabe Solis</a> became the first Filipino record producer in 1926. His debut project, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> repertoire by Arellano, had to be recorded in the United States, for lack of proper equipment in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the importation of advanced equipment after World War II, enterprising singer and band leader <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4045\">Cecil Lloyd</a> and his friends set up the first Filipino-owned recording company in April 1948. The Philippine Recording System, under the labels Bataan and Molave, offered the public a version of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\">&ldquo;Bahay Kubo&rdquo;</a> (Nipa Hut) and other popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1553\">folk songs</a> arranged to rhumba rhythm. These innovations were, however, considered distasteful by the conservative audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many names of the movie sound department personnel during this era would have been lost if not for the rosters of the annual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> awards that began in 1952. Charles Gray (Lebran Productions), Angelo Larraga (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a>), July P. Hidalgo (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a>), Demetrio de Santos (Premiere Productions), Joseph Straight (Sampaguita Pictures), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4632\">Luis Reyes</a> (LVN Pictures), Flaviano Villareal (Sampaguita Pictures), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4338\">Juanito Clemente</a> (Nepomuceno Productions), Ben Patajo (LVN Pictures), and Enrique Bautista (LVN Pictures) were cited as the leading sound-on-film engineers during the Philippine movie industry&rsquo;s Golden Age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Much of the music that became popular before and after the World War II was American popular songs. Struggling against the overwhelming trend of American pop songs in radio, film, and recording was <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\">Villar Records</a>, which specialized in the recording and dissemination of Filipino song forms. Villar Records, an independent Philippine record label specializing in folk music and popular songs using traditional forms, was launched by Manuel P. Villar in 1950. Lauded in later years as the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Recording,&rdquo; Villar produced songs by contemporary kundiman masters such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3958\">Constancio de Guzman</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3934\">Levi Celerio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\">Leopoldo Silos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\">Mike Velarde</a>, committing their works to posterity. He became the founding president of the Record Industry Association of the Philippines (RIAP), the precursor of the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI). Villar Records itself belonged to a larger conglomerate that included an extensive radio network and recording facility whose sound engineer, Cesar Armario, was responsible for countless recordings of classic Philippine songs. The pioneering efforts of Villar Records became mainstream after the 1970s, when Pinoy pop music grew in leaps and bounds, specially because of the Metro Manila Popular Music Festival (Metropop) and the government order requiring that <strong>original Pilipino music</strong> (OPM) be played by all radio stations at regular intervals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other recording companies which produced OPM music in the last two decades are Wea (now Universal) Records, Vicor Music Corporation, OctoArts International, Dyna-ENU Records, BMG-Pilipinas, Viva Records, Alpha Records, Ivory Records, Platinum Records, Grandeur Records, Praise Records, Jem Records, A&amp;W Records, GOI Records, Valley Records, Concorde Productions, Audio Music Corporation, Backbeat Music, Exotica Records, Golden Music Arts, Hitwave Marketing, Love Records and Tapes, JR Records and Tapes, Philharmonic Records, Richtone Corporation, Sound Publishing, Striker Records and Tapes, Telesis Recording and Entertainment Corp, VNM Productions, and A&amp;B Recording.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were recording studios in the country such as Greenhills Sound Production, Audio Captain Productions, Cinema Audio, JR Recording Studio, Studio Twenty-Two, Abbey Road Recording Studio, PM Recording Studio, and Richtone Studios. The vast Sampaguita Pictures compound in San Juan, Rizal operated a recording studio that serviced not only their internal sound stage requirements but also record companies that desired the live sound of their spacious recording room. The expertise of audio engineers such as Jess Payumo, Jun Orenza, Dante San Pedro, and Monching Payumo were sought by record company clients for their award winning circa-1970s mixes as disparate as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/901\">&ldquo;Ang Himig Natin&rdquo;</a> (Our Music) by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4025\">Juan de La Cruz Band</a> and the jazz orchestra album of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4086\">Lito Molina</a> &amp; The Jazz Friends. When Sampaguita Pictures closed their doors in the 1980s, their engineers migrated to a nearby facility in San Juan City that was just as expansive and had good acoustics&mdash;the Green Hill Recording Studio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Responding to a soaring demand for professionally recorded musical films during the mid- to late 1960s boom, the actor Jose Mari Gonzales opened his own Cinema-Audio Recording Studios that largely defined the sound of classic OPM at the turn of the decade. The sound engineering team headed by Dindo Aldecoa, along with Ric Santos and Boy Roxas, was responsible for the rise of such recording stars as Sharon Cuneta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4040\">Kuh Ledesma</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3857\">Freddie Aguilar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\">APO&nbsp;Hiking Society</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\">Basil Valdez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tasha Recording Studio located in Libis, Quezon City, was built in the early-1980s by an expatriate American singer, Morris Albert, who employed the sound engineer, Edwin Luna. Together, they created a unique OPM sound characterized by automated reverberation effects and panoramic sound imaging that helped create the hits of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\">Martin Nievera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\">Zsa Zsa Padilla</a>, and Gary Valenciano. The comedian and politician Tito Sotto purchased the studio later in 1986, and commercial bookings continued until a tragic fire accident gutted the edifice. The setback was devastating to the OPM scene, if not symbolic of the changing times ahead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For music produced from synthesizers, the final production needed the technical proficiency that can only be possible through mastering the final product in a recording studios. When expertise was required, boutique studios went into vogue such as the specialized Sweet Spot Solutions studio in Pasig City owned by the electronica music mavens Malek Lopez and the Hong Kong British expatriate Noel de Brackinghe; the more elaborate Tower of Doom studio in Quezon City servicing the heavy metal genre, operated by rock producer Eric Perlas; the Acoustic Underground in Quezon City, operated by Aji Manalo; and Sound Weavers, the recording studio in Makati City geared for the blues music community, operated by Gerry Diwa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were elaborately priced all-digital commercial enclaves typified by the award-winning Hit Productions in Makati City, owned by the songwriter expatriate Salito Malca and staffed by musician-engineers such as the siblings Angelo Villegas and Mike Villegas. But there were studios, too, that have become &ldquo;indie remedies,&rdquo; that is, those that bridged gear-deficient home recording studios and pricey enclaves but were popularly priced. One such Pro Tools studio was Sound Creation Studio, a facility with an elaborate acoustical room infrastructure run by the Filipino sound engineer Hazel Pascua and its owner, the expatriate Japanese musician-engineer Shinji Tanaka.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Youth bands playing real guitars and drums had a huge impact in pushing music recording into the digital age. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\">Eraserheads</a> and their producer Robin Rivera infused creativity into the multi-track magnetic tape environment of Jun Regalado&rsquo;s JR Studio in Makati to shape their multi-platinum albums, <b><i>Circus</i></b>, 1994, and <b><i>Cutterpillow</i></b>, 1995, with the sound engineer, Lito Palco. Across the metropolis, in Pasig City, the studio named TRACKAcoustics/Studios, owned by the acoustic designer, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4922\">Mike Pedero</a>, and engineered by Angee Rozul had been making headway recording the world-folk album, <b><i>Rippingyarns</i></b>, 2000, by singer-songwriter Cynthia Alexander. Recording engineers and mixers are a prolific lot in the industry and have earned recognition from their peers. Some of those who have devoted many years to perfecting musical technology are Egay Guerrero, Lito Balagtas, Willy Munji, Dindo Aldecoa, Jess and Monching Payumo, Dante San Pedro, Jun Orense, Edwin Borja, Boy Roxas, Edwin Luna, Bobby Bagayava, Jaime Godinez, Joseph Roxas, and Voltaire Olpiano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The long process of birthing a new record and the technological developments in sound recording all happen away from the spotlight, but these have certainly helped these performers&rsquo; rise in popularity: in the 1950s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4875\">Sylvia La Torre</a>, Bobby Gonzales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\">Ruben Tagalog</a>, Ric Manrique Jr, the Mabuhay Singers, and later Diomedes Maturan; in the 1960s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3943\">Pilita Corrales</a>, Carmen Soriano, Carmen Pate&ntilde;a, Mercy Molina, and later, Helen Gamboa, Jeanne Young, Wing Duo, Reycard Duet, Tiongco Brothers, Pauline Sevilla, Eddie Peregrina, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4277\">Nora Aunor</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a>, and Edgar Mortiz; in the 1970s, Juan de la Cruz Band, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4012\">Hotdog</a>, Lerma de la Cruz, Mike Hanopol, and later, the New Minstrels, Something Special, Circus Band, APO HikingSociety, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4041\">Celeste Legaspi</a>, Leah Navarro, Tillie Moreno, Aloha (now Ali Sotto), Coritha, Jacqui Magno, Lirio Vital, Susana Pichay, Cynthia Garcia, Maricris Bermont, Ray-an Fuentes, Basil Valdez, Rico J.

Recordings channeled through synthesizers achieve the desired balance of sounds through the preprogrammed tracking assignments. An obvious drawback of a total dependence on synthesizers, however, is that it can dehumanize the recording session or render it mechanical and predictable. It can replace the human fingers on the <a href=\"/5/37/822\">piano</a> or <a href=\"/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, and can mask or eliminate a singer&#x2019;s faltering notes, giving a wrong impression of the singer&#x2019;s abilities."

By stacking the audio output from these varied instruments, keyboardists and musical arrangers attempted to approximate the rich textures and densities of a real <a href=\"/5/36/802\">orchestra</a> simply by linking and overlapping sound modules together. This was made possible by a technology, then emerging, called Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI). The process to manipulate multiple sounds in the studio from a common point (most often, a keyboard &#x201C;controller&#x201D;) caused MIDI&#x2019;s popularity to soar. Musical elements like tempo, vibrato, dynamics, tuning, and quantization became standard parameters of modern audio design, manipulated by knobs, sliders, levers, and buttons that memorized entire performances. MIDI also brought music sequencers into the recording mainstream that assimilated streams of hardware devices and application products to record, edit, and play back pop music as it has not been previously realized."

There was an exodus of traditional musicians to jobs in other environments such as cruise ships and overseas hotels. Sequencers also became virtual recording studios by themselves, despite elements missing that could not be replicated such as vocals, guitars, and saxophone solos. Despite their detrimental impact, sequencers became hugely popular in the Philippines, dominating the character of pop music in the 1980s. Among the most illustrious of Manila&#x2019;s sequencer-based arrangers were Willy Cruz, Dante Trinidad, Homer Flores, Gerry Paraiso, and Sunny Ilacad. The technology allowed producers to book recording studios with practically half of the arrangements already pre-recorded, hence at only half the regular expense. Soon, the commercial appeal of sequencer methods in the Philippine recording industry pushed record producers, arrangers, and even aspiring recording artists to follow suit. Anyone, even those with little or no skill to read or write musical notation, became quickly empowered songwriters and MIDI orchestrators on sequencer booms. Soon the technology became pervasive that DIY (Do It Yourself) home recording studios spread far and wide in Manila."

In the 1980s, digital recording technology was already being applied to multitrack studio recorders. The final combination of sounds is cut into the master disc from which commercial pressing will be made. The disc, a thin aluminum plate coated with plastic lacquer, has a surface that is cut by a helium-cooled stylus driven by a spiral form from a special tape machine. The disc-cutting lathe is a high-precision machine tool, and is fully automated. It controls the movement of the lathe so that grooves containing loud passages in the music are cut wider than those on soft passages."

This machine had a stylus that ran through the groove, sending the inscription through a diaphragm and back into the air as sound. Records were originally sold as prerecorded wax cylinders, containing songs, instrumental music, or spoken word. The early phonograph cylinders were difficult to mass-produce until the arrival of the gramophone. Invented by the German-born American Emile Berliner in 1887, it utilized flat horizontal disks as the recording medium.

Around 10 percent of the Philippine population plays indigenous music during religious <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> and feasts, and in secular activities, while the remaining percent performs using instruments that are mostly Western in origin.

This article focuses on makers of Western instruments in the Philippines, particularly stringed instrument makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The migration of craftsmen, including makers of musical instruments, from Mexico to the Philippines happened during the transpacific galleon trade in the 16th century. These Mexican luthiers spread across the Philippines and became responsible for the arrival of many types of stringed instruments in the islands. Unfortunately, records did not mention specific names of early luthiers who built stringed instruments in the country until the late 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pedro Buencamino was the earliest stringed instrument maker<b> </b>and repairer on record. He was born on 1 Aug 1866 in Abukay, Bataan. Buencamino never finished his schooling and became a circus performer at thirteen years old. He toured around the country as part of the circus, from which he learned to play the guitar. After ten years of performing in the circus, Buencamino decided to retire and settled in Manila, then later on began repairing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitars</a> in his house at Isaac Peral Street. It is believed that he acquired his skill from his frequent visits to repair shops in Ongpin Street, Manila. During the revolution in 1896, he and his wife Petra Martin evacuated to San Fernando, Pampanga where they established a music store cum barber shop. After three years, the couple decided to go back to Manila. Later on, Buencamino was awarded a medal in 1904 when he exhibited his stringed instruments at the Philippine Exposition. He established the music store El Sol Mayor in 1916. This store, located in Rizal Avenue, Santa Cruz, Manila, he maintained until his death in 1923.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from guitars, Buencamino also manufactured <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violins</a>, violoncellos, and basses. Moreover, Buencamino, together with another luthier named Andres, operated another guitar factory in San Miguel District in Manila. To commemorate the existence of the factory in that neighborhood, the district&rsquo;s bridge was named Puente Guitarrero or Guitarist&rsquo;s Bridge. Buencamino used local woods for his guitars like narra, <i>laniti, </i>and <i>langka </i>for the backs and sides; <i>palochina </i>or white pine for the top; and <i>kamagong </i>for the fingerboard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Buencamino&rsquo;s former workers, namely Fausto Martin and Alejandro de la Rosa, continued the tradition of stringed instrument making in the country. Martin became an expert violin and cello repairman. He was known because of the recommendation of famous musicians during the time such as Ramon Corpus, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\">Bonifacio Abdon</a>, Alejandro Arellano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4216\">Ernesto Vallejo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\">Antonio Molina</a>, who lauded his ability to improve the appearance as well as the tonality of the instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, de la Rosa opened a violin repair shop in Tondo, Manila. His specialization in enhancing and refining the tonal features of the violin earned him the title &ldquo;Hari&rdquo; or &ldquo;King of Filipino Repairmen.&rdquo; Alejandro de la Rosa was made famous by foreign violin virtuosi who visited the country, as these violinists like Cecilia Hanson and Piastro were impressed with his work when they asked him to restore their Stradivarius violins. Because of his exceptional ability, these foreigners recommended him to others after going back to their countries. As a result, de la Rosa was highly regarded not only in the Philippines but also in other countries&mdash;he even got offers from repair shops in the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and Russia to supervise their manufacturing and repairing of violins, but he decided to stay in the country. Besides violin repairing and manufacturing, de la Rosa was also a famous guitar maker. He started making toy guitars from coconut shells before the age of ten, and before he was twenty, the guitars he made became very popular in the cities and provinces of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Innovation and experimentation were also seen in the early part of the history of Filipino stringed instrument makers. One of those who dared was Casto Maria de Nieva. He was born 1 Jul 1873 in Boac, Marinduque. In 1882, de Nieva went to Manila and studied at the Ateneo de Manila then finished his bachelor of arts degree at the University of Santo Tomas in 1894. He was known for being innovative as he made his own repairing and manufacturing tools. He also experimented on the use of a wood in 1925, as he made a special violin using one wood, the laniti, for the top, back and sides, neck, and scroll. It had been said that to produce a good sound, the violin&rsquo;s body should not be made of a single kind of wood. But, de Nieva&rsquo;s experiment proved to be successful, as observed by the former National Library Director Epifanio de los Santos. He also built cellos or violoncellos, based on the paper labels of his instruments which said &ldquo;Casto Nieva, Constructor de Violines y Violoncellos, Manila, Islas Filipinas.&rdquo;<i> </i>He died on 21 May 1935, leaving behind violins which were products of his creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another expert violin repairman was Domingo Pesigan, born in Calamba, Laguna on 24 Jul 1906 and recognized during the early part of the 20th century. He became a worker of well-known violinmaker Alejandro de la Rosa, but later, after honing his skills, he established his own music shop in Manila. He also explored the use of Philippine woods like <i>laniti</i>, <i>pino</i>, and kamagong<i>.</i> Among his customers and patrons who kept his shop busy and thriving were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4194\">Ramon Tapales</a>, Servilla Castillejos, Pablo Palomo, Manuel Bautista, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4063\">Basilio Manalo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1911, a shop named Compositor de Instrumentos de Cuerda was established by Eusebio Cabilu&ntilde;a. Cabilu&ntilde;a was a famous repairman of wind and percussion instruments as well as a maker of guitars, banjos, ukuleles, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/803\">rondalla</a>. Cabilu&ntilde;a supplied instruments to Cebu&rsquo;s rondalla group La Juventud Filipina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the most significant guitar makers in the Philippines during the second half of the 1900s was Michael Romero. A native of Baliangao, Misamis Occidental, Romero used to be a customs officer in Manila during the 1960s. He started to become curious about why imported classical guitars passing through their office were always being declared of high value. He started researching on the materials and process used for making classical guitar. He bought books and tools on making quality classical guitars. In 1969, Romero started building quality guitars in his house in Magallanes Village, Makati City. On 19 Apr 1970, he decided to commercially open a guitar store and shop in Mercedes Street, Pinagkaisahan, Makati City. He named his shop Guitarmasters. He recruited guitar makers from the Visayas to become his workers. The number one luthier in the shop was Flavio Bilbao from the province of Bohol. In addition, Romero also hired guitar luthiers from Cebu province such as Demetrio Aying, Nardo Ompad, and Alex Ompad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Guitarmasters was considered one of the first to make high quality guitars in Metro Manila. The shop used imported quality woods like spruce and rosewood to be able to build good-sounding guitars. It also experimented in using local woods such as langka for the top and <i>ipil</i> for the back and sides. During the 1970s, the shop also became the favorite hangout place of classical guitarists Jose Valdez, Raul Manikan, and Mario Rodriguez. Aside from making and selling guitars, the shop also offered guitar lessons to aspiring students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another achievement of Guitarmasters was that it provided quality instruments to concert guitarists during this time when guitar concertizing in the country was only beginning. The elite classical guitarists helped in promoting Guitarmasters by using its guitars during concerts and recommending them to their students, friends, and guitar aficionados. Romero also made a ten-string guitar exclusively for Jose Valdez in 1973. On 14 Dec of the same year, Valdez held a concert at the Philamlife Auditorium using the Imelda Model, a specially made guitar by Guitarmasters inspired by then-First Lady Imelda Marcos&rsquo;s efforts to revive music in the country. Guitarmasters flourished from 1970 to 1983. Because of unfortunate events in the family of the owner, Guitarmasters experienced financial instability and closed down in the latter part of the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tradition of stringed instrument making in the country developed with the help and contributions of the luthiers in the latter part of the 20th century. Some of these are guitar makers Dominguez Javier, Mario Rodriguez, Raul Manikan; and bowed instrument makers Amador Tamayo (violin/viola/cello), Angel Gabute (violin/double bass), and Efren Tapao, Dante Gabute, Romeo Gabute, and Bening Abarrientos (double bass). Most of them are still producing quality instruments until today, supplying instruments to concert artists and music students from different schools in Manila and in the provinces, including international classical performers. Aside from these individual makers, big shops with lots of instrument makers are still flourishing in the country today like in Raon, Quiapo, and Santa Mesa in Manila, in Guagua, Pampanga, and in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most significant guitar maker in the 21st century is Cebu native Armando Derecho aka Tabo. He is considered one of the best Filipino classical guitar makers who just officially started to market his guitar recently. In 1982, Derecho enrolled in University of the Philippines College of Music as a guitar major. He is one of the original members of the UP Guitar Ensemble that toured in Australia during the 1980s. Derecho also became a guitarist of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4204\">UP Concert Chorus</a> and the UP Filipiniana Dance Troupe in the late 80s to the early 90s. After hearing good quality classical guitars in UP, specifically his professor&rsquo;s imported guitar, Derecho asked himself why Cebuanos could not make that kind of guitar. Derecho challenged himself and started learning how to build guitars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Derecho had formal studies on guitar making with Mario Rodriguez, a guitar maker and a teacher at the UST Conservatory of Music. He went to Rodriguez&rsquo;s house in Cainta almost every day for more than two years to observe and try building guitars under the supervision of his teacher. In the late 1990s, Rodriguez left the country for the United States, and this was the time when Derecho tried making his own guitars. Rodriguez gave him a second hand mold and some guitar making books to start his guitar making hobby. During that time, he was a full-time performer in hotels and restaurants in Metro Manila. Derecho constructed his guitars in his boarding house during his free time before going to his gigs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Derecho, together with his wife, decided to move to Marikina City in 1999. In April of the same year, he rented a lot behind his backyard and turned it into a guitar shop, which he later transferred beside his house. Nardo Ompad, a former worker in Guitarmasters, met Derecho and applied to be his assistant. To this date, Ompad still works at Derecho&rsquo;s shop in Marikina. Derecho guitars use high quality imported materials such as spruce, cedar, rosewood, and pine. Since 1999, Derecho has built more than 100 guitars. Derecho guitars became very significant during the early 2000s because they gave classical guitar players access to locally made quality guitars. These guitars are as good as the imported ones but come with a lower tag price. He is presently one of the Filipino guitar makers, if not the only one, in the country who can make classical guitars that can match the quality of imported concert model guitars.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Nathan Neil V.

He went to Rodriguez&#x2019;s house in Cainta almost every day for more than two years to observe and try building guitars under the supervision of his teacher. In the late 1990s, Rodriguez left the country for the United States, and this was the time when Derecho tried making his own guitars. Rodriguez gave him a second hand mold and some guitar making books to start his guitar making hobby. During that time, he was a full-time performer in hotels and restaurants in Metro Manila. Derecho constructed his guitars in his boarding house during his free time before going to his gigs."

				"value": "Derecho, together with his wife, decided to move to Marikina City in 1999. In April of the same year, he rented a lot behind his backyard and turned it into a guitar shop, which he later transferred beside his house. Nardo Ompad, a former worker in Guitarmasters, met Derecho and applied to be his assistant. To this date, Ompad still works at Derecho&#x2019;s shop in Marikina. Derecho guitars use high quality imported materials such as spruce, cedar, rosewood, and pine. Since 1999, Derecho has built more than 100 guitars. Derecho guitars became very significant during the early 2000s because they gave classical guitar players access to locally made quality guitars. These guitars are as good as the imported ones but come with a lower tag price. He is presently one of the Filipino guitar makers, if not the only one, in the country who can make classical guitars that can match the quality of imported concert model guitars.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Nathan Neil V.
