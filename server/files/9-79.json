The Manila Sinbun-sya, the cultural arm of the Japanese government in the Philippines, conducted a literary contest to choose the best stories written in Pilipino and published in various magazines. The project was part of the attempt to eradicate Western culture. A panel of evaluators composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5198\">Jose Esperanza Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5287\">A.

They were guided by two principles: the content of the work must reflect the spirit of the Japanese New Order or at least not be contrary to it; and the form or technique must exhibit artistry and craftsmanship. Each of the panelists drew up his list of the top 25 stories. Those stories which had the most number of inclusions made it to the top 10. Six stories were submitted to the government panel, consisting of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5630\">I&ntilde;igo Ed.

Two differing perspectives emerged. The younger panel valued subtlety, restraint, and indirection, whereas the older panel hewed to more traditional qualities in &ldquo;good&rdquo; literature: rhetorical style, sentimentalism, and didacticism.

Tiempo probes into moral issues, the polemics of good and evil, and suggests that there is a human existential purpose in situations that require the graceful weathering of ironies and absurdities. Solitude overwhelms her characters, and they are doomed to loneliness, loss of identity, and wandering. Tiempo uses symbol and suggestion to create a hushed mood in her fiction. Her language is descriptive but unburdened with scrupulous detailing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;The Hound,&rdquo; a town turns to a beggar-woman in the aftermath of war and seeks her mysterious power to cure and to resurrect the dead, while a local politician struggles with the Sisyphean task of restoring the social order. In &ldquo;The Chambers of the Sea,&rdquo; a man learns to accept life&rsquo;s responsibilities when he observes sea creatures going about their task with almost humanlike tenderness. Ultimately, he realizes that all painful wanderings must end with the finding of the self. &ldquo;The Black Monkey&rdquo; exposes the irony of escape, as a woman, convalescing in the mountains and removed from the violence of flatland war, discovers the fatal power of a gun when she is provoked by a monkey invading her hideout. In &ldquo;Abide, Joshua,&rdquo; the title story, the practical demands and the cruelties of time threaten a family&rsquo;s ancestral home, but it is lovingly recalled and remains in the memory of a seamstress. Human pride and generosity endure in the discovery that it is not human possessions nor the attachment to the perishable material of life that matters, but the loving and vivid recollections, during the harshest seasons, of past pleasure or pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tiempo appropriates Western thematics to the local setting, through the influential literary and moral echoes of writers such as Francis Thompson and, more importantly, T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden. As a modern fictionist, Edith L. Tiempo successfully integrates the formal method with psychological realism, to pursue dimensions of consciousness in Philippine fiction in English that are seldom probed, especially in ordinary, middle-class characters and settings. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Danilo Francisco M.

Solitude overwhelms her characters, and they are doomed to loneliness, loss of identity, and wandering. Tiempo uses symbol and suggestion to create a hushed mood in her fiction. Her language is descriptive but unburdened with scrupulous detailing."

In &#x201C;The Chambers of the Sea,&#x201D; a man learns to accept life&#x2019;s responsibilities when he observes sea creatures going about their task with almost humanlike tenderness. Ultimately, he realizes that all painful wanderings must end with the finding of the self. &#x201C;The Black Monkey&#x201D; exposes the irony of escape, as a woman, convalescing in the mountains and removed from the violence of flatland war, discovers the fatal power of a gun when she is provoked by a monkey invading her hideout. In &#x201C;Abide, Joshua,&#x201D; the title story, the practical demands and the cruelties of time threaten a family&#x2019;s ancestral home, but it is lovingly recalled and remains in the memory of a seamstress. Human pride and generosity endure in the discovery that it is not human possessions nor the attachment to the perishable material of life that matters, but the loving and vivid recollections, during the harshest seasons, of past pleasure or pain."

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5131\">Gregorio C. Brillantes</a>. Manila: National Book Store. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4781\">Catholic Mass Media Award of Merit</a> for Best Book, 1981. Included, with four new stories, in <b><i>On a Clear Day in November, Shortly before the Millennium: <strong>Stories</strong> for a Quarter Century</i></b>. Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, Inc, 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Written in the tumultuous decades of the 1960s and the 1970s, the stories in <b><i>The Apollo Centennial</i></b><i> </i>are charged with the same energy, anger, contemplation, and tragedy that gripped Philippine society at the time. A sense of loss and desperation pervades the stories, often followed by equally desperate attempts to overcome it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of the stories situate themselves directly within the sociopolitical conflicts of the time. &ldquo;A Taste for the Fine Wine of Bourgeoisie&rdquo; details the parties of the Bautistas from 1960 to 1975. These parties are described objectively and meticulously, a style that reflects the relative isolation and detachment of the Bautistas from the unrest growing around them. A similar party takes place in &ldquo;Help,&rdquo; where the story of a love affair is sandwiched between a cornucopia of philosophical, scientific, and pseudo-scientific discussions about society. &ldquo;The Mayor of San Felipe&rdquo; is a profile of the authoritarian mayor Frankie Mangrobang, whose simultaneous &ldquo;modernization&rdquo; and oppression of San Felipe echo the work of a historical dictator who shares his initials. Meanwhile, &ldquo;Janis Joplin, the Revolution, and the Melancholy Widow of Diego Silang Street&rdquo; tells of a journalist&rsquo;s desperate attempt to stay centrist amid violence and revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other stories are more philosophical in nature, though not any less critical. The nature of time is a dominant theme in &ldquo;The Cries of Children on an April Afternoon in the Year 1957.&rdquo; In this story, time takes on a mercurial, transitory, and ineluctable quality, oscillating between a languid April afternoon full of carefree cries of the children, and short, silent, unobtrusive scenes of said children&rsquo;s futures, filled with pain and disillusionment. Time is again central in the title story, though in this case it is immutable: in the year 2069, the children of a still underdeveloped, still guerrilla-ridden rural Tarlac come to the city to celebrate the centennial of the American moon landing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;The Quintuplets&rdquo; is another futuristic story, though time is no longer the central issue here. In this story a doctor hurries to save dying quintuplets in a future of widespread birth control and infertility. Then there is the tragicomedy &ldquo;Excerpts from the Autobiography of a Middle-aged Ghost Writer with Insomnia,&rdquo; which explores a brief literary giant&rsquo;s fall from grace and his subsequent (and successful) selling out. Written in a more traditional realist mode, &ldquo;Journey to the Edge of the Sea&rdquo; delves into a World War II veteran&rsquo;s second war against his wife&rsquo;s infidelity. Finally, &ldquo;The Fires of the Sun, the Crystalline Sky, the Dark Ocean, and Some Women and/or Girls, including Napoleon Espiritu&rsquo;s First Granddaughter&rdquo; tells of the disruption in a middle-aged man&rsquo;s life when he sees his past lover in the face of his daughter&rsquo;s friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These 10 stories were later reprinted in <b><i>On a Clear Day in November, Shortly before the Millennium: Stories for a Quarter Century</i></b>, 2000, along with four new works. These new pieces are generally more comedic. In &ldquo;Stranger in an Asian City,&rdquo; Juan Salvador travels to a foreign junta-ruled city that reminds him so much of Manila. &ldquo;A Mission for Heroes&rdquo; pokes fun at historical revisionism with its own top-secret &ldquo;dining-table book,&rdquo; Project Maharlika. &ldquo;The Flood in Tarlac&rdquo; explores the contradictions of property right and inequality among peasants and hacenderos. Finally, the title story takes a turn to the magical real, when the spirits of the dead return to earth for a scheduled visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Brillantes poses various philosophical and social questions in commensurately various forms. Some works follow a more traditional realist route culminating in a Joycean epiphany, while others are set in distant but bleakly familiar futures. Others still rely heavily on fragmentation or some other technique, so that form and content work symbiotically and are impossible to consider separately. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Dominic Sy</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

				"value": "Written in the tumultuous decades of the 1960s and the 1970s, the stories in <b><i>The Apollo Centennial</i></b><i> </i>are charged with the same energy, anger, contemplation, and tragedy that gripped Philippine society at the time. A sense of loss and desperation pervades the stories, often followed by equally desperate attempts to overcome it."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Many of the stories situate themselves directly within the sociopolitical conflicts of the time. &#x201C;A Taste for the Fine Wine of Bourgeoisie&#x201D; details the parties of the Bautistas from 1960 to 1975. These parties are described objectively and meticulously, a style that reflects the relative isolation and detachment of the Bautistas from the unrest growing around them. A similar party takes place in &#x201C;Help,&#x201D; where the story of a love affair is sandwiched between a cornucopia of philosophical, scientific, and pseudo-scientific discussions about society. &#x201C;The Mayor of San Felipe&#x201D; is a profile of the authoritarian mayor Frankie Mangrobang, whose simultaneous &#x201C;modernization&#x201D; and oppression of San Felipe echo the work of a historical dictator who shares his initials. Meanwhile, &#x201C;Janis Joplin, the Revolution, and the Melancholy Widow of Diego Silang Street&#x201D; tells of a journalist&#x2019;s desperate attempt to stay centrist amid violence and revolution."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Other stories are more philosophical in nature, though not any less critical. The nature of time is a dominant theme in &#x201C;The Cries of Children on an April Afternoon in the Year 1957.&#x201D; In this story, time takes on a mercurial, transitory, and ineluctable quality, oscillating between a languid April afternoon full of carefree cries of the children, and short, silent, unobtrusive scenes of said children&#x2019;s futures, filled with pain and disillusionment. Time is again central in the title story, though in this case it is immutable: in the year 2069, the children of a still underdeveloped, still guerrilla-ridden rural Tarlac come to the city to celebrate the centennial of the American moon landing."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "&#x201C;The Quintuplets&#x201D; is another futuristic story, though time is no longer the central issue here. In this story a doctor hurries to save dying quintuplets in a future of widespread birth control and infertility. Then there is the tragicomedy &#x201C;Excerpts from the Autobiography of a Middle-aged Ghost Writer with Insomnia,&#x201D; which explores a brief literary giant&#x2019;s fall from grace and his subsequent (and successful) selling out. Written in a more traditional realist mode, &#x201C;Journey to the Edge of the Sea&#x201D; delves into a World War II veteran&#x2019;s second war against his wife&#x2019;s infidelity. Finally, &#x201C;The Fires of the Sun, the Crystalline Sky, the Dark Ocean, and Some Women and/or Girls, including Napoleon Espiritu&#x2019;s First Granddaughter&#x201D; tells of the disruption in a middle-aged man&#x2019;s life when he sees his past lover in the face of his daughter&#x2019;s friend."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "These 10 stories were later reprinted in <b><i>On a Clear Day in November, Shortly before the Millennium: Stories for a Quarter Century</i></b>, 2000, along with four new works. These new pieces are generally more comedic. In &#x201C;Stranger in an Asian City,&#x201D; Juan Salvador travels to a foreign junta-ruled city that reminds him so much of Manila. &#x201C;A Mission for Heroes&#x201D; pokes fun at historical revisionism with its own top-secret &#x201C;dining-table book,&#x201D; Project Maharlika. &#x201C;The Flood in Tarlac&#x201D; explores the contradictions of property right and inequality among peasants and hacenderos. Finally, the title story takes a turn to the magical real, when the spirits of the dead return to earth for a scheduled visit."

				"value": "Brillantes poses various philosophical and social questions in commensurately various forms. Some works follow a more traditional realist route culminating in a Joycean epiphany, while others are set in distant but bleakly familiar futures. Others still rely heavily on fragmentation or some other technique, so that form and content work symbiotically and are impossible to consider separately. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Dominic Sy</strong> </em>"

Cruz</a>. With an introduction and biographical and critical notes for each story by the editor. Manila: Tahanan Books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As Isagani Cruz mentions in his introduction, it is difficult to come up with an anthology of Filipino short stories in English without excluding stories that might be more representative than some of those in the anthology. Even so, most of the 50 short stories included are by recipients of local or international literary awards, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Palanca</a> and the Southeast Asian Writers Awards. Included are canonical works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5500\">Paz Marquez Benitez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5441\">Paz Latorena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5061\">Manuel Arguilla</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5030\">Estrella Alfon</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5209\">Jose Y. Dalisay</a>. Also included are often overlooked stories of the country&rsquo;s major writers: &ldquo;Pattern&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5352\">Carmen Guerrero Nakpil</a>, &ldquo;Ark&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5517\">Resil Mojares</a>, and &ldquo;Portents&rdquo; by Jessica Zafra. There are also writers and stories that have been seemingly neglected in the academe: &ldquo;Five Snapshots&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5296\">Lina Flor</a>, &ldquo;Yours Faithfully&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3414\">Lydia Villanueva Arguilla</a>, &ldquo;The Boarding House&rdquo; by D. Paolo Dizon, and &ldquo;Lover Boy&rdquo; by Lilia Pablo Amansec.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The best way to appreciate the construction of this anthology and the stories themselves is to read them in the order that they appear in the book, which is chronological. This allows the reader to see not only the era in which each story is located but also the evolution of the English language as used by the Filipino writers. For example, Arguilla&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2020\">&ldquo;How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife&rdquo;</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5541\">Charlson Ong</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;How My Cousin Manuel Brought Home a Wife&rdquo; are about families upended by the sudden appearance of another woman in their lives. In Arguilla&rsquo;s story, the treatment is so subtle that readers may miss its sinister implications. Ong&rsquo;s story, on the other hand, is satirical, and is a more pointed criticism of the narrative situation and what it implies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As Cruz points out in the biographical notes, the reason for these differences goes beyond simple generational gap and, thus, technique. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5686\">Bienvenido Santos</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Day the Dancers Came&rdquo; and Jose Dalisay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oldtimer&rdquo; both tell of the plight of Filipinos living in the United States, but the authors treat the subject matter differently: Santos presents a linear narrative, whereas Dalisay makes use of time lapses. Santos&rsquo;s language seems more formal with long, descriptive sentences, and Spanish words to localize the characters. Dalisay&rsquo;s is snappier, with crisp dialogue, shorter sentences, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> words instead of Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are only two stories from Mindanao writers, a fact which the editor laments. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5409\">Ibrahim Jubaira</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Blue Blood of the Big Astana&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5276\">Mig Alvarez Enriquez</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The White Horse of Alih&rdquo; both depict Muslim characters and their alienation from the rest of Philippine society. In Jubaira&rsquo;s story, a servant narrates the rise and fall of the entire Muslim aristocracy; Enriquez&rsquo;s story depicts the escalating conflict between Muslims and Christians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite their diversity in themes and language use, one common thread running through most of these stories is social protest as theme. Many stories are set in rural areas, where abuses are shown to be perpetrated not only by the government and the landed but also by social structures. This anthology shows how the recurring theme of social protest established itself as a literary tradition, which emerging fictionists, writing in any language in the Philippines, continue to draw on. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by Jose Miguel Arguelles</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Even so, most of the 50 short stories included are by recipients of local or international literary awards, such as the <a href=\"/9/9/5159\">Palanca</a> and the Southeast Asian Writers Awards. Included are canonical works by <a href=\"/9/9/5500\">Paz Marquez Benitez</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5441\">Paz Latorena</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5061\">Manuel Arguilla</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5030\">Estrella Alfon</a>, and <a href=\"/9/9/5209\">Jose Y. Dalisay</a>. Also included are often overlooked stories of the country&#x2019;s major writers: &#x201C;Pattern&#x201D; by <a href=\"/9/9/5352\">Carmen Guerrero Nakpil</a>, &#x201C;Ark&#x201D; by <a href=\"/9/9/5517\">Resil Mojares</a>, and &#x201C;Portents&#x201D; by Jessica Zafra. There are also writers and stories that have been seemingly neglected in the academe: &#x201C;Five Snapshots&#x201D; by <a href=\"/9/9/5296\">Lina Flor</a>, &#x201C;Yours Faithfully&#x201D; by <a href=\"/3/3/3414\">Lydia Villanueva Arguilla</a>, &#x201C;The Boarding House&#x201D; by D. Paolo Dizon, and &#x201C;Lover Boy&#x201D; by Lilia Pablo Amansec."

				"value": "The best way to appreciate the construction of this anthology and the stories themselves is to read them in the order that they appear in the book, which is chronological. This allows the reader to see not only the era in which each story is located but also the evolution of the English language as used by the Filipino writers. For example, Arguilla&#x2019;s <a href=\"/9/79/2020\">&#x201C;How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife&#x201D;</a> and <a href=\"/9/9/5541\">Charlson Ong</a>&#x2019;s &#x201C;How My Cousin Manuel Brought Home a Wife&#x201D; are about families upended by the sudden appearance of another woman in their lives. In Arguilla&#x2019;s story, the treatment is so subtle that readers may miss its sinister implications. Ong&#x2019;s story, on the other hand, is satirical, and is a more pointed criticism of the narrative situation and what it implies."

Santos&#x2019;s language seems more formal with long, descriptive sentences, and Spanish words to localize the characters. Dalisay&#x2019;s is snappier, with crisp dialogue, shorter sentences, and <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> words instead of Spanish."

In Jubaira&#x2019;s story, a servant narrates the rise and fall of the entire Muslim aristocracy; Enriquez&#x2019;s story depicts the escalating conflict between Muslims and Christians."

Many stories are set in rural areas, where abuses are shown to be perpetrated not only by the government and the landed but also by social structures. This anthology shows how the recurring theme of social protest established itself as a literary tradition, which emerging fictionists, writing in any language in the Philippines, continue to draw on. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong> Written by Jose Miguel Arguelles</strong> </em>"

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemheadLIT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Published 2004. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5535\">Wilfrido Nolledo</a>. With an introduction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5466\">Bienvenido L. Lumbera</a>. Manila: UST Publishing House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A posthumous collection of 16 of Nolledo&rsquo;s short stories, <b><i><strong>Cadena de Amor and Other Short <strong>Stories</strong></strong></i></b> includes the classic &ldquo;Rice Wine&rdquo; and lesser-known pieces like &ldquo;Harana&rdquo; (Serenade) and &ldquo;Purists, Hold Your Apocalypse.&rdquo; In his introduction, Bienvenido L. Lumbera notes the recurring presence of &ldquo;the alienated hero whose defense against a hostile universe was aloneness and isolation, his gestures of love hardly understood even by those who loved him.&rdquo; This could well be said of the lovers in these stories&mdash;furious and foolish, full of hope but ultimately beyond hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most prominent of the crises that the characters must face are the social and psychic traumas of war, especially World War II. &ldquo;Rice Wine,&rdquo; Nolledo&rsquo;s masterpiece, details a father&rsquo;s and a daughter&rsquo;s struggles through postwar disillusionment and economic difficulties: the former clinging desperately to his memories of the revolution, the latter prostituting herself secretly so that they can survive. &ldquo;Canticle for Dark Lovers&rdquo; depicts the dysfunctional love affair between a veteran and a widow. &ldquo;Adios, Ossimandas&rdquo; explores the contradictions in the lives of young soldiers&mdash;their heroism and inexperience, their need for love and their march toward death. &ldquo;A Lily in the Sea&rdquo; explores the vanity of a woman, Alma, and the violence and eventual disillusionment of war. &ldquo;Diwata, Where She Walked,&rdquo; set in Manila during the time of the Cambodian civil war, deals with the life of Diwata and her half-Kampuchean son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Class division is another theme in Nolledo&rsquo;s stories. In both &ldquo;Since You Do Not Sell Gardenias&rdquo; and &ldquo;Amor de la Calle,&rdquo; the female narrators live in closed, sophisticated, &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; worlds of the elite, until the men they fall for smash their pretentions. &ldquo;Kayumanggi, Mon Amour&rdquo; tells the story of a public-transport driver being hunted down for a debt, while &ldquo;Harana&rdquo; dramatizes the star-crossed love of the fisherman&rsquo;s son and the hacendero&rsquo;s daughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The title story, &ldquo;Cadena de Amor,&rdquo; is another of Nolledo&rsquo;s masterpieces. It revolves around the attempt of two doctors to save Gayo Labrador, one of the last Spaniards in the Philippines. The motif of a dying Spaniard and the theme of a vanishing Hispanic past appear again in the author&rsquo;s greatest work, the novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1716\"><strong>But for the Lovers</strong></a></i></b>, 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other stories in this collection include &ldquo;In Caress of Beloved Faces,&rdquo; a virtuoso portrait of a wedding night; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t Sing Love Songs, You&rsquo;ll Wake My Mother,&rdquo; a first-person account of some journalists&rsquo; night of debauchery; &ldquo;The Last Caucus,&rdquo; a critique of Philippine politics in the 1960s via a humorous retelling of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Julius Caesar; &ldquo;Maria Conception,&rdquo; a story of first love, brief, erratic, and violent; and &ldquo;Purists, Hold Your Apocalypse,&rdquo; a comedy about the negotiations among a cinematographer, a producer-director, and a semi-delirious bedridden star over an inane script.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Nolledo&rsquo;s works cover a wide range of subjects, it is his use of language above all that is his legacy. The sensuous, dreamlike musicality of his prose dominates many of these works. Where the words and phrases seem almost chaotic, they are in actuality&mdash;like the plots and the characters&mdash;spinning and swirling and spiraling around an invisible point, pulsing at the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Written at different times and at different stages of life, the stories collectively make for an interesting study of the development of Nolledo&rsquo;s style. The poetic heights of &ldquo;Rice Wine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cadena de Amor&rdquo; contrast sharply with the milder, simpler style of &ldquo;Since You Do Not Sell Gardenias&rdquo; or &ldquo;Home to Celia.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Every story in this collection is well crafted and shows a level of ingenuity that remains to be matched in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1544\">Philippine literature in English</a>. Numbering among the most inventive and original stylists of Philippine literature, Nolledo inspired a generation of writers to explore and innovate. With this book, Nolledo should continue to do the same. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Dominic Sy</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5439\">Ernesto Lariosa</a>. Translator, Hope Sabanpan-Yu. Cebu: University of San Carlos Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book collects 10 of Ernesto Lariosa&rsquo;s short stories. A thread binding many of Lariosa&rsquo;s stories is man&rsquo;s complete and utter disregard for nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Bugti&rdquo; (The Exchange), originally published in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a></i></b> in 1997, former friends Ruben and Samuel take two very different paths when a cement plant is built on property unscrupulously purchased from the residents of the town and pollutes the area with its chemical run-offs. This brings about complications that lead to Ruben shooting his old friend in an argument.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The theme of encroachment on nature in the name of progress is seen in &ldquo;Ang Baybayon ni Simon&rdquo; (Simon&rsquo;s Shore). Simon, a young fisherman from the rural town of Salagduong, leaves for higher education in Cebu City. He is aghast at how dirty, noisy, and crime-ridden the metropolis is, but he also experiences the kindness of strangers. He returns to his hometown and is reunited with a long-lost love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Christian-Muslim conflict is explored in &ldquo;Ang Multo&rdquo; (A Haunting), which involves a love triangle, a bag with a bomb, arrests, and an unhappy resolution to the love triangle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Kon Di Na Manugpa ang mga Langgam&rdquo; (When Birds No Longer Come to Roost) is the most symbolic of the stories in <b><i>Crack Shot</i></b>. The topic of political abuse and corruption is interwoven with the issue of ecology.

These introduce the struggles and concerns of gay men, particularly those living in the city, with Cubao as a microcosm. The novella follows high school boys Tom and Butch as they navigate the streets and seedy nightlife of 1980s Cubao. Their sexual awakening and turn to prostitution at the hands of the <i>parlorista</i> (gay beauticians) of the district form a picture of how gay men were perceived back then, as maligned and detestable creatures. The book establishes the many themes that Perez exhausts in his subsequent collections; for instance, the use of a supernatural creature and the insistence of the subject&rsquo;s dual nature can already be gleaned in the short story &ldquo;Taong-Lobo&rdquo; (&ldquo;The Werewolf&rdquo;), a portrait of how a straight-acting closeted gay man sheds off all his inhibitions and &ldquo;preys on&rdquo; other men for sexual gratification when night falls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the short story collection <b><i>Cubao Pagkagat ng Dilim: Mga Kuwentong Kababalaghan</i></b>, the notion of a city underworld and its otherworldly denizens is further expounded. Using creatures from folklore and other supernatural entities, the book is divided into three sections. In the first section, the creatures retain their mythological function by coexisting with and occupying the characters&rsquo; material world: in the story &ldquo;Ang Maligno&rdquo; (The Sentinel), a lady boarder is nightly visited by a supernatural entity who guards at the foot of her window. The stories in the second section make the human characters stand in for the creatures themselves and vice versa, thus playing on their duality. The sisters in &ldquo;Ang mga Manananggal&rdquo; (The Self-Segmenting Ghouls) are models of chastity during the day, but they participate in orgiastic rites at night. In the third section, the creatures double as representation and metaphor: in &ldquo;Ang mga Lamanlupa&rdquo; (Underground Spirits), for example, the dentistry student&rsquo;s alienation and anxiety amid the never-ending grind of the city appear in the form of unexplained events in their city block&mdash;pipes suddenly bursting, garbage strewn all over the street in the morning&mdash;coinciding with the construction of the Aurora underpass; the ones causing the mishaps apparently are the displaced <i>lamanlupa</i> (underworld creatures) whose home was the construction site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Modern&rdquo; anxiety and estrangement in fleeting interpersonal relationships abundant in a city setting are a major theme in <b><i>Cubao Midnight Express: Mga Pusong Nadiskaril sa Mahabang <strong>Riles</strong> ng Pag-ibig</i></b>. As the title suggests, the short stories focus on the different types of love and lovers that seem to emerge and flourish in an urban milieu: a teenage boy who has a special bond with his penis (&ldquo;Kaisplit&rdquo; [Shared]), a murderous rapist who reenacts the murder of his first love (&ldquo;Pamamanhikan&rdquo; [Courtship]), four macho gays who play a board game that turn them into princesses while a call boy waits for the winner (&ldquo;Katalo&rdquo; [Opponent]), two employees who fall for each other in the course of playing a long game of &ldquo;secret Santa&rdquo; (&ldquo;Basted&rdquo; [Busted]).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The city&rsquo;s psyche is mapped out more overtly in <b><i>Eros, Thanatos, Cubao: Mga Piling Katha</i></b>, which may be taken as two books published in one volume back-to-back. The characters in the <b><i>Eros</i></b> half are driven by their life instinct; the ones in <b><i>Thanatos</i></b>, by their death drive. But while there is this apparent demarcation, all the stories accentuate both modalities in accordance to the classical Freudian principle that Perez clearly used as his framework. Both titled &ldquo;Ang Pasko Ay Sumapit&rdquo; (Christmas Is Here), two stories share the plot of a sexually molested young girl (in <b><i>Eros</i></b>) and young boy (in <b><i>Thanatos</i></b>) now living out their adult lives in Cubao. On Christmas Eve, they engage in routine sex, a clear consequence of their disturbed childhood. Len-Len, whose entire house is decorated in pink and stocked with toys for little girls, lets in her family&rsquo;s former driver, houseboy, and gardener. David, a germophobe and suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder, lets in three strange young men, their feet full of grime. The former case ends on a tender note; the latter, brutal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Cubao-Kalaw Kalaw-Cubao: Mga Premyadong Katha</i> </b>consists of poems, one-act plays, and the novel <b><i>Bata, Sinaksak, Sinilid sa Baul</i></b> (Child, Stabbed, Hidden Away in a Trunk), its title echoing a gristly tabloid headline. Weaving through dreams, religious iconography, and psychological concepts, the novel tells the story of three friends and their long dead relatives who were involved in a murder case decades ago: Ike, a seminarian, whose father is a pedophile; Ceasar, whose brother is abducted and killed by Ike&rsquo;s father; and Benny, the adopted son of the policeman who is trying to solve the series of child murders. The novel comes with a supplement, &ldquo;Mga Tala ni Bienvenido Dancel&rdquo; (Bienvenido Dancel&rsquo;s Notes), in which the protagonist Benny lists things to buy, reminders, jokes, and his own musings of the origin of the name &ldquo;Cubao.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In these books, Cubao is a fictive space, existing as a composite of the characters&rsquo; unconscious.

Quezon City, 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Cuentos de Juana</i></b><i> </i>is a series of short stories about mythological creatures, told by Juana, a maidservant, through the author-narrator, who is her seven-year-old charge. It is set in a Negros sugar plantation in 1901.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the first tale, &ldquo;La Doncella Que Vivio Tres Vidas&rdquo; (The Young Maiden Who Lived Three Lives), a <i>tamao</i>, or supernatural being, takes the 16-year-old housemaid Pinang captive in his palace within a tamarind tree. Bucio the cook, Pinang&rsquo;s mother, and Felipe, who is a servant in love with Pinang, attempt to rescue the girl with an incantation but to no avail. Three days later, Bucio cuts the tree trunk with an ax, and Pinang emerges but remains in a state of permanent bewilderment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;El Vaquero del Calatcat&rdquo;<i> </i>(The Cowherd of Calatcat), Blas is the cowherd who dreams of marrying Doric. He raises a calf, Hada, which he plans to give as dowry to Doric&rsquo;s parents. But Roque, a neighbor, stones and cripples Hada, which he has caught eating his rice crops. Vowing to take revenge on Roque, Blas transforms into a <i>tic-tic</i>, a self-segmenting ghoul. Roque&rsquo;s family suffers from a series of misfortunes and deaths. When his one remaining son dies, Roque sets out to kill the tic-tic. He pours salt over the lower half of its body, preventing it from reconnecting with its upper half.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;La Leyenda del Cam&aacute;-Cam&aacute;&rdquo; (The Legend of the Cam&aacute;-Cam&aacute;) is about how a boy became the first <i>cam&aacute;-cam&aacute;</i>, a small and mischievous creature. Ino-Dactu is a 10-year-old prince who sails for Jolo to rescue his parents from the Moros (Muslims). With the help of the heron Mahamut, a host of other animals, and his cousin Hamabul, he defeats the Moros and rescues his mother, although his father has died in captivity. Peace returns to their island. When Ino-Dactu&rsquo;s mother dies, Mahamut uses her magic pearl to turn him into a heron, as he wishes. He transforms instead into a half-man and half-bird&mdash;the first cam&aacute;-cam&aacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Mala Suerte&rdquo; (Bad Luck), Jacinto is a native orphan who has been raised by the wealthy plantation-owning Gaiztegui family. The master&rsquo;s extreme cruelty toward his workers would cause some of them to join the <i>pulajanes</i>, mountain rebels headed by Papa Isio. One night the pulajanes abduct the Gaiztegui men, and Jacinto is sent to ransom them. Several times on his way, he encounters the <i>bagat</i>, a shape-shifter that leads travelers astray. Jacinto never finds his abducted masters and himself disappears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The final story of the book, &ldquo;El Lunuk del Remanso Verde&rdquo; (The Lunuk of the Green Haven), is also about a tamao. The story follows the Arruezos, a Spanish family that settles in Negros. Despite the overseer&rsquo;s warnings, the master orders a giant <i>lunuk </i>(banyan) tree cut because it stunts the sugarcane growing around it. The tamao living inside the tree retaliates and kills the Spanish masters from one generation to the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is more than a collection of folkloric tales about supernatural beings. Rather, these are short stories with complex structures and symbolism carrying multilayered meanings. Moreover, it captures the culture of the people of Negros and, ultimately, that of the Filipino people who, despite having been colonized longer than they have been free, live by an indigenous worldview that bears their sense of cosmic justice and social order. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Diego Abad</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories in this collection were written between the 1940s and the 1990s. Most of the stories are about the experiences of women in various conditions: little girls living in an orphanage surrounded by thick walls in &ldquo;Ang mga Ninya&rdquo; (The Little Girls); a mother with mood swings akin to those of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in &ldquo;Manika&rdquo; (Doll); the obsessively thrifty housewife in &ldquo;Huling Karangyaan&rdquo; (Last Extravagance); and a philanderer&rsquo;s long-suffering wife in &ldquo;Ito Pa Rin ang Dating Daigdig&rdquo; (This Is Still the Old World).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three short stories, written during World War II when she was still in her teens, display the young writer&rsquo;s keen intelligence and the ability to create memorable moments. &ldquo;Unang Tala&rdquo; (First Star) centers on a character&rsquo;s longing to see her brother, who has joined the fight against the Japanese. She finally accepts the permanence of her loss when she searches in vain for a star on a moonless night. &ldquo;Ngumingiting Kabughawan&rdquo; (A Smiling Blue) depicts Seni&rsquo;s anger and barely hidden hatred of her father, who has been remiss in his duty. With a mother almost incapacitated by personal problems and with younger siblings dependent on Seni, a teenager, she feels resentful and oppressed. She gradually realizes, after talking to a close friend, that instead of self-pity and anger, she should try to understand an erring father and find it in her heart never to lose her love for him. In &ldquo;Nakatakda ang mga Panahon&rdquo; (The Seasons Are Appointed), a grandmother avoids a life of boredom and monotony by vicariously enjoying her granddaughter&rsquo;s varied experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is, however, in &ldquo;Damdamin ni Corazon&rdquo; (Corazon&rsquo;s Feelings), written in 1952, that Guzman goes against the usual characterization of women as being passive, totally devoted to their families, and willing to efface their identities in the service of other people. Corazon initially seems to fit the stereotype. An orphan, she has found refuge in a family. She is so grateful that she behaves more like a servant than a foster sister to the couple, Ramon and Anita. Don Miguel, Ramon&rsquo;s uncle, who has come for a visit from Hawaii, finds Corazon&rsquo;s excessive loyalty to be unhealthy. He offers her a position to manage his household in Hawaii. When she accepts the offer, Anita lets her go. Ramon becomes resentful and dispirited, and finally admits that it is Corazon he has been in love with all these years. Corazon admits that her subservience is a displacement of her love for Ramon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other stories similarly portray women who go against the grain. &ldquo;Napapawi ng Panahon&rdquo; (Erased by Time) is a story of three sisters, two of whom have children, while the third, childless and married to a drunkard, has an affair with her young boarder. The passage of time wipes away all traces of betrayal and disillusionment, as the husband accepts the wife&rsquo;s daughter by the other man. &ldquo;Munting Imahen&rdquo; (A Little Image) details an office romance involving Lea, an employee who is never afraid to speak her mind, and the division chief, whose ire she has incurred. In &ldquo;Sumisilip Na ang Ligaya&rdquo; (Joy Is Peeping In), a fun-loving, adventurous, and vain 60-year-old woman brazenly bucks society&rsquo;s expectations of an aging woman&rsquo;s proper behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two stories about Filipino women abroad prove the scope and range of Gloria Villaraza&rsquo;s power as a storyteller. &ldquo;Iba Pa Rin ang Aming Bayan&rdquo; (Our Place Is Still Different) tells of the initial culture shock that an uprooted Filipina experiences, and the transformation of second-generation Filipinos into &ldquo;brown Americans.&rdquo; &ldquo;Dolorosa&rdquo; examines the plight of a 36-year-old female overseas worker who is executed for killing her rapist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All in all, these stories stand out for the range of their subject matter and for their dramatic depiction of the workings of the female psyche. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Quezon City: University of the Philippines College of Arts and Letters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A posthumous collection of 13 short stories by Deogracias A. Rosario, considered the &ldquo;Father of the Tagalog Short Story,&rdquo; the book shows the beginnings of the short story in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> and follows Rosario&rsquo;s writing career, which lasted from 1914 to 1936.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first six stories, written between 1914 and 1926, show the romantic and sentimental moorings of Rosario&rsquo;s short stories. &ldquo;Dahil sa Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Because of Love) depicts the tragic love affair between Federico Rodil, a violinist, and Nena Tekson, a soprano who goes to Boston on a scholarship; similarly, &ldquo;Sa Taginting ng Jazz&rdquo; (The Chime of Jazz) depicts the obsessive and self-destructive love that Pepito Sanchez, a jazz pianist, feels for the practical and ambitious Rita, a vaudeville actress. Ideal love triumphs against all of society&rsquo;s vices in &ldquo;Ang Dalawang Larawan sa May-ari ng Puso Ko&rdquo; (The Two Images of the One Who Owns My Heart), in which Mario, a painter, rediscovers Beatriz, his first and true love, after being away in Rome; and in &ldquo;Ang Babaing Nakadominong Itim&rdquo; (The Woman in the Black Dress), where a mysterious woman guides Walfrido, a philandering husband, back to virtue and to his suffering wife and children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The later seven stories, written between 1928 and 1936, still have love as their theme, but their scope includes critiques of Philippine society and American colonialism. In &ldquo;Greta Garbo,&rdquo; Rosario uses the character of Monina Vargas, who has modeled her looks and her life after Greta Garbo&rsquo;s, to show the pernicious effects of fully embracing a modern way of life. &ldquo;Walang Panginoon&rdquo; (There Is No Lord) is the story of the struggles of Marcos, a farmer, to fight the oppressive landlord Don Teong. In &ldquo;Aloha,&rdquo; love transcends racial divides as Dan Merton, a white American, marries Noemi, a Kanaka or native Hawaiian, despite parental opposition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although some of his stories may be considered too didactic or sentimental today, Rosario introduced psychological depth in his characterization and used innovative techniques that highlight the social and cultural change brought about by American colonialism. The collection is thus an important testament to the early history of the Tagalog short story and Rosario&rsquo;s contribution to its development. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Christopher Mitch Cerda</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Manila: University of Santo Tomas Publishing House.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is a collection of 35 short stories, published between 1927 and 1943, with one story undated, by one of the first Filipino women writers of fiction in English. Kalaw&rsquo;s introduction notes that the stories&rsquo; female protagonists are married women who overcome the difficulties of marriage by their steadfastness. She observes that the faithful wife or mother is rewarded and the &ldquo;erring&rdquo; wife or mother, punished. Her other categories are the &ldquo;woman as martyr&rdquo; and the &ldquo;woman as wife and mother.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories themselves, however, exceed Kalaw&rsquo;s commentary. Latorena avoids making pat judgments, choosing instead to let the reader enter the protagonist&rsquo;s consciousness. In &ldquo;Her Punishment?&rdquo; a financially successful Magdalena returns after 20 years to her impoverished daughter, who rebuffs her. Magdalena wonders if this might be her punishment for her dereliction of duty as a mother, but the interrogative in the title and Magdalena&rsquo;s back story leave the matter open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many of the stories probe the relations between the sexes, in particular, the misunderstandings, innocent or even well-meaning in origin but nonetheless devastating in their effect, between men and women in love. In &ldquo;Desire,&rdquo; which seems to epitomize the stories with this theme, the protagonist is pained to discover that the man she thought would love her &ldquo;for herself&rdquo; and not for her body confesses that it is her body, after all, that he desires. In &ldquo;Her Hopeless Quest,&rdquo; Malaya rejects Dr Arturo when she discovers that what appears to be his selfless concern for children is mere scientific curiosity. In a variation of this theme, Federico in &ldquo;The Star&rdquo; breaks up with Pacita to spare her the pain that he is certain he will inflict on her, he having loved and left &ldquo;lesser stars&rdquo; before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of Latorena&rsquo;s protagonists pit career with marriage, or ambition with love, and Latorena leaves the verdict open. In &ldquo;Happiness,&rdquo; a juxtaposition is made between Conchita&rsquo;s artistic achievements and the sight of her old flame Federico, with his wife and child. In &ldquo;For the Soul Is Dead,&rdquo; the contrast made is between Rosita, who has stayed single, and Natalia, who gave up her music for marriage and family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps influenced by her teacher <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5500\">Paz Marquez Benitez</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dead Stars,&rdquo; Latorena returns time and again to the theme of the missed opportunity and the pang of belated realization. In &ldquo;Prelude to Night,&rdquo; Ester and Arturo, who is now married to Rosita and involved in politics, realize their mutual attraction too late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Latorena is best known for &ldquo;The Small Key,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sunset,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Desire,&rdquo; the only stories of hers that had been anthologized with some frequency before the publication of this collection and which are still arguably her best work. The collection allows readers certain discoveries into the craft of Latorena which reading single stories precludes. One sees, for example, that Latorena periodically returns to certain plot situations and even recycles passages. Thus, &ldquo;Two Gifts&rdquo; is &ldquo;The Small Key&rdquo; revisited and given an O. Henryesque twist. &ldquo;Plight&rdquo; is a streamlined version of &ldquo;The Way of Man&rdquo; and an homage to Sherwood Anderson&rsquo;s story &ldquo;Hands,&rdquo; from which it borrows a sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of special interest to scholars is that the collection includes the original published versions of &ldquo;The Small Key&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sunset,&rdquo; which differ from the versions that are found in anthologies and textbooks. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Pasig: Carlos Palanca Foundation Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories in this anthology, winners at the annual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Palanca Awards</a>, are a stark reminder of the troubled 1980s and represent a continuation of a persistent theme in Philippine fiction&mdash;social unrest and struggle. The decade saw the height and decline of martial law, the EDSA Revolt of 1986, and the various problems left behind by the Marcos dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories can be divided between the pre-EDSA and post-EDSA years. The pre-EDSA winning stories are concerned with the social problems brought about by military rule. The winners of 1981 may be said to comprise the strongest set of stories in this anthology. &ldquo;In Hog Heaven&rdquo; by Jessie Garcia (first prize) is about the unusual friendship between a young man trying to find his own path in life and a blind girl living with her alcoholic father. They reside in a condemned building in Manila, and the story rapidly becomes both a record of Manila&rsquo;s decline as a city and a criticism of social inequality. The story makes skillful use of contrasts, especially when beautiful language is used to describe ugliness. &ldquo;The Party-Hopper&rdquo; by Luning Bonifacio-Ira (second prize) follows a newly dead woman as she tries very hard to get her partying friends to see her or to talk about her. The story&rsquo;s surrealism is balanced by its depiction of the hypocrisy not only of the upper classes but also of the woman&rsquo;s ghost herself as she cares more about the parties that she is missing and not the fact that she is inconveniently dead. &ldquo;In These Hallowed Halls&rdquo; by Jesus Cruz (third prize) details the life of Jim Castro, a young professor thrown into campus politics owing to the possible expulsion of a student. The story depicts the corruption of a system that is supposed to be a haven for intellectuals and higher thought. Jim Castro is so caught up in his history lectures that he nearly misses a chance to engage in real events unfolding right before him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5131\">Gregorio Brillantes</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stranger in an Asian City&rdquo; (third prize, 1984), perhaps best captures the spirit of the times. This was a time when nearly all the nations in Asia were under the yoke of dictatorships. Thus, a simple conference in another Asian country gets a Filipino representative into trouble. Brillantes&rsquo;s story shows its readers that, in this regard, there are no differences at all between the Philippines and any other place in Asia. In contrast, his &ldquo;The Flood in Tarlac,&rdquo; which won the first prize in 1987, dramatizes the long-running problem of abused and exploited farmers in the haciendas of Central Luzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1980s saw the rise of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5209\">Jose Y. Dalisay</a> as one of the country&rsquo;s brightest literary stars.

				"value": "The stories in this anthology, winners at the annual <a href=\"/9/9/5159\">Palanca Awards</a>, are a stark reminder of the troubled 1980s and represent a continuation of a persistent theme in Philippine fiction&#x2014;social unrest and struggle. The decade saw the height and decline of martial law, the EDSA Revolt of 1986, and the various problems left behind by the Marcos dictatorship."

				"value": "The stories can be divided between the pre-EDSA and post-EDSA years. The pre-EDSA winning stories are concerned with the social problems brought about by military rule. The winners of 1981 may be said to comprise the strongest set of stories in this anthology. &#x201C;In Hog Heaven&#x201D; by Jessie Garcia (first prize) is about the unusual friendship between a young man trying to find his own path in life and a blind girl living with her alcoholic father. They reside in a condemned building in Manila, and the story rapidly becomes both a record of Manila&#x2019;s decline as a city and a criticism of social inequality. The story makes skillful use of contrasts, especially when beautiful language is used to describe ugliness. &#x201C;The Party-Hopper&#x201D; by Luning Bonifacio-Ira (second prize) follows a newly dead woman as she tries very hard to get her partying friends to see her or to talk about her. The story&#x2019;s surrealism is balanced by its depiction of the hypocrisy not only of the upper classes but also of the woman&#x2019;s ghost herself as she cares more about the parties that she is missing and not the fact that she is inconveniently dead. &#x201C;In These Hallowed Halls&#x201D; by Jesus Cruz (third prize) details the life of Jim Castro, a young professor thrown into campus politics owing to the possible expulsion of a student. The story depicts the corruption of a system that is supposed to be a haven for intellectuals and higher thought. Jim Castro is so caught up in his history lectures that he nearly misses a chance to engage in real events unfolding right before him."

This was a time when nearly all the nations in Asia were under the yoke of dictatorships. Thus, a simple conference in another Asian country gets a Filipino representative into trouble. Brillantes&#x2019;s story shows its readers that, in this regard, there are no differences at all between the Philippines and any other place in Asia. In contrast, his &#x201C;The Flood in Tarlac,&#x201D; which won the first prize in 1987, dramatizes the long-running problem of abused and exploited farmers in the haciendas of Central Luzon."

Editor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5490\">Edna Zapanta Manlapaz</a>. With an introduction by the editor. Manila: De La Salle University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Loreto Paras-Sulit was arguably the most prolific <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a> writer of her generation, but until the publication of this book she had not had a single-author collection to her name. This book gathers together 53 of her stories, the earliest dated 1926 and the latest, among those whose dates are known, 1946. Included are five undated stories hitherto available only in manuscript at the Ateneo Library of Women&rsquo;s Writings. A bibliography lists the titles of other stories by Paras-Sulit that have yet to be recovered. The book also includes a chronology of Paras-Sulit&rsquo;s life and an essay by Paras-Sulit titled &ldquo;All about Me,&rdquo; which briefly recounts her writing and private life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collection proper allows modern readers an overview of Paras-Sulit&rsquo;s craft and preoccupations. Duality is a recurrent theme, dramatized in three of her most famous stories. The contrasting visions of life held by the brothers Fabian and Vidal in &ldquo;Harvest&rdquo; can only be reconciled in the art of Miss Francia. In &ldquo;Balthazar,&rdquo; the rivals Lourdes and Medina&mdash;the one serene, the other fervent, both beloved by the same man&mdash;are brought together by Eduardo&rsquo;s enigmatic parting gift. In &ldquo;The Bolo,&rdquo; a crisis momentarily estranges one sister from another, one standing for idealism and the other, practicality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Romantic love figures in most of the stories. In treating the subject, Paras-Sulit ranges from the melodramatic&mdash;resorting to surprise revelations, grand confrontations, and exclamatory dialogue&mdash;to the restrained. In &ldquo;A Night&rsquo;s Vigil,&rdquo; Jose proves his devotion to Nany by saving the man that she desires, an act which ironically debars him from ever marrying her. The author uses the flashback-monologue device to heighten the drama. In &ldquo;By His Own Way,&rdquo; Roberto, a medical student, gets a girl pregnant but refuses to marry her, much to his father&rsquo;s disappointment. In &ldquo;The Flaw-Hunter,&rdquo; a woman switches a fake diamond for a real one to help her bankrupt husband. The jeweler&rsquo;s assistant turns out to be her ex-lover. Comparable to these stories are &ldquo;In Other Tongue,&rdquo; &ldquo;Not Yet,&rdquo; &ldquo;White Lace,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Years Are Many,&rdquo; and &ldquo;When East Loved West.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the other end is &ldquo;Interlude,&rdquo; where love quietly blossoms amid harsh surroundings. A chance meeting with a woman washing her clothes effects a change in Martin, a construction worker. Paras-Sulit prevents the story from sinking into sentimentality by shifting the point of view, hitherto Martin&rsquo;s, to an observer&rsquo;s in the final paragraph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The more comic aspects of love are treated in &ldquo;Love and the Carabao,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cupid in Balloon Pants,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Softening of Tandang Petra.&rdquo; Defying neat classification are the other stories depicting sundry themes, such as truth-telling (&ldquo;The Keeper&rdquo;), forgiveness (&ldquo;Eyes of the Man&rdquo;), rivalry and jealousy (&ldquo;The Call&rdquo;), modernity versus tradition (&ldquo;The Bridge&rdquo;), illusion and reality (&ldquo;Of a Far Country&rdquo;). In these, Paras-Sulit is sensitive to the mixed motivations behind human actions and refrains from casting the first stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some stories are occasional, like &ldquo;His Prisoner&rdquo; (for Rizal Day), about a jail warden from whose eyes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> removes a boil; &ldquo;Wings of Gabriel&rdquo; (for Christmas), about a father&rsquo;s discovery that he has a special child who sings every Christmas Eve; and &ldquo;Eloi,&rdquo; (for Easter), about a man who neglects his wife to listen to Jesus. Also included are high romances set in precolonial Philippines: &ldquo;The Song of the Arrow,&rdquo; which has elements of magic, and &ldquo;Laarni&mdash;A Dream,&rdquo; the story that made Paras-Sulit a household name in 1926. The postwar stories show a more morally complex universe. &ldquo;She Shall Have Peace&rdquo; asks whether forgiveness is possible after great atrocities; &ldquo;The Woman Whom War Passed By&rdquo; asks whether being physically safe during the war could be spiritually destructive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>Harvest and Other <strong>Stories</strong></strong></i></b> shows not only an individual writer&rsquo;s growing breadth and depth over a 20-year span but also that of the literary tradition to which she belonged. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemheadLIT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Published 1983. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>. Manila: Cacho Hermanos</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ten of the stories in this collection of 15 were individually published under the series Pop Stories for Groovy Kids in 1979 to commemorate the International Year of the Child. The stories are delightful retellings of fairy tales and folktales. Joaquin localizes and updates, turning Cinderella into Ela Uling and Snow White into Blanca Nieve. Joaquin also draws on Philippine folk and urban lore; thus one finds Bernardo Carpio, Maria Makiling, the aswang, and Balite Drive here. The stories do not merely retell familiar tales, however. Joaquin cleverly combines narrative lines of different tales and reinterprets traditional figures. Thus, the <i>manananggal</i> (self-segmenting ghoul) in &ldquo;The Traveling Salesman and the Split Woman&rdquo; is an angel cursed for falling in love with a mortal, her lower half being bound to earth and her upper half flying up to pursue &ldquo;the life of the spirit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike fairy tales, which are set in an indefinite time and place, Joaquin&rsquo;s stories bear the fingerprints of the era, the 1970s in the Philippines, particularly Manila. Doy&rsquo;s jeep, in &ldquo;Traveling Salesman,&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Jeeprox,&rdquo; after the slang word <i>jeproks</i>, meaning &ldquo;cool&rdquo; or &ldquo;hip&rdquo;; and Culas-Culasito&rsquo;s parents, in &ldquo;The Adventures of Culas-Culasito,&rdquo; appear in a TV sitcom called<b> </b>Joanne and Marcial, a send-up of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><b><i>John and Marsha</i></b></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As stories originally intended for children, they carry life lessons, sometimes expressed aphoristically. Thus, in &ldquo;Johnny Ti&ntilde;oso and the Proud Beauty,&rdquo; an adaptation of &ldquo;Beauty and the Beast,&rdquo; Bellita learns that not &ldquo;only the lovable are to be loved.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Sarimanok versus Ibong Adarna,&rdquo; Joaquin enters the psychology of the adolescent as he depicts the popularity contest between Elsie, who &ldquo;owns&rdquo; Ibong Adarna, and Nanette, who &ldquo;owns&rdquo; Sarimanok. The rivalry intensifies until the two girls encounter the real Sarimanok and Ibong Adarna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the stories, however, go beyond serving the usual <i>dulce et utile</i> to children and can even be disturbing. &ldquo;Lilit Bulilit and the Babe-in-the-Womb&rdquo; is a thinly veiled criticism of abortion: Lilit overhears adults arguing in its favor and so she sucks babies out of wombs with a straw. &ldquo;The Happiest Boy in the World&rdquo; can be read as a rich boy&rsquo;s confrontation with social injustice, in which his family is complicit. &ldquo;The Hamiling Mystery,&rdquo; an adaptation of the Pied Piper story, is as much a satire on corrupt bureaucracy as it is a reflection on the vanity of human wishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The grit of real city life roughens the edges of even the most fanciful of the tales. Thus, the baby Blanca Nieva, in &ldquo;The Mystery Sleeper of Balite Drive,&rdquo; is found in a dump by seven brothers, children of illegal sidewalk vendors, and is raised in a shanty, with a pushcart for cradle.

				"value": "Ten of the stories in this collection of 15 were individually published under the series Pop Stories for Groovy Kids in 1979 to commemorate the International Year of the Child. The stories are delightful retellings of fairy tales and folktales. Joaquin localizes and updates, turning Cinderella into Ela Uling and Snow White into Blanca Nieve. Joaquin also draws on Philippine folk and urban lore; thus one finds Bernardo Carpio, Maria Makiling, the aswang, and Balite Drive here. The stories do not merely retell familiar tales, however. Joaquin cleverly combines narrative lines of different tales and reinterprets traditional figures. Thus, the <i>manananggal</i> (self-segmenting ghoul) in &#x201C;The Traveling Salesman and the Split Woman&#x201D; is an angel cursed for falling in love with a mortal, her lower half being bound to earth and her upper half flying up to pursue &#x201C;the life of the spirit.&#x201D;"

The rivalry intensifies until the two girls encounter the real Sarimanok and Ibong Adarna."

				"value": "Some of the stories, however, go beyond serving the usual <i>dulce et utile</i> to children and can even be disturbing. &#x201C;Lilit Bulilit and the Babe-in-the-Womb&#x201D; is a thinly veiled criticism of abortion: Lilit overhears adults arguing in its favor and so she sucks babies out of wombs with a straw. &#x201C;The Happiest Boy in the World&#x201D; can be read as a rich boy&#x2019;s confrontation with social injustice, in which his family is complicit. &#x201C;The Hamiling Mystery,&#x201D; an adaptation of the Pied Piper story, is as much a satire on corrupt bureaucracy as it is a reflection on the vanity of human wishes."

Thus, the baby Blanca Nieva, in &#x201C;The Mystery Sleeper of Balite Drive,&#x201D; is found in a dump by seven brothers, children of illegal sidewalk vendors, and is raised in a shanty, with a pushcart for cradle. In some cases, the humor even borders on the risqu&#xE9;. &#x201C;Gotita de Dragon&#x201D; involves a mouse and a cockroach&#x2019;s search for a virgin in Malate and Ermita so they can turn Gotita the dragon back into a lizard.

In &ldquo;Kay ang Krimen Magbayad Usab&rdquo; (Because Crime Does Pay), Adlawan uses a more mature writing style as he enters the mind of the vengeance-seeking Rito, whose parents were murdered 10 years before, by an acquaintance named Manolo. The story shows how the effects of Rito&rsquo;s long-festering preoccupation with revenge affects his relationships with the people around him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Adlawan also touches on the themes of man-versus-nature in &ldquo;Ang Tiki nga Miipon sa Balay ni Moniko&rdquo; (The Lizard That Lives in the House of Moniko) and the longer &ldquo;Pagsalig&rdquo; (Faith). In the former, the subject is a small, ubiquitous animal present in perhaps every <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> household: the lizard. Moniko, the resident of the eponymous home, tries to rid his dwelling of the reptile by stabbing at it, but it surprises him in the end by leaving its dropping on him.

This depiction of love appears in &ldquo;Sampung Taong Nagdurusa&rdquo; (Ten Years&rsquo; Suffering), &ldquo;Ni Kailanman&rdquo; (Not Even Forever), and &ldquo;Napilay si Edeng&rdquo; (Edeng Got Crippled). Its most complex delineation, however, is found in &ldquo;Bilanggo&rdquo; (Prisoner), in which a poor lover seeks revenge, only to realize his folly after he has risen to wealth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fabian also turned to the theme of &ldquo;the prostitute with the golden heart&rdquo; in &ldquo;Mula sa Puso ng Dagat&rdquo; (From the Heart of the Sea), &ldquo;Sa Dako Pa Roon &hellip;&rdquo; (Over There), and &ldquo;Kay Lalim ng Gabi&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s Late).

In the introduction, Erlinda K. Alburo notes that Sotto&rsquo;s writings are expressions of his aspirations in the face of the conflicts between dogma and reason and between love and human behavior. Some of the stories were written in 1908 in Hong Kong, where Sotto was exiled for his political convictions. The stories are set against the background of the two significant events in Philippine history: the 1896 Revolution and the beginning of the American conquest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Patriotism during the height of the revolution against the Spaniards is a prominent topic in the collection. In both &ldquo;Ang Inahan sa Sundalo&rdquo; (A Soldier&rsquo;s Mother) and &ldquo;Ang mga Ilo&rdquo; (The Orphans), two revolutionary soldiers are torn between love of family and love of motherland. In the end, the soldiers choose to sacrifice themselves for their compatriots.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The effect of maternal love and romantic love on human behavior is depicted in the other stories. In &ldquo;Gugma sa Inahan&rdquo; (A Mother&rsquo;s Love), an aging mother takes back her leprosy-ridden son, who had shunned her when she was sick. In &ldquo;Panikas sa Gugma&rdquo; (A Cheat in Love), a middle-aged widow leaves her three daughters for a younger man who is only after her wealth. The stories &ldquo;Ang Salamin&rdquo; (The Mirror) and &ldquo;Kabuotan&rdquo; (Goodness) show the stages of love from courtship to amicable separation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories in the collection also have as their theme the effect of law and order on the psyche of an individual. &ldquo;Hain ang Katarungan?&rdquo; (Where Is Justice?) questions the justice system that would penalize a man for a consensual elopement. &ldquo;Ang Timaan&rdquo; (The Mark) concerns a good man who is imprisoned for a crime committed by the father of the woman he loves. The man, now embittered, is released and commits a crime of passion. Themes about family are found in &ldquo;Don Benigno,&rdquo; which is about infidelity, and &ldquo;Amahan ug Anak,&rdquo; (Father and Son), which is about disobedience of children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The conflict between social convention and an individual&rsquo;s convictions runs through most of the stories. In &ldquo;Donato,&rdquo; the title character is a 41-year-old English professor who breaks his engagement with a beautiful yet promiscuous heiress from Maguindanao to marry his pudgy servant. In &ldquo;Ang Tinagoan ni Teresa&rdquo; (Teresa&rsquo;s Secret), a woman gives birth to a boy out of wedlock and sends him far away to Maguindanao. This attempt to keep up the appearance of propriety brings about dire consequences.

However, even in his very first short story, &ldquo;Ang Kalupi&rdquo; (The Wallet), 1952, he treats the familiar theme of class oppression with a double irony as he demonstrates how the poor can also be oppressed by the poor.

He thus loses his faith in both the system and God.

In &ldquo;Ang Linggo ni Pepe&rdquo; (Pepe&rsquo;s Week), the playboy Pepe is stranded on an island with six beautiful women. Pepe must divide his week among them, giving them one day each to maintain peace on the island.

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book gathers together 42 of Amado V. Hernandez&rsquo;s stories, written within a span of 45 years and previously published in popular magazines such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i>Bulaklak</i></b>, <b><i>Dalaga</i></b>,<i> </i>and <b><i><strong>Sampaguita</strong></i></b>, and literary anthologies. With a few exceptions, the stories are chronologically arranged, starting with &ldquo;Magpinsan&rdquo; (Cousins), 1924, and ending with the title story, 1970. The order shows the development of Hernandez&rsquo;s fiction writing, with the subject matter of love and society threading through them. Personal relationships, as depicted, are tested by social realities like class conflict, war, crime, and displacement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hernandez&rsquo;s inclination for questioning social convention is instantly apparent in &ldquo;Magpinsan&rdquo; (Cousins), which depicts two cousins defying the taboo against incest. However, its initial optimism is followed by love stories that end badly: in &ldquo;Liham na Lihim&rdquo; (Secret Letter), 1924, a letter reveals the truth behind a sportsman&rsquo;s death; in &ldquo;Kay Saklap&rdquo; (How Bitter), 1925, a finicky young man gets his comeuppance from the woman he finally chooses; in &ldquo;Nasawing Bulaklak&rdquo; (Fallen Flower), 1925, a man chooses America over his sweetheart, who then wastes away; and in &ldquo;Kasal sa Pastor&rdquo; (Wed by a Pastor), 1928, a girl chooses a doctor over other, lowlier suitors, to her misfortune. Hernandez is adept at giving the formulaic plot a refreshingly novel twist. In &ldquo;Sa Oras ng Panganib&rdquo; (In a Perilous Time), 1928, four suitors undergo an ordeal by fire, and only one can come out unscathed. &ldquo;Panata ni Pilar&rdquo; (Pilar&rsquo;s Vow), 1936, proves that constancy in love has its rewards but also exacts a price. Thirty-four years after Hernandez&rsquo;s first, taboo-breaking story, he again challenges social convention in &ldquo;Sapot ng Panganorin&rdquo; (Horizon&rsquo;s Cobweb), 1958, which places a 1950s couple in multiple scandalous situations: a nurse-patient, May-December, adulterous affair that leads to divorce and a legal, second marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some stories feature women&rsquo;s relationships across generations. In &ldquo;Reyna ng Tahanan&rdquo; (Queen of the Household), 1956, a girl consults her grandmother about love and career as a beauty queen. In &ldquo;Ang Kanaryo at ang Bantay&rdquo; (The Canary and the Warden), 1958, a demanding mother chooses a rich Chinese for her reluctant daughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Power is personified by rich old men who misuse it either through cunning manipulation or outright violence, such as the lecherous old businessman, in &ldquo;Pangalugi ng Milyonaryo&rdquo; (Millionaire&rsquo;s Loss), 1958, posing as a benevolent employer, whereas in &ldquo;Dalawang Metro sa Lupang Hindi Malipad ng Uwak&rdquo; (Two Meters of the Land the Crow Cannot Range Across), 1970, it is a rapacious landlord. Standing like David to such Goliaths are Hernandez&rsquo;s heroes, such as the idealistic mayor in &ldquo;May Uling sa Palayok&rdquo; (There&rsquo;s Soot on the Pot), 1959, and the beleaguered union leader in &ldquo;Panata ng Isang Lider&rdquo; (Vow of a Leader), 1960.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The large-scale violence of war is dramatized through individual, human dilemmas, such as that in &ldquo;Takas&rdquo; (Runaway), 1959, in which enemies in war are also entangled in a love triangle; and in &ldquo;Nasaan ang Medalya?&rdquo; (Where Is the Medal?), 1957, in which a grandfather aids an American fugitive from the death march.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Country life is shown in a positive light, especially in contrast to Manila. In &ldquo;Sa Sariling Pugad&rdquo; (In One&rsquo;s Own Nest), 1925, a trip to Manila reaffirms for the character the virtues of farm life. In &ldquo;Pamana&rdquo; (Heritage), 1958, a peasant family&rsquo;s wealth is an heirloom piece, a jade plate that is beyond price. On the other hand, Hernandez&rsquo;s Manila is populated by desperate individuals who were once innocent country folk, such as those in &ldquo;Ang Aginaldo ng Kanyang Anak&rdquo; (Her Son&rsquo;s Gift), 1929, about a student turned boxer; &ldquo;Buntot ng Bahaghari&rdquo; (End of the Rainbow), 1957, about two job-seeking friends; and &ldquo;Kislap ng Utak, Pawis ng Noo&rdquo; (Spark of the Brain, Sweat of the Brow), 1970, about a jeepney driver with a teaching degree. In the last story, &ldquo;Langaw sa Isang Basong Gatas,&rdquo; Hernandez dramatizes the inevitability of the oppressed proletariat taking up arms. Here, an informal settler (or &ldquo;squatter&rdquo; in Hernandez&rsquo;s time) forced out of his home ends up taking two bolos and a whetstone as the church bells in the newly built subdivision ring out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hernandez&rsquo;s stories are a chronicle of Filipino historical experience through the Commonwealth, the Japanese occupation, and post-World War II rehabilitation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Arbeen Acu&ntilde;a</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

In &#x201C;Sa Oras ng Panganib&#x201D; (In a Perilous Time), 1928, four suitors undergo an ordeal by fire, and only one can come out unscathed. &#x201C;Panata ni Pilar&#x201D; (Pilar&#x2019;s Vow), 1936, proves that constancy in love has its rewards but also exacts a price. Thirty-four years after Hernandez&#x2019;s first, taboo-breaking story, he again challenges social convention in &#x201C;Sapot ng Panganorin&#x201D; (Horizon&#x2019;s Cobweb), 1958, which places a 1950s couple in multiple scandalous situations: a nurse-patient, May-December, adulterous affair that leads to divorce and a legal, second marriage."

Standing like David to such Goliaths are Hernandez&#x2019;s heroes, such as the idealistic mayor in &#x201C;May Uling sa Palayok&#x201D; (There&#x2019;s Soot on the Pot), 1959, and the beleaguered union leader in &#x201C;Panata ng Isang Lider&#x201D; (Vow of a Leader), 1960."

In &#x201C;Pamana&#x201D; (Heritage), 1958, a peasant family&#x2019;s wealth is an heirloom piece, a jade plate that is beyond price. On the other hand, Hernandez&#x2019;s Manila is populated by desperate individuals who were once innocent country folk, such as those in &#x201C;Ang Aginaldo ng Kanyang Anak&#x201D; (Her Son&#x2019;s Gift), 1929, about a student turned boxer; &#x201C;Buntot ng Bahaghari&#x201D; (End of the Rainbow), 1957, about two job-seeking friends; and &#x201C;Kislap ng Utak, Pawis ng Noo&#x201D; (Spark of the Brain, Sweat of the Brow), 1970, about a jeepney driver with a teaching degree. In the last story, &#x201C;Langaw sa Isang Basong Gatas,&#x201D; Hernandez dramatizes the inevitability of the oppressed proletariat taking up arms. Here, an informal settler (or &#x201C;squatter&#x201D; in Hernandez&#x2019;s time) forced out of his home ends up taking two bolos and a whetstone as the church bells in the newly built subdivision ring out."

The story also depicts how gender differentiation is established in childhood and how gender roles are crystallized in adulthood. &ldquo;Water from the Well,&rdquo; somewhat heavy with fecundity symbols, is a love story with a happy ending, as the middle-aged lovers Tesiang and Mr Gloria deserve. In this languorous story, Alfon weaves a bucolic &ldquo;dream of silence, peace, and contentment.&rdquo; In contrast, &ldquo;The Gentle Rain&rdquo; is about a woman of the upper class who leads an unloved life, even as she herself loves passionately. &ldquo;Man with a Camera&rdquo; and its twin piece &ldquo;The Photographed Beggar&rdquo; are about charity, kindness, and cruelty. At least three stories&mdash;&ldquo;Servant Girl,&rdquo; &ldquo;English,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Those That Love Us&rdquo;&mdash;show a scope and sensitivity reaching to other classes, other climes.

Vidal and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5532\">Ma. Crisanta S. Nelmida</a>. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This two-part anthology consists of 21 short stories in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\\\\\">Kapampangan</a>, edited by Vidal, and 10 short stories in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, edited by Nelmida. The Kapampangan stories were originally published in magazines between 1911 and 1980; the Pangasinan, between the 1930s and the 1960s. Vidal and Nelmida translate the stories into Filipino, and each provides a historical introduction to her section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Kapampangan stories reflect the times in which they were written. Written right after the Philippine-American war, &ldquo;Ing Pasionaria&rdquo; (The Pasyonara) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3269\">Crisostomo Soto</a> has for a protagonist a native soldier who is not cowed by the superior arms of the enemy. &ldquo;Y Miss Phatupats&rdquo; (Miss Phatupats), also by Soto, satirizes those who aspire to Western ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The influence of the Church is evident in &ldquo;Luis, ing Mamulang&rdquo; (Luis, the Madman) by Amador (pseud. of Felix Bautista), where the protagonist meets Sinang during Lent and loses his sanity when she marries somebody else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1920s, Kapampangan poetry entered a vigorous phase, encouraging short story writers to attempt stories in verse. These are lyrical stories. Such are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5795\">Amado M. Yuzon</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rosa&rdquo; and &ldquo;Simbang Bengi&rdquo; (Midnight Mass) and Rosario Tuazon Baluyut&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mepuspus Na&rdquo; (Finished). &ldquo;Simbang Bengi,&rdquo; consisting of 21 rhyming quatrains, with each verse having 16 syllables, is about Mary and Ruben. When Mary&rsquo;s parents have her wed another man, Ruben kills himself outside the church. &ldquo;Mepuspus Na&rdquo; describes a storm that landed on 16 Oct 1934 in 10 quatrains of rhyming dodecasyllabic lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alongside this development, however, is the influence of journalism, seen in Baluyut&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pamamali&rdquo; (Revenge), which recounts the hunting down and execution of a landowner who mistreated the protagonist&rsquo;s family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, Kapampangan fictionists began to employ indirection and the telling narrative detail. Such a style is observed in &ldquo;Sisilim&rdquo; (Twilight) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5472\">Diosdado Macapagal</a> where an old man and woman sitting in the park recount their failed romances. By the story&rsquo;s end, the reader discovers that they were once a couple and each has been looking for the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Love of country is the subject of &ldquo;Matimbu&rdquo; by Magdiwa (pseud.) in which a soldier of the Katipunan loses his life trying to save his comrades on the other side of the river Matimbu from an ambush. &ldquo;Sumpa ning Poeta&rdquo; (A Poet&rsquo;s Curse) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2954\">Jose M. Gallardo</a> reflects on the paradoxical life of a poet, whose fame did not save his son from death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1980s, realism dominated the Kapampangan short story, and the selections reflect contemporary issues: illegal recruitment and the hardships suffered by overseas workers, in Querubin D. Fernandez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ing Kapagpabustan&rdquo; (Negligence); violence wrought by militarization, in Ramiro Mercado&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bye Alamang&rdquo; (A Dog&rsquo;s Life); and the pollution of the river, in Florentino Turla&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ing Buluc ning Sentral&rdquo; (The Garbage of Central).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other stories in the anthology are &ldquo;Cuadrong Matuling&rdquo; (Black Picture) by Juan Crisostomo Soto, &ldquo;Talimhaga&rdquo; (Metaphor) by Amado M. Yuzon, &ldquo;Ing Manuc Cung Texas&rdquo; (My Texas Chicken) by Rosendo M. Vergara, and &ldquo;Pascu ning Preso&rdquo; (The Prisoner&rsquo;s Christmas) by Mariano C. Sigua.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nelmida observes that the Pangasinan short stories, taken from the magazine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5084\"><b><i>Silew</i></b></a>, are informed by orality and didacticism. In stories like the anonymous &ldquo;Tita ya Agwari Asabin Iyanak&rdquo; (Tita Who Was Almost Not Born), the author directly states his or her opinions and endorses the values of respect for one&rsquo;s parents and faith in God. Drawing on the exemplary tales of the Spanish colonial period, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5478\">Maria Magsano</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kaonoran ya Bilin: Tongtong a Tugtuwan Agawa&rdquo; (Last Words: A True Story) reminds readers to ask Jesus to help them carry life&rsquo;s crosses and portrays women as long-suffering, weak, and reserved. Bella Luz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ulaula to Lambengat&rdquo; (His Blandishments) warns girls against forming amorous relationships too early.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Vida&rdquo; by Maria Magsano and &ldquo;Panibeg tan Irap na Linawa&rdquo; (Love and Pain) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5772\">Juan C. Villamil</a> share the same premise&mdash;the protagonist&rsquo;s love interest is a blood relation of his enemy&mdash;but arrive at opposite conclusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Love triumphs in &ldquo;Say &lsquo;Gayuma&rsquo; nen Laki Simeon&rdquo; (Grandfather Simeon&rsquo;s &lsquo;Charm&rsquo;) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5161\">Leonarda Carrera</a>, which has a surprise ending, &ldquo;Pinawil Toray Boleg To&rdquo; (He Returned to His Family) by Eufemia Villamil, and &ldquo;Kaonoran ya Kaut&rdquo; (Last Ball) by Juan C. Villamil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other stories in the anthology are &ldquo;Aseleng na Inawa&rdquo; (Blinded by Comfort) by Eufemina Villamil and &ldquo;Siopay Akankasalanan?&rdquo; (Who&rsquo;s to Blame?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the whole, the short stories in the anthology are a record of life in two provinces for the greater part of the 20th century. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Rowena Festin</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Manila: Kalikasan Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The five stories and two chapters of a proposed novel in this collection dramatize life in the northern countryside on the eve of martial law. They speak about resistance and struggle against oppression, injustice, and exploitation by the ruling class. The narratives range from the armed conflicts in a remote nook of the mountains to an indigenous ritual feast in Baguio, and to the picket lines in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The title story is about the coming of age of a boy in a far-flung barrio, where the people are caught in the cross fire between the military and rebel factions. The story opens with a lifeless body of a rebel sprawled in front of the municipal hall. The boy becomes politically enlightened as adult conversations about their family&rsquo;s ties with the rebel are filtered through his innocent mind. Later on, the boy discovers that the executed rebel was the same person who had been his brother&rsquo;s companion in the mountains. It is the doctor who helped them heal the barrio&rsquo;s physical and social illnesses. In &ldquo;Mga Panauhin ni Selo&rdquo; (Selo&rsquo;s Visitors), the title character is a former rebel-turned-peasant, who chooses to isolate himself and his family from the town center. One stormy night, a rebel group takes shelter in his house. Selo recounts to them his past as a rebel. This recollection reawakens his sociopolitical beliefs and convictions. The story&rsquo;s end depicts a reborn and triumphant Selo as he takes his scythe to start a new day of mowing, reaping, and struggling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two stories feature female protagonists who shatter stereotypes of the feminine heroine. &ldquo;Mga Titik sa Dambuhalang Bato&rdquo; (Letters in the Giant Rock) is an epistolary narrative that pieces together the portrait of a woman who turns her back on a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; life in the city for her political convictions. Clarita, the protagonist, after devoting her life to the city&rsquo;s picket lines, now continues the struggle in the mountains. She has given up her lover, Noel, because of their conflicting ideologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The eponymous character in &ldquo;Ang Pinakahuling Kuwento ni Huli&rdquo; (The Final Story of Huli) is a mute outcast whose life story has been authored for her by other people, whose speculations and conjectures are based on presumptions about the nature of women. Here, the author weaves together various myths and legends about women in patriarchal literature: the seamstress made pregnant by her employer, the prostitute suffering from syphilis, and the woman sold by her grandfather to a landlord. Despite her isolation, Huli is visited by nameless friends who, like her, yearn for freedom and equality. This story is told in a lyrical style, which creates a surrealistic effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The story &ldquo;Grand Ca&ntilde;ao&rdquo; is a striking portrait of a conflict between an indigene and a colonizer. During the day of the grand <i>ca&ntilde;ao</i> (indigenous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a> feast in Benguet), an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a> gets into a brawl with his American employer after the latter&rsquo;s sexual innuendos. &ldquo;Ang Tugtugin ni Kabayan&rdquo; (The Music of Kabayan) and &ldquo;Pagka&rsquo;t Ako, si Naciana Madrigal, Ay Laging May Ipinagpapaliban&rdquo; (For I, Naciana Madrigal, Am Always Deferring) are chapters from an intended novel. Told in a stream-of-consciousness style, these stories sketch a woman writer&rsquo;s life, from her youth in Baguio, up to her First Quarter Storm awakening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Manggagagamot ng Salay-salay&rdquo; won first prize at the 1978 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Palanca Awards</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jay Jomar F.

Later on, the boy discovers that the executed rebel was the same person who had been his brother&#x2019;s companion in the mountains. It is the doctor who helped them heal the barrio&#x2019;s physical and social illnesses. In &#x201C;Mga Panauhin ni Selo&#x201D; (Selo&#x2019;s Visitors), the title character is a former rebel-turned-peasant, who chooses to isolate himself and his family from the town center. One stormy night, a rebel group takes shelter in his house. Selo recounts to them his past as a rebel. This recollection reawakens his sociopolitical beliefs and convictions. The story&#x2019;s end depicts a reborn and triumphant Selo as he takes his scythe to start a new day of mowing, reaping, and struggling."

Here, the author weaves together various myths and legends about women in patriarchal literature: the seamstress made pregnant by her employer, the prostitute suffering from syphilis, and the woman sold by her grandfather to a landlord. Despite her isolation, Huli is visited by nameless friends who, like her, yearn for freedom and equality. This story is told in a lyrical style, which creates a surrealistic effect."

Zosimo, the tenant, can overtake a jeepney, catch fish in a rocky yard, and carry a carabao by the horns as he climbs up a coconut tree. &ldquo;Si Manang Merin ug ang Kasing&rdquo; (Manang Merin and the Top), set in a copra plantation, and &ldquo;Pahigmata&rdquo; (The Awakening) are initiation stories, with hunger as an underlying theme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two stories explore the contrast between city and barrio. &ldquo;Ang Kalibutan Matapos&rdquo; (The World Will End) dabbles in a bit of black humor.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5210\">Pedro S. Dandan</a>. With an introduction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio S. Almario</a>. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Written between the post-World War II years and the early 1970s, this posthumous collection of 21 stories charts a period of great transition for the country. This is manifest in such subjects as the city&rsquo;s physical configuration in &ldquo;May Buhay sa Looban&rdquo; (There Is Life in the Slums); the rural landscape in &ldquo;Ang Kalabaw at ang Tren&rdquo; (The Carabao and the Train) and &ldquo;Paalam kay Kalakian&rdquo; (Farewell to Kalakian); and history in &ldquo;Ang Inahing Aso at Limang Tuta&rdquo; (A Dog and Her Five Puppies), &ldquo;Sugat ng Digma&rdquo; (Wound of War), &ldquo;Ang Kalmen at Batumbuhay &hellip; sa Isang Estero&rdquo; (The Scapular and Stone &hellip; at an Estuary).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The title story is a bildungsroman that follows 13-year-old Popoy, whose facade of toughness is shaken by his family&rsquo;s impending move to Dampalit, possibly in Malabon, then a town in the suburban province of Rizal. His father, a writer who is looking to enter the real-life Commonwealth Literary Contests, bemoans the lack of love, beauty, and life in the ugly surroundings of the <i>looban</i>, a labyrinthine network of slums in Dandan&rsquo;s Tondo. In the same breath, however, his father enumerates the sights and sounds in the slums, the constant bustle and activity, the cast of characters that, to Popoy and the reader both, are enough evidence of &ldquo;life.&rdquo; This delineation between literary illusion and immediate reality is revisited in &ldquo;Kalapating May Sugat sa Dibdib&rdquo; (Dove with a Wounded Breast), in which an aging writer pines over a &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; whom he has &ldquo;bought&rdquo; from a brothel with proceeds from his last novel. He reflects on the little control writers have over their own lives, unlike the material for art at their disposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other stories that probe various aspects of city life are by turns tragic and humorous: &ldquo;Nasa Dugo ni Tana&rdquo; (It Runs in Tana&rsquo;s Blood) is on gambling addiction; &ldquo;Isang Showdown sa Tundo&rdquo; (A Showdown in Tondo), on street violence; &ldquo;Batman,&rdquo; on mental health; and &ldquo;Mabangis na Kamay, Maamong Kamay&rdquo; (Ferocious Hand, Tame Hand), on grinding poverty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the rural stories, the carabao is a prominent figure, whose death signals such change and transition. Tradition and modernity clash in &ldquo;Ang Kalabaw at ang Tren,&rdquo; in which a train collides with the carabao; and in &ldquo;Paalam kay Kalakian,&rdquo; about the impending replacement of carabaos by tractors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories that invoke the war are the most unflinching in their brutality. In &ldquo;Palitan&rdquo; (Exchange), a man trades his son for a sack of rice to feed his starving wife and their four other children. In &ldquo;Ang Inahing Aso at Limang Tuta&rdquo; (The Dog and Her Five Puppies), extreme hunger drives a young boy to take extreme measures. &ldquo;At Nupling ang Isang Lunting Halaman&rdquo; (And a Green Bud Sprouts) follows the last excruciating moments of a soldier amid an exchange of gunfire and retreat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the most tragic and allegorical in the lot, &ldquo;Ang Kalmen at Batumbuhay &hellip; sa Isang Estero&rdquo; revolves around the vagrant Mang Simo, who was an informal settler in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> before his eviction. When he is run over by a train, bystanders partake of his possessions and capitalize on his death.

In the same breath, however, his father enumerates the sights and sounds in the slums, the constant bustle and activity, the cast of characters that, to Popoy and the reader both, are enough evidence of &#x201C;life.&#x201D; This delineation between literary illusion and immediate reality is revisited in &#x201C;Kalapating May Sugat sa Dibdib&#x201D; (Dove with a Wounded Breast), in which an aging writer pines over a &#x201C;beloved&#x201D; whom he has &#x201C;bought&#x201D; from a brothel with proceeds from his last novel.

Quezon City: Severino Reyes Publishing Corporation, 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>Lola</strong></i></b> <b><i>Basyang</i></b> is a familiar figure in modern Philippine folklore as the purveyor of fairy tales, fables, parables, and fantasies, all of which had a large following when they appeared in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\"><b><i>Liwayway</i></b></a><i> </i>magazine, and later aired over the radio. The universe of <b><i>Lola</i></b> <b><i>Basyang</i></b> is peopled by a colorful constellation of characters who are magical, mythical, religious, romantic, or supernatural, who dwell on the earth, underground, under the sea, in the sky, and in enchanted places. These characters are drawn from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a> stories, ancient folklore, local legends, apocrypha, and the like. While the primary object of Lola Basyang&rsquo;s storytelling is to entertain, the didactic or moralistic content of the stories has had a great impact, particularly on young listeners or readers to whom they are primarily addressed. The legendary narrator of the stories is herself a fictitious character, the real author being Severino Reyes, who was a pioneering figure in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> theater. However, there was indeed a Lola Basyang who served as Reyes&rsquo;s inspiration in writing his stories. One time, Don Binoy, as Reyes was called, got invited for dinner at the house of Gervasia Guzman de Zamora, matriarch of a prominent clan in Quiapo district in Manila. The old lady was popular among the children of the place because after dinner, she would have them gather around her to listen to her stories, as she held her<i> hitsuhan </i>or betel-nut container. The scene gave Don Binoy an idea. The first of &ldquo;Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang&rdquo; appeared on 25 May 1925 in the weekly <b><i>Liwayway</i></b><i> </i>magazine. Its title was &ldquo;Ang Plautin ni Periking&rdquo; (Periking&rsquo;s Flute), the story of three orphaned brothers named Berto, Tolo, and Periking, who catch a fish that turns out to be an <i>engkantado</i>,<i> </i>a<i> </i>possessor of magical powers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More stories followed, including &ldquo;Ang Sirena sa Uli-uli ng Ilog Pasig&rdquo; (The Mermaid in the Whirlpool of the River Pasig), &ldquo;Maryang Makiling,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ang Tatlong Prinsipe&rdquo; (The Three Princes), &ldquo;Binibining Tumalo sa Mahal na Hari&rdquo; (The Girl Who Outwitted the King), &ldquo;Ang Walong Bulag&rdquo; (The Eight Blind Men), &ldquo;Mahiwagang Kuba&rdquo; (The Mysterious Hunchback), &ldquo;Ang Higanti ng Duwende&rdquo; (The Dwarf&rsquo;s Revenge), &ldquo;Ang Prinsesang Unggoy&rdquo; (The Monkey Princess), and hundreds of other imaginative tales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reyes&rsquo;s stories were not simple &ldquo;escapist&rdquo; fare, however. Like his earlier plays and <i>sarsuwela</i>, his stories depicted the social tension that characterized his milieu. But because the stories were meant for a young audience, the commentaries were subtly cloaked. Criticism was conveyed through characterization, highlighting the positive qualities of Filipinos and the negative qualities of foreign usurpers and of those in power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories enjoyed airtime on radio for many years in the 1950s. They also appeared in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><b>komiks</b></a>. Like the old metrical romances, the stories became the source of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1065\">fantasy films</a>, and later were adapted for television. Many Filipino childhood memories include listening to the radio as a familiar old woman&rsquo;s voice would say in Tagalog: &ldquo;Gather round me now, and be quiet, for my story is about to begin &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1997, a selection, made by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido L. Lumbera</a>, of Lola Basyang stories were translated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5183\">Gilda Cordero-Fernando</a> and published as <b><i>The Best of Lola Basyang: Timeless Tales for the Filipino Family</i></b>. Three more compilations, from two publishers, were edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2783\">Christine Bellen</a>, all titled <b><i><strong><strong><strong>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</strong></strong></strong></i></b>, 2005, 2006, 2012. Several of the Lola Basyang stories have been issued as individual children&rsquo;s books, retold by Bellen, with English translations. Six of these were adapted for dance by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2405\">Ballet</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2405\"> Manila</a>: <b><i>Tatlong Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</i></b>, 2009,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Tatlo Pang Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</i></b>, 2012.

				"value": "<b><i><strong>Lola</strong></i></b> <b><i>Basyang</i></b> is a familiar figure in modern Philippine folklore as the purveyor of fairy tales, fables, parables, and fantasies, all of which had a large following when they appeared in <a href=\"/9/9/5458\"><b><i>Liwayway</i></b></a><i> </i>magazine, and later aired over the radio. The universe of <b><i>Lola</i></b> <b><i>Basyang</i></b> is peopled by a colorful constellation of characters who are magical, mythical, religious, romantic, or supernatural, who dwell on the earth, underground, under the sea, in the sky, and in enchanted places. These characters are drawn from <a href=\"/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a> stories, ancient folklore, local legends, apocrypha, and the like. While the primary object of Lola Basyang&#x2019;s storytelling is to entertain, the didactic or moralistic content of the stories has had a great impact, particularly on young listeners or readers to whom they are primarily addressed. The legendary narrator of the stories is herself a fictitious character, the real author being Severino Reyes, who was a pioneering figure in <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> theater. However, there was indeed a Lola Basyang who served as Reyes&#x2019;s inspiration in writing his stories. One time, Don Binoy, as Reyes was called, got invited for dinner at the house of Gervasia Guzman de Zamora, matriarch of a prominent clan in Quiapo district in Manila. The old lady was popular among the children of the place because after dinner, she would have them gather around her to listen to her stories, as she held her<i> hitsuhan </i>or betel-nut container. The scene gave Don Binoy an idea. The first of &#x201C;Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang&#x201D; appeared on 25 May 1925 in the weekly <b><i>Liwayway</i></b><i> </i>magazine. Its title was &#x201C;Ang Plautin ni Periking&#x201D; (Periking&#x2019;s Flute), the story of three orphaned brothers named Berto, Tolo, and Periking, who catch a fish that turns out to be an <i>engkantado</i>,<i> </i>a<i> </i>possessor of magical powers."

Like his earlier plays and <i>sarsuwela</i>, his stories depicted the social tension that characterized his milieu. But because the stories were meant for a young audience, the commentaries were subtly cloaked. Criticism was conveyed through characterization, highlighting the positive qualities of Filipinos and the negative qualities of foreign usurpers and of those in power."

Rotor</a>. With a foreword by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a>. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>The Men Who Play God</strong></i></b> is a collection of 10 short stories about doctors, patients, and the ailments that not only call for a cure but also provoke a philosophical search for meaning in death and mortality. Rotor&rsquo;s doctors struggle to arrive at the correct diagnosis not only to treat patients but also to solve ethical or moral dilemmas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book&rsquo;s title story, &ldquo;The Men Who Play God,&rdquo; establishes the shared time and setting of the collection. Setting the tone for the life-and-death decisions that doctors must make about their patients are the rich and detailed contrasts between <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Taft Avenue, Ermita</a>, and Malate during the American era and these places in the late 1970s and 1980s; a quoted passage from <b><i>History and Description of the Philippine General Hospital</i></b>; and the limited equipment of the government hospital. The godlike role that the doctors play is emphasized when they convene to decide which of their patients gets the one vacant room available in the Philippine General Hospital (PGH). All three patients have equally critical conditions, but the decision lies in the personal preference of the physicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The doctors and patients in each story wrestle with mortality and morality. Dr Morales, protagonist of &ldquo;The Orchid of Five Wounds,&rdquo; forgoes the objectivity demanded by the field as he seeks meaning in the unfortunate blinding and possible demise of a young, kindhearted girl named Inday. The three doctors in &ldquo;Club Euthanasia&rdquo; debate the morality of ending the life of a comatose individual. In &ldquo;Santiago&rsquo;s Syndrome,&rdquo; a patient comes to terms with a mysterious illness, which brings fame to the medical community and death to him. Even the socioeconomic aspects of the medical field are subjected to Rotor&rsquo;s philosophical eye: in &ldquo;Judas Iscariot, MD,&rdquo; the title character clinically assesses a patient&rsquo;s ability to pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;The Jubilarians&rdquo; is ostensibly an account of a PGH alumni homecoming, the underlying theme being the passing of time and the body&rsquo;s deterioration.

This struggle is central to nearly every story in <b><i>Nague&ntilde;os</i></b>. In &ldquo;Typhoon,&rdquo; it is explicitly dramatized directly when its narrator, Father Itos, contemplates leaving the Church after its rigid and patriarchal laws ostracize a battered housewife for seeking refuge with another man. In most of the stories, however, the crises of faith are couched in other, less obviously religious narratives, tying the personal and the spiritual together with the tropes of death and resurrection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most common narrative involves the erotic desire of middle-aged men for young women.

Similarly, in &ldquo;Chinita,&rdquo; ex-seminarian Rick Caceres struggles with both the loss of faith and his sudden desire to impress a college girl named Cynthia Dee. The story continues in &ldquo;Sanctuary,&rdquo; where Rick and Cynthia are accosted by a gang of thugs as they are discussing the cosmic battle between good and evil.

Almost 35 years later, the first volume was published, and includes what Yabes considers &ldquo;the best short stories written in English by the more important Filipino writers before the outbreak of the war in the Pacific. It constitutes the first recorded attempt to collect together in one volume the worthwhile stories that were published between 1925&mdash;the year the first Filipino short story in English appeared in a Filipino-owned and Filipino-edited periodical in English&mdash;and 1940.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The volume has a threefold purpose: &ldquo;to preserve in a more permanent and handy form the best that have been produced in English by Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a> writers; to give a better chance for these writers to be known and appreciated abroad; and to help promote better understanding between the Filipinos and other peoples.&rdquo; Obviously the compelling motive then was to introduce Filipino writers to the English-reading public abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The anthology is historical and critical, and sometimes, Yabes admits, &ldquo;it was necessary to include some inferior stories of an earlier year and exclude obviously better stories of a later date, because the former were the best of the crop published in that particular period, and to exclude them would leave a gap in the chronology of the anthology.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An essay, &ldquo;Pioneering in the Filipino Short Story in English,&rdquo; written in 1941, precedes the anthology proper of 1925-40 volume, which starts with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5500\">Paz Marquez Benitez</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dead Stars,&rdquo; and includes such writers as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5148\">Casiano T.

In his short stories, Joaquin conceives of the Filipino as a historical creation, the result of the forced yoking together of conflicting forces. In &ldquo;The Summer Solstice,&rdquo; the submerged ancient culture rears its head defiantly in the <i>tadtarin</i>,<i> </i>a ritual celebrating fertility and the female principle, which coincides with the folk Christian devotional feast dedicated to Saint John the Percursor. When not plumbing the primordial caverns of the Filipino spirit, Joaquin dwells nostalgically on the Spanish colonial heritage, cherished and lavishly described in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> of &ldquo;The Mass of St. Sylvester&rdquo; and <b><i><strong>The Woman Who Had Two Navels</strong></i></b>.<br />\r\nThere are also reflections on the devastation wrought by World War II on culture and the psyche. The sadly diminished characters alternately reject the heritage of the past and flounder about in the present, as they search for a rudder to lead them into the future. Joaquin&rsquo;s protagonists are forced to confront the reality that they are creatures in which all three forces&mdash;the native-animist, the Spanish colonial, and the postwar modern&mdash;either coexist or conflict with one another. Both Agueda and Badoy Montiya of &ldquo;May Day Eve&rdquo; face the mirror to see into the future and discover the images of their prospective spouses. Each sees the other&rsquo;s face: demon/witch and lover. Celo Monzon of &ldquo;Three Generations&rdquo; seeks to defeat the spirit of his violent father by forcing him into submission. In doing so, he is likewise forced to recognize that the same tendencies exist in him. The past continues to confront the protagonist both from without and within. Until these conflicting, confounding forces are resolved, the strains are unsuccessfully interwoven and harmonized, the portrait of the Filipino, Joaquin suggests, will emerge only as a blur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his poetry, Joaquin is a blend of cultures and traditions: Bible, Greek mythology, Mother Goose, Lorca, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>. The poems have different voices, styles, resonances. &ldquo;The Innocence of Solomon&rdquo; is psalm-like, intoned with purposely imperfect rhyming: &ldquo;But wisdom never was content / and flesh when ripened falls at last: / what will I have when the seasons mint / your golden breasts into golden dust?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poem &ldquo;Six P.M.&rdquo; has a refreshing contemporary sound, memorable for its ironic wit and parallel images. It is about a workaday employee, incidentally a poet too, whose life is thus alternately cramped and cosmic: &ldquo;Trouvere at night, grammarian in the morning, / ruefully architecting syllables.&rdquo; The poet/employee takes his place &ldquo;in the bus among people returning / to love (domesticated) and the smell of onions burning.&rdquo;<br />\r\nHis meditations end with a definitive acceptance of his lot: &ldquo;conquistador tonight, clock-puncher tomorrow.&rdquo; The best-known poems of Joaquin in this collection are &ldquo;Verde Yo Te Quiero Verde&rdquo; (Green I Love You Green), a title inspired by Federico Garcia Lorca, and &ldquo;Valedictory Address,&rdquo; Joaquin&rsquo;s translation of Rizal&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\">&ldquo;Mi Ultimo Adios&rdquo;</a> (My Last Farewell). The former is structured rather in the avant-gardist style, with its truncated lines, single-word lines, double and triple colons, unusual compounds, and startling images. The preference and love for green is expressed at various planes of feeling: the pristine quality of the natural world, associations with peace and tranquility, and the quality of being alone, primordial, and virgin. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4146\">Elena Rivera Mirano</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4146\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

It is about a workaday employee, incidentally a poet too, whose life is thus alternately cramped and cosmic: &#x201C;Trouvere at night, grammarian in the morning, / ruefully architecting syllables.&#x201D; The poet/employee takes his place &#x201C;in the bus among people returning / to love (domesticated) and the smell of onions burning.&#x201D;<br>\nHis meditations end with a definitive acceptance of his lot: &#x201C;conquistador tonight, clock-puncher tomorrow.&#x201D; The best-known poems of Joaquin in this collection are &#x201C;Verde Yo Te Quiero Verde&#x201D; (Green I Love You Green), a title inspired by Federico Garcia Lorca, and &#x201C;Valedictory Address,&#x201D; Joaquin&#x2019;s translation of Rizal&#x2019;s <a href=\"/9/78/1911\">&#x201C;Mi Ultimo Adios&#x201D;</a> (My Last Farewell). The former is structured rather in the avant-gardist style, with its truncated lines, single-word lines, double and triple colons, unusual compounds, and startling images. The preference and love for green is expressed at various planes of feeling: the pristine quality of the natural world, associations with peace and tranquility, and the quality of being alone, primordial, and virgin. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a> and <a href=\"/5/5/4146\">Elena Rivera Mirano</a></strong><a href=\"/5/5/4146\"> </a></em>"

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5324\">Fanny A. Garcia</a>. With an introduction by the author. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press. Fourteen out of the 16 stories in this collection were previously published as <b><i>Sandaang Damit at Iba Pang Maikling Kuwento</i></b> (A Hundred Dresses and Other Short Stories), Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, Inc, 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories in the collection were written between 1971 and 1990 and bear the burden of the conflicts prevailing during martial law and its aftermath. Included are two stories that were not in Garcia&rsquo;s earlier collection: &ldquo;Tulay sa Langit&rdquo; (Bridge to Heaven) and &ldquo;Bathala&rdquo; (God). Garcia explains that these were excluded because they were not so explicitly political as the other stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both stories, however, charted a new direction in fiction writing in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>. They were experiments in various narrative devices and were studies of the characters&rsquo; complex psyche. They foreground the plight of female characters, constructed not as types, as traditional stories tended to do, but as three-dimensional characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Tulay sa Langit,&rdquo; Garcia&rsquo;s first published story, an illegitimate daughter of a woman is derided as a prostitute by the neighbors in the slums. She begs her father to take her in after her mother dies and is treated like a slave in the father&rsquo;s house. She falls for a handsome seminarian, who is eventually ordained. With her mother dead and her seminarian gone, the embittered Mira leaves her father&rsquo;s house to try her luck in the city. She finds a job as a waitress but the proprietor makes her a mistress. He maltreats her and leaves her to starve in the toilet. As she gradually loses her sanity, specters from her past haunt her, ending with her mother waiting for her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Bathala&rdquo; is a study of the ever-changing and complex relationship between Clarissa, a stiff and straitlaced nun, and her father and her sister, Magda, a woman whose views on sex, love, and marriage revolt her. The author constructs a narrative of fierce sibling rivalry, the Electra complex, a mother&rsquo;s betrayal, a father&rsquo;s instransigent and unforgiving nature, incest, and antagonism against the institutional Church. In the end, the dying Clarissa admits that the sorrows of her life, precipitated by bad decisions, directly spring from the forbidden love for the father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rest of the stories in this anthology are variations on themes of poverty and exploitation, and the characters&rsquo; inability to rise from misery and want. &ldquo;Sandaang Damit&rdquo; (A Hundred Dresses) begins with a girl who brags of having expensive clothes for every occasion. It turns out that she is desperately clinging to this illusion in order to hide her impoverished life.

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.

				"value": "The stories in the collection were written between 1971 and 1990 and bear the burden of the conflicts prevailing during martial law and its aftermath. Included are two stories that were not in Garcia&#x2019;s earlier collection: &#x201C;Tulay sa Langit&#x201D; (Bridge to Heaven) and &#x201C;Bathala&#x201D; (God). Garcia explains that these were excluded because they were not so explicitly political as the other stories."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Both stories, however, charted a new direction in fiction writing in <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>. They were experiments in various narrative devices and were studies of the characters&#x2019; complex psyche. They foreground the plight of female characters, constructed not as types, as traditional stories tended to do, but as three-dimensional characters."

She begs her father to take her in after her mother dies and is treated like a slave in the father&#x2019;s house. She falls for a handsome seminarian, who is eventually ordained. With her mother dead and her seminarian gone, the embittered Mira leaves her father&#x2019;s house to try her luck in the city. She finds a job as a waitress but the proprietor makes her a mistress. He maltreats her and leaves her to starve in the toilet. As she gradually loses her sanity, specters from her past haunt her, ending with her mother waiting for her."

The author constructs a narrative of fierce sibling rivalry, the Electra complex, a mother&#x2019;s betrayal, a father&#x2019;s instransigent and unforgiving nature, incest, and antagonism against the institutional Church. In the end, the dying Clarissa admits that the sorrows of her life, precipitated by bad decisions, directly spring from the forbidden love for the father."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The rest of the stories in this anthology are variations on themes of poverty and exploitation, and the characters&#x2019; inability to rise from misery and want. &#x201C;Sandaang Damit&#x201D; (A Hundred Dresses) begins with a girl who brags of having expensive clothes for every occasion. It turns out that she is desperately clinging to this illusion in order to hide her impoverished life. The story proceeds to events in the life of a young student and her sweetheart and his unconditional commitment to a cause that the woman fails to understand."

The main narrative device of the story is dialogue. As the two characters, the narrator and his wife Belle, focus their attention on their neighbors, whom Belle resents, the reader begins to realize that the real focus of the story is the deterioration of the couple&rsquo;s relationship, especially their inability to communicate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Arcellana has been lauded for having perfected the &ldquo;underwritten story,&rdquo; using devices that are more characteristic of lyric poetry than of fiction.

As the two characters, the narrator and his wife Belle, focus their attention on their neighbors, whom Belle resents, the reader begins to realize that the real focus of the story is the deterioration of the couple&#x2019;s relationship, especially their inability to communicate."

Lee created a sensation in the late 1960s with short stories written in a style unfamiliar to Filipino readers&mdash;long, uninterrupted, paragraphic sentences, and a deft manipulation of time, sometimes interweaving flashbacks and flash-forwards, thus creating a complex but tight narrative in a stream-of-consciousness fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The &ldquo;Tatang&rdquo; in the book&rsquo;s title comes from his story &ldquo;Si Tatang, si Freddie, si Tandang Senyong at Iba Pang mga Tauhan ng Aking Kuwento&rdquo; (Tatang, Freddie, Old Man Senyong and Other Characters in My Story), 1971, which is about &ldquo;Tatang&rdquo; Valentin delos Santos, real-life leader of the millenarian-peasant cult Lapiang Malaya, whose members were massacred by the Philippine Constabulary in 1967. The story involves an inner story of a young writer&rsquo;s initiation into social reality as a result of the incident. In &ldquo;Dapithapon ng Isang Mesiyas&rdquo; (Requiem for a Redeemer), 1969, Dong is a poor peasant&rsquo;s son, who becomes an orphan when his father is gunned down on orders of landowner Do&ntilde;a Agueda Baltazar, and his grief-crazed mother disappears. His childhood is spent in near-prison conditions in the house of the Baltazar women, Agueda and Aurora. A virtual slave, starved and tormented by the sadistic Do&ntilde;a Aurora, Dong is driven by despair out of the mansion and into a harsher world of struggle, exploitation, betrayal, and finally, to death from pneumonia amidst the most abject condition of poverty imaginable. Although driven to despair, he never loses sight of his goal in life: to speak up for the oppressed and to liberate himself and his kind from the cycle of despair.

Editor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\">Soledad</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> S. Reyes</a>. With an introduction by the editor. Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, Inc, 1994, 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The anthology is composed of 106 poems and 51 short stories arranged chronologically, starting from 1897 with the poem &ldquo;Kasaysayan ng Isang Pag-ibig&rdquo; (History of One Love) by Gregoria de Jesus and ending in 1994 with the short story &ldquo;Nasaan si David?&rdquo; (Where Is David?) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5060\">Liwayway</a> Arceo. The bookends establish a woman&rsquo;s place&mdash;home and country&mdash;and her roles&mdash;mother, spouse, daughter, and revolutionary. Jovita N. Martinez&rsquo;s story &ldquo;Ang Silid na Mahiwaga&rdquo; (The Enchanted Room) is the inspiration for the title of the anthology; a room could be a woman&rsquo;s prison or her salvation. Martinez weaves an eerie tale of a resurrected woman who finds the courage to face her spouse and her fears of rejection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are 41 poems and 35 works of fiction selected from the American period until the 1970s. From the 1920s, poems by Vicenta C. Navarro, Simeona Decena, Virginia Ignacio, and Filomena T. Alcanar speak of love, sorrow, infidelity, and sacrifice. The 1930s include two short stories: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5013\">Rosalia L. Aguinaldo </a>creates a woman ahead of her time in &ldquo;Ay, Ay!,&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5376\">Carmen S. Herrera</a> skillfully applies the epistolary method in &ldquo;Balatkayo&rdquo; (Pretense).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5060\">Liwayway A. Arceo</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Uhaw ang Tigang na Lupa&rdquo; (Thirsty Is the Arid Land), 1944, reveals the tensions between a married couple from their young daughter&rsquo;s point of view. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5272\">Genoveva D. Edroza</a> develops an empathetic character in a model teacher who bears a secret in &ldquo;Kuwento ni Mabuti&rdquo; (Story of Mabuti), 1952. These last two stories are a departure from the traditional story, which often had a contrived happy ending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1960s are represented by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4376\">Susana C. de Guzman</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Liham&rdquo; (The Letter), about the growing solitariness of a woman in old age; Mercedes J. Jose&rsquo;s &ldquo;3 Sugat sa Kanyang Dibdib&rdquo; (3 Wounds on Her Breast) and &ldquo;Bukas ang Ikalawang Langit&rdquo; (The Second Heaven Is Open), both probing the mother-child relationship; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5222\">Rosario de Guzman-Lingat</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Isang Patunguhan&rdquo; (One Destination), where a woman chooses between taking care of an aging parent and a long-planned marriage; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ako, Hindi ang Pag-ibig Ko&rdquo; (I, Not My Love), which asks how a woman can affect a man&rsquo;s mental and psychological growth; and Carmen H. Acosta&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kandidata&rdquo; (Candidate), where a young woman&rsquo;s idealism is challenged by the reality of political corruption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poems from the same period express themes that are just as varied: a mother longing for her child who has left her in Filonila G. Abordo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sa Iyo, Aking Anak&rdquo; (To You, My Child); the importance of proper conduct during courtship in Zenaida Arcega Flores&rsquo;s &ldquo;Papanhikin ang Pagsuyo&rdquo; (Let Courtship into the House); the torment of scorned love in Natalia A. Baltazar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sa Paglulunggati&rdquo; (In Desiring); and nostalgia for a bygone era in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5076\">Nieves Baens-del Rosario</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nasaan ang Kahapon&rdquo; (Where Is Yesterday).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories from the 1970s onward show the writers&rsquo; increasing confidence and skill. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5326\">Fanny A.

The grieving Lizard takes her case to the chieftain&rsquo;s court, and the chieftain traces the original culprit back to herself.

Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This anthology of 127 stories by 53 writers from three generations spans seven decades, beginning with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5441\">Paz Latorena</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Small Key,&rdquo; 1927, and closing with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5023\">Ophelia A. Dimalanta</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;This One Legacy,&rdquo; 1993. In between are works by both major and minor voices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manlapaz&rsquo;s introduction gives a profile of women writers in English in the Philippines: they are generally of the intellectual and social elite, highly educated, gainfully employed, professionally trained, and well-traveled. The middle-class background informs and delimits their writings, but the politicization of women writers in the 1960s and 1970s and their increased self-awareness as women writers, a high point of which was the publication of <b><i>The Forbidden Fruit</i></b>, 1992, have led to an expansion of the world of their works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories and poems portray women playing various roles in various situations, and ruminating about their experiences, such as love, whether initial (Lourdes Vidal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Virgin&rdquo;), incipient (Toribia Mano&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tambourines in My Heart&rdquo;), terminated (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5034\">Merlie Alunan</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;We Kept a Jarful of Keys&rdquo;), or consummated (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5286\">Marjorie Evasco</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Elemental&rdquo;); the delights and dilemmas of parenthood and parenting (Lily Lopez-Chua&rsquo;s &ldquo;Poem for a Child about to Grow&rdquo; and Jessica Zafra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Portents&rdquo;); the relations between women, whether erotic (Rebecca Crisostomo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tender Rituals&rdquo;), sisterly (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5280\">Lina Espina-Moore</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sam-It and the Loom&rdquo;), or antagonistic (Paz Latorena&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Small Key&rdquo;); the attempt at self-definition according to one&rsquo;s own terms (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5722\">Trinidad Tarrosa-Subido</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;I, Your Wife&rdquo; and Myrna Pe&ntilde;a-Reyes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ruth Was Not Penelope&rdquo;); and the acknowledgment of one&rsquo;s cultural heritage (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5012\">Ma. Luisa B. Aguilar-Cari&ntilde;o</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Woman from the North&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The styles and modes are as varied as the subjects. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5650\">Aida Rivera-Ford</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Chieftest Mourner&rdquo; is satirical in its depiction of the hypocrisies of high society.

Several of the novel&rsquo;s characters make their first appearance here. Polotan&rsquo;s masterful handling of the elements of the short story is evident in her dynamic characterization of her protagonists&mdash;all female, all conflicted&mdash;and in well-crafted dialogue and action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tension between acknowledging desire and retaining personal control in the midst of a crucial revelation is a prominent theme in the stories. In &ldquo;The Virgin,&rdquo; the uptight and inhibited Miss Mijares, long restrained by a desk job and her family obligations, is confronted and visibly shaken by the arrival of a stranger. In &ldquo;The Trap,&rdquo; 14-year-old Elisa develops romantic feelings for her teacher, Mr Gabriel, and so discovers the pangs of adolescence. And in &ldquo;A Various Season,&rdquo; Lourdes attempts to make sense of her desires in her relationships with her husband and her newfound lover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another theme explored in the stories is entrapment. In places where the odds are against them, the characters struggle to find voice and space, and to get a hand in shaping their destinies, with uneven results. In &ldquo;This Door,&rdquo; the young woman Fe confronts death&mdash;present, imagined, and impending. In &ldquo;Cost Price,&rdquo; poverty drives Isabel, a librarian, and her love interest Joe apart. In &ldquo;The Visit,&rdquo; a married couple revisits a long-held grudge against their mother-in-law. In &ldquo;Gate,&rdquo; a memory of a past tragedy in the country bleeds into Ester&rsquo;s life in the city, where a man awaits her. &ldquo;The Face of Virtue&rdquo; details Celia&rsquo;s motives for an abortion&mdash;a form of escape&mdash;and her story of attempting escape from life in other ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The characters in <b><i>The Hand of the Enemy</i></b><i> </i>appear in stories that depict the theme of corruption against the backdrop of the city. In &ldquo;The Sounds of Sunday,&rdquo; Domingo Gorrez sinks morally as he climbs up the corporate ladder. Personal corruption expands onto the public sphere in &ldquo;The Giants,&rdquo; as the political couple, Alberto and Leonora Cosio, flaunt their riches and power before writer Carmen Reyes. In &ldquo;The Tourists,&rdquo; Paz Nuqui witnesses the degeneration of her former love interest Ernesto Bello&rsquo;s life, from one lived according to moral principles to one corrupted by power, wealth, and ambition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Six of the stories in this collection won prizes at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a>: &ldquo;The Virgin,&rdquo; first prize, 1951; &ldquo;The Trap,&rdquo; first prize, 1955; &ldquo;The Tourists,&rdquo; first prize, 1959; &ldquo;The Sounds of Sunday,&rdquo; first prize, 1960; &ldquo;The Giants,&rdquo; second prize, 1958; and &ldquo;A Various Season,&rdquo; second prize, 1962. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Maria Amparo Warren</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Villagonzalo</a>&rsquo;s picaresque novel, <b><i>Wala&rsquo;y Igsoon</i></b> (Without a Brother), 1912, contrasts two brothers who suffer through two colonial wars: the revolution against Spain and the Filipino-American war. After the Philippines&rsquo; capitulation to American aggression, social conflict becomes a main concern. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3137\">Amando Osorio</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gugma sa Magbabalak&rdquo; (The Love of a Poet), 1915, gives a modern twist to the formula of forbidden love caused by social class differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the 1920s, peasant unrest has been a dominant theme in Philippine fiction: Vicente Garces&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Sugilanon ni Iyo Simon&rdquo; (Iyo Simon&rsquo;s Story), 1925, is an allegorical tale about the origins of power structures; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5616\">Vicente Rama</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Si Amar ug si Leon&rdquo; (Amar and Leon), 1927, shows personal entanglements obfuscating legal land claims; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5423\">Pantaleon V. Kardenas</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Panimalus ni Sido&rdquo; (Sido&rsquo;s Revenge), 1935, dramatizes the fatal effects of land-grabbing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1930s, moral questions have become less cut-and-dried. &ldquo;Giagak sa Kamot ni Bathala&rdquo; (Led by the Hand of God), 1935, is a story of rape and its unpredictable consequences. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5030\">Estrella D. Alfon</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Panamilit sa Kabatan-on&rdquo; (Farewell to Youth), 1938, is a richly textured coming-of-age story of two female best friends, whose discovery of the complexities of womanhood is rendered as an epiphany. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5529\">Marcel Navarra</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ug Gianod Ako&rdquo; (And I Was Swept Away), 1937, is a landmark in modernist experimentation. Written in epistolary form, its first-person narrator addresses a &ldquo;you,&rdquo; who is his best friend. Its style is a sustained interior monologue, although it has a clear plot conflict that is character driven. The author, through his narrator, reveals his admiration for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a> and hints at his chagrin at his unappreciative readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Florentino D. Tecson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mga Kasingkasing Dagku&rdquo; (Magnanimous Hearts), 1939, unrequited love unfolds amid details of a village schoolteacher&rsquo;s life. The last piece in this volume is &ldquo;Ang Kaguol ni Banogon&rdquo; (Banogon&rsquo;s Grief), 1940, a picaresque story about a fighting cock. Its author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/4996\">Antonio Abad</a>, is also a prizewinning fictionist in Spanish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although the second volume&rsquo;s subtitle promises a coverage of 1941-2005, Cebuano writing and publishing stopped during World War II, 1941-45. Hence, the first story in this volume is dated 1947. Postwar fiction has a markedly gloomier worldview, the plot conflicts dramatizing the futility of preserving one&rsquo;s humanity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Labawng Magtutudlo&rdquo; (The Greatest Teacher), 1946, by Fausto Dugenio, uses a female first-person point of view in this story of a husband&rsquo;s serial infidelities and the betrayal of women&rsquo;s friendship. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5412\">Maria A. Kabigon</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pagtulon-an&rdquo; (Lesson), 1947, a female narrator struggles to keep her virtue intact through World War II and after.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, the plotless story starts to emerge, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5765\">Eugenio A. Viacrucis</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mga Mata sa Dagat&rdquo; (The Sea&rsquo;s Eyes), 1955, about a fisherman&rsquo;s elaborate battle with a cat; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5661\">Godofredo M. Roperos</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Usa ka Botelyang Suka&rdquo; (A Bottle of Vinegar), 1956, about a jealous husband&rsquo;s dying moments; Potenciano Ca&ntilde;izares Jr&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Naghulat sa Kangitngit&rdquo; (He Who Waits in the Dark), 1963, about a dog that witnesses Death coming to fetch its master; and &ldquo;Ang Bisita&rdquo; (The Visit), 1973, by Austregelina Espina (aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5280\">Lina Espina-Moore</a>), about a ghost and his widow who engage in intelligent and tender repartee on Christmas Eve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The classic, well-made stories, however, continue to be written, now with greater skill: in Fornarina Enemecio&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kuwentas nga Manol&rdquo; (Jasmine Necklace), 1957, a girl raised in affluence becomes estranged from her mother; in Agustino M. Pujida&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lunop&rdquo; (Flood), 1964, a disastrous storm tests the characters&rsquo; humanity. Male rite-of-passage stories are depicted in &ldquo;Ang Gidak-on sa Dagat&rdquo; (The Immensity of the Sea), 1966; and Dionisio R. Gabriel&rsquo;s comic &ldquo;Ang Tigtupo sa Dalan V. Rama&rdquo; (The Matchmaker of V. Rama Street), 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the mid-1970s onward, martial law, industrialization, and urbanization are presented as forms of institutional violence; and the countryside is no longer the romantic refuge from urban decadence. Thus, the stories are about the Mindanao war, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5639\">Gremer Chan Reyes</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Agianan Paingon sa Adlaw&rdquo; (A Trail toward the Sun), ca 1975; advertising and fishing in Marcel Navarra&rsquo;s &ldquo;Siya ug ang Iyang Tungdonon&rdquo; (Within His Compass), 1975; mining deaths in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5574\">Ricardo I. Patalinjug</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Itom nga Sabado&rdquo; (Black Saturday), ca 1984; hardened criminals in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5789\">Januar Yap</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dekada&rdquo; (Decade), 1997; and female diaspora in Maria Victoria Beltran&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria Kirschbaum&rdquo; (The Dream of Eleuteria Kirschbaum), 2005, of which the film version, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1146\"><b><i>Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria</i></b></a> (<i>The Dream of Eleuteria</i>), 2009, won local and international awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indeed, these stories hold their own as Philippine fiction, anchored on the local realities of the Cebuano-speaking population, which is spread throughout central Visayas and Mindanao. Companion anthologies are <b><i>Cebuano <strong>Poetry</strong> / <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1953\"><strong>Sugboanong Balak</strong></a> until 1940</i></b> and <b><i>Cebuano Poetry / <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1953\">Sugboanong Balak 1940-1988</a></i></b>, both published<i> </i>in<i> </i>1988; and <b><i>Dulaang Sebuwano</i></b> (Cebuano Drama), 1997. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a> and J.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5309\">Delfin Fresnosa</a>. Editor, Teresita E. Erestain. With an introduction by the editor. Manila: Far Eastern University Publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Delfin Fresnosa has been cited as being among the first Filipino writers to bring the typically marginalized into the spotlight, describing their wretched circumstances in brisk, clear prose. The 25 short stories in the collection settle on unfortunate characters, the setting shuttling between the city and the &ldquo;probinsya&rdquo; (countryside), both of which Fresnosa paints in an unforgiving light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Five of Fresnosa&rsquo;s stories deal with death: in &ldquo;Candles,&rdquo; an old man visits his wife&rsquo;s grave for the first time since her death; &ldquo;Tragedy at Lumba&rsquo;s Bend&rdquo; tells of a village reeling from the gruesome death of four local miners; &ldquo;Death of a Hero&rdquo; depicts the heartbreaking life and death of a war hero who has outlived his glory; in &ldquo;The Quick and the Dead,&rdquo; a young man at his wife&rsquo;s funeral muses on how profits are made from the dead; and in &ldquo;One Last Goodbye,&rdquo; a man nearing death opts to have himself arrested, not wanting to die alone. Two love stories in the collections are &ldquo;Lucia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mariana,&rdquo; both of which are about sexual awakening and end in heartbreak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In three stories, Fresnosa details the effects of World War II on the people caught in the cross fire. In &ldquo;Brown Girl,&rdquo; the eponymous character is spirited away by Japanese soldiers and tries to find her way back home; in &ldquo;The Accursed,&rdquo; a Japanese couple scarred by the atomic bomb are paraded as monsters in a circus. However, Fresnosa gives us a sliver of optimism in &ldquo;But Once a Year,&rdquo; where a young couple savor a single cigarette on Christmas Eve at the beginning of the Japanese occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fresnosa is also keen on focusing on the underdog. In &ldquo;Anticlimax,&rdquo; readers enter the mind of a laborer as he makes grand plans for himself, only to see these backfire on him. In &ldquo;Requiem for a Simple Man,&rdquo; readers watch from a distance as the village fool is persecuted and ultimately murdered for rescuing a girl above his station. But Fresnosa&rsquo;s skills are not limited to the grit and grime of realism; some stories have the elements of legend or the folktale. The collection&rsquo;s title story, &ldquo;Tandoz,&rdquo; tells of a farmer who steals an enchanted stone from a giant carabao and becomes the strongest man in the village. &ldquo;The Orange Tree&rdquo; has a jealous husband cutting down the orange tree his wife planted when their son disappeared, only to see it grow and bear poisonous fruit. In &rdquo;Three Strangers,&rdquo; a schoolteacher dreams of the impending doom of three strangers after a chance encounter. In &ldquo;Dove,&rdquo; a woman coping with the loss of her family is visited by a strange and mystical dove.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The stories included in this collection were published in several national magazines: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5589\"><b><i>Philippines Magazine</i></b></a>,<b> <i>Commonwealth Advocate</i></b>,<b> <i>Sunday <strong>Tribu</strong>ne Magazine</i></b>,<b> <i>Graphic</i></b>,<b> <i>Monthly Post</i></b>,<b> <i>Sunday Times Magazine</i></b>,<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5591\"><i>Philippines Free Press</i></a></b>,<b> <i>Evening News Saturday Magazine</i></b>,<i> </i>and <b><i>This Week</i></b>. Although not well known to readers today, Fresnosa wrote hundreds of stories and essays in his time, some of which are now lost. This collection reacquaints students of Philippine literature to his best stories. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Katrina del Rosario</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

In &#x201C;Anticlimax,&#x201D; readers enter the mind of a laborer as he makes grand plans for himself, only to see these backfire on him. In &#x201C;Requiem for a Simple Man,&#x201D; readers watch from a distance as the village fool is persecuted and ultimately murdered for rescuing a girl above his station. But Fresnosa&#x2019;s skills are not limited to the grit and grime of realism; some stories have the elements of legend or the folktale. The collection&#x2019;s title story, &#x201C;Tandoz,&#x201D; tells of a farmer who steals an enchanted stone from a giant carabao and becomes the strongest man in the village. &#x201C;The Orange Tree&#x201D; has a jealous husband cutting down the orange tree his wife planted when their son disappeared, only to see it grow and bear poisonous fruit. In &#x201D;Three Strangers,&#x201D; a schoolteacher dreams of the impending doom of three strangers after a chance encounter. In &#x201C;Dove,&#x201D; a woman coping with the loss of her family is visited by a strange and mystical dove."

With an introduction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a>. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this collection of 13 stories, Bayuga engages the breadth and range of the female experience in the Philippines, from a 17-year-old&rsquo;s introduction to a stratified society in Palawan to a young urban professional&rsquo;s sexual awakening in a dingy boarding house in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In her introduction, Rosario Cruz-Lucero offers a useful way of dividing the stories in terms of thematic preoccupation and corresponding formal verve. The first group, mostly told from a young character&rsquo;s point of view, consists of initiation-themed stories. In &ldquo;Rosal&rdquo; (Gardenia), a Catholic school student comes of age after she witnesses a classmate&rsquo;s tryst in a garden by the grotto of the Virgin Mary. The second group probes sexual politics. Domestic violence is at the center of &ldquo;Ang Baliw&rdquo; (The Crazed), in which an unspoken abuse on Myla by his seemingly good husband Vance is brought to the fore by the titular character&rsquo;s intrusion into their lives. The last group of stories, which are also Bayuga&rsquo;s most daring formally, examines the otherness and power of women in various guises, as babaylan, aswang, a lesbian lover, or the Muse herself. This group includes &ldquo;Pagdiwata&rdquo; (Babaylan Ritual) which charts, in a hypnotic stream-of-consciousness chant, the life of a babaylan from a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> tribe through a century of Philippine history.

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In her introduction, Rosario Cruz-Lucero offers a useful way of dividing the stories in terms of thematic preoccupation and corresponding formal verve. The first group, mostly told from a young character&#x2019;s point of view, consists of initiation-themed stories. In &#x201C;Rosal&#x201D; (Gardenia), a Catholic school student comes of age after she witnesses a classmate&#x2019;s tryst in a garden by the grotto of the Virgin Mary. The second group probes sexual politics. Domestic violence is at the center of &#x201C;Ang Baliw&#x201D; (The Crazed), in which an unspoken abuse on Myla by his seemingly good husband Vance is brought to the fore by the titular character&#x2019;s intrusion into their lives. The last group of stories, which are also Bayuga&#x2019;s most daring formally, examines the otherness and power of women in various guises, as babaylan, aswang, a lesbian lover, or the Muse herself. This group includes &#x201C;Pagdiwata&#x201D; (Babaylan Ritual) which charts, in a hypnotic stream-of-consciousness chant, the life of a babaylan from a <a href=\"/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> tribe through a century of Philippine history. Also a mother, she struggles under the weight of history, from the American period to World War II and the more recent wave of missionaries, researchers, NGOs, cultural workers, and media, who come in droves, curious about her tribe&#x2019;s &#x201C;exotic&#x201D; culture."

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemheadLIT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Published 2003. Author, Ma. Romina M. Gonzalez. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While pathos and humor are Gonzalez&rsquo;s strongest suit&mdash;in powerful evidence in this collection&rsquo;s titular and best-known piece&mdash;unmistakable social commentary also permeates the 10 stories. Whether it is on migration in &ldquo;Metropole Valentine,&rdquo; charity in &ldquo;Sanded Soles,&rdquo; class and social climbing in &ldquo;Flood,&rdquo; or workplace abuse in &ldquo;Cockroach,&rdquo; the author, a journalist, casts an unflinching eye on social realities with a cast of mostly female characters via modes that range from hard realism to the fantastic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Addressing the beloved &ldquo;you,&rdquo; the protagonist in &ldquo;Metropole Valentine&rdquo; narrates the slow breakdown of her marriage with a childhood friend after they migrate to freezing Chicago. Her growing alienation in a foreign land&mdash;aggravated by seemingly harmless quibbles about food, language, and her inability to &ldquo;outgrow&rdquo; flicks starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4357\">Sharon Cuneta</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4342\">Gabby Concepcion</a> turns into full-blown animosity when he prods her into having a baby against her will. By the story&rsquo;s end, there is triumph when she hears the beloved slip on the floor that she has, it is implied, purposely waxed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Set in an unnamed ash-covered town in the aftermath of the Pinatubo eruption, &ldquo;Sanded Soles&rdquo; pokes fun at the relief efforts and the people involved, including government officials, patrons, religious pilgrims, and the media. The story&rsquo;s points of view shift between a photographer who is tasked to document the event and a local girl who has lost her slippers. This technical innovation allows the reader to witness the harsh disconnect between the ways the victims and so-called sympathizers see the devastated landscape and lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Final, satisfying acts punctuate two stories, both fictively functioning as sound, if bizarre, repudiation of a harsh status quo. Whether it is the social-climbing ways of the child protagonist&rsquo;s mother in &ldquo;Flood&rdquo; or a sexually abusive relationship with a boss in &ldquo;Cockroach,&rdquo; Gonzalez ends the narratives with clear turns of events, signaling decisive shifts in the characters&rsquo; consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is in the middle-class love story &ldquo;Welostit&rdquo;&mdash;the collection&rsquo;s rawest, most poignant piece&mdash;where Gonzalez&rsquo;s talent as a fictionist is in abundant display. Like &ldquo;Metropole Valentine,&rdquo; &ldquo;Welostit&rdquo; is epistolary. It tracks the May-December affair from the point of view of the older woman, from its giddy beginnings to the death of their just-born baby, the &ldquo;it&rdquo; in the title. As in her other stories, the triumph of &ldquo;Welostit&rdquo; is the wealth of powerful details and compelling series of events, all told in the protagonist&rsquo;s funny, unassuming voice, which freely makes use of humor to mask an intense pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Whether the sphere is social or private, the stories in this chronologically arranged debut collection reveal the trajectory of Gonzalez&rsquo;s thematic and stylistic preoccupations, as well as the increasing deftness with which she handles her subjects. Her earliest stories, &ldquo;Till There Was You&rdquo; and &ldquo;Offertory,&rdquo; are highly playful and experimental, the former told in a hallucinogenic stream of consciousness and the latter being a modern twist on indigenous folklore.

The story&#x2019;s points of view shift between a photographer who is tasked to document the event and a local girl who has lost her slippers. This technical innovation allows the reader to witness the harsh disconnect between the ways the victims and so-called sympathizers see the devastated landscape and lives."

Like &#x201C;Metropole Valentine,&#x201D; &#x201C;Welostit&#x201D; is epistolary. It tracks the May-December affair from the point of view of the older woman, from its giddy beginnings to the death of their just-born baby, the &#x201C;it&#x201D; in the title. As in her other stories, the triumph of &#x201C;Welostit&#x201D; is the wealth of powerful details and compelling series of events, all told in the protagonist&#x2019;s funny, unassuming voice, which freely makes use of humor to mask an intense pain."

				"value": "Whether the sphere is social or private, the stories in this chronologically arranged debut collection reveal the trajectory of Gonzalez&#x2019;s thematic and stylistic preoccupations, as well as the increasing deftness with which she handles her subjects. Her earliest stories, &#x201C;Till There Was You&#x201D; and &#x201C;Offertory,&#x201D; are highly playful and experimental, the former told in a hallucinogenic stream of consciousness and the latter being a modern twist on indigenous folklore. Her latter stories, like the &#x201C;Elevator&#x201D; and &#x201C;Cockroach,&#x201D; are succinct and tongue-in-cheek.

In &ldquo;A Cake Left Out in the Rain,&rdquo; an abandoned matron falls for an American adventurer and invites him to stay in her home. She showers him with gifts, which merely build resentment in his heart as he finds his vitality smothered and sapped by her longing. More lighthearted in tone but with an undercurrent of sadness is the wonder tale &ldquo;The Dust Monster,&rdquo; which follows a neglected housewife&rsquo;s relationship with a man made of dust.

The young protagonist, Helen, must look after her crippled brother, while her widowed mother is routinely depressed. Living in a compound of discarded buses, the family relies on their friend, Simon Plaza, a magician and faith healer, to provide the occasional relief.

The theme of loss of innocence is hinted at in the title itself, which is taken from a verse in <b><i>Paradise Lost</i></b>. The bildungsroman takes place during the Japanese occupation of Manila. Beginning as children concerned only with playing and fun, Joy, her siblings, and her friends are forced to grow up in the war, to learn to survive under the most brutal conditions, and to fight back against them by whatever means necessary. Central to the novelette is the love story between Joy and Badel Mercado, but the latter gets caught deeper and deeper in the violence and with the guerrillas, and farther and farther away from Joy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>A Wilderness of Sweets</i></b><i> </i>can be said to belong to the early post-World War II movement of Philippine literature in English, whose indoctrination into New Criticism was expanded by existentialist introspection.

Among the most anthologized stories in the collection are &#x201C;Zita,&#x201D; a girl&#x2019;s initiation into love and heartache; &#x201C;Flower Shop,&#x201D; ostensibly a description of a day at a flower shop but actually an expos&#xE9; of a socialite&#x2019;s character; &#x201C;At Last This Fragrance,&#x201D; a detached intern&#x2019;s reawakening to human feeling and company; and &#x201C;Dahong Palay&#x201D; (Rice Leaves), usually cited as an example of the use of local color, a development in the genre that came along with the emergence of Anderson, and others. &#x201C;Convict&#x2019;s Twilight&#x201D; and &#x201C;How They Transferred the Convicts to Davao&#x201D; depict life in the penal colony and inmates sympathetically."
