The audience responds to the literary piece according to their aesthetic, emotional, and intellectual experiences and preferences; their need for entertainment; and their standards for moral satisfaction. These factors depend on the historical, cultural, and ethical milieu of the audience; thus one literary work may evoke varied responses from audiences of different circumstances, places, and times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A literary work affects its audience by means of emotional, intellectual, and sensuous stimulation. The reactive function of the audience is either passive or participative. Reading a book is a relatively passive function. Responding to an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic</a> bard&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chanting</a> or singing by speaking words of encouragement, filling in gaps in the storytelling, dancing, singing in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, and the like are participative functions. Technology and tradition interplay in creating audience response. Technology could determine certain changes in the nature of audience response, as what happened with the introduction of the technologies of print and film. Tradition, however, maintains its influence on audiences in that they rely on established conventions and notions of literary forms and materials, and aesthetic and moral values in responding to a work of literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The Philippine audience of literature has undergone a series of transformations since precolonial times. Indigenous literature began with oral stories, songs, and riddles. This oral literature generally involved an &ldquo;inter-creation&rdquo; between the artist and the audience, as illustrated by the complex storytelling tradition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, who have a rich oral literature. In the Manobo custom, the gathering of relatives for harvest is a typical occasion for storytelling. The performance usually begins at dusk, often lasting the whole night until dawn. At some point in the event, the storyteller volunteers, with nonverbal signals and in an indirect manner, to perform. The ritual opens with the ceremonial extinguishing of the candle, the better for the audience to imagine the story taking place right before their eyes, and to generate expectation and receptivity. The storyteller has to prepare process and method well, for the stamina required is prodigious. To ensure that audience interest does not flag, that listeners do not doze off midway into the all-night performance, the storyteller uses a whole array of vocal and linguistic devices. Viewpoints may shift from the omniscient to the third person, from the audience&rsquo;s viewpoint (the second-person you) to the first-person plural (we). And then the storyteller may also use his/her own viewpoint, which may reveal his/her attitude. These are ways by which the storyteller arouses the audience&rsquo;s feeling of moral satisfaction and amusement or sympathy for a character. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The storyteller uses linguistic devices such as shifting tenses, paraphrasing, and parallelism to indicate the peak points in the narrative. Changes of pace, which may be a shift from terse dialogue to an involved, dramatic dialogue, or a condensation of time at the appropriate points, may be used as well. To mark the denouement, the storyteller speeds up the pace, using rhetorical questions following one after the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All these methods are meant to elicit immediate audience response. These responses are abundant: the appearance of the hero provokes cheering, and the villain is roundly chided. Narrative flow is helped along when the audience interjects (&ldquo;Hurry, think of something fast!&rdquo;) or marks turning points (&ldquo;Aha, take note of that.&rdquo;). They themselves may formulate metaphors: &ldquo;Perhaps the tinkling of the bells is like the humming of the bees!&rdquo; The audience, as moral jurors, keeps up, commenting on the actions and decisions of the main characters: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ever agree to marry that man, Princess!&rdquo; The storyteller may be encouraged by these verbal responses or may even be compelled to cut short a scene that the audience finds objectionable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thus, audience and storyteller are truly inter-creators. There is all the leeway for the individual performer&rsquo;s creativity in fitting traditional material for a particular living audience. The storyteller, in effect, recreates literature alongside an actively participating audience&mdash;modifying, highlighting, adapting, adding, and omitting portions of the story in front of an audience that signifies their approval or disapproval. Later on, members of the audience themselves become the storytellers by orally transmitting the narrative. The story then is kept alive by means of oral recitation through generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the epic, other literary forms in the precolonial period were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballads</a>, proverbs, and riddles. Many of these materials were derived from the epics, illustrating the genre&rsquo;s centrality in the people&rsquo;s lives. The preservation of these forms was largely oral through collective memory. Though a native syllabary existed and literacy was common, writing was used mainly for correspondence. Indigenous religion, governance, and literature were founded on oral tradition, which had been and would be sustained and developed over centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tribal lore served to foster equilibrium and balance, and to heal social fractures, weaving a close-knit consciousness of community. The communality of experience made for an audience that was uniformly familiar with the themes, situations, activities, and objects mentioned. There were no distinctions between young or old, men or women as audience; this unitary character made for one culture for all. The rules of the art form were universally known, easily enabling the audience to be critics. Moral judgment in these stories was bestowed by the community, and it was always the final, correct one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The introduction of the printing press in 1593, during the early decades of the Spanish colonial regime, eventually led to the development of literature as a written form. Reading a written work, aside from or instead of listening to a spoken work, became a new literary experience for the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest books printed in the Philippines were religious texts, such as catechisms and spiritual guides, written by Spanish priests in the various Philippine languages. They were meant not for local audiences but for the foreign clergy to aid them in their mission of proselytization. In 1610, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5598\">Tomas Pinpin</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Librong Pagaaralan nang manga Tagalog nang Uicang Castila</i></b><i> </i>(A Book for the Tagalog to Study the Spanish Language) appeared, which signaled a turning point for Philippine audiences and writers. It was the first published book written by a native. As its title indicates, Pinpin&rsquo;s pioneering work was intended for a specific audience and for a specific purpose. It also suggests that there was an emerging print culture among the local audience in the early 17th century: that there was a native readership and a native market for books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But apparently this print culture was slow to develop. Two decades after the Jesuits published the Visayan <b><i>Doctrina Christiana</i></b> (Christian Doctrine) in 1610, Fr Juan de Medina, in <b><i>Historia de la Orden de S. Agustin de estas Islas Filipinas</i></b> (History of the Augustinian Order in the Philippine Islands), 1630, ridiculed the idea of the <i>indio</i> (Christianized natives) buying a book or, if they did, of their overcoming their laziness to read it. By the 1650s, however, it seemed that reading was more common among the natives, or at least among those in Manila, whom Fr Domingo Fernandez Navarrete described as owners of religious books and whose &ldquo;docility&rdquo; was due to their fondness for reading these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">That early 17th-century audiences did not readily develop a reading habit had to do with the issue of access. On the one hand, books were expensive items at the time, not priced within the means of the general public. On the other, while many books were written in the various Philippine languages, they used the Roman alphabet, which was still alien to most natives, if they could read at all. But perhaps the more crucial issue was the dominance of oral tradition, and this persisted well into the 19th century, until the end of Spanish rule. In literature, print did not displace oral tradition; rather, both means of transmission coexisted. Some literary works were circulated in both print and oral forms, and this allowed the audience a more participative role, one that evoked the inter-creation dynamic between artist and audience of precolonial literature. This also made for a more transformative effect in the literary text itself and among the audience. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a> serves as a salient example in this respect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pasyon, a verse narrative of the Passion of Christ, is a written form. The original version was authored by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5056\">Gaspar Aquino de Bele</a>n in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, published in 1703. So popular was this work that it saw multiple reprintings in the 18th and 19th centuries. It also inspired many other versions not only in Tagalog but also in various Philippine languages. The pasyon eventually came to be adapted for performance: read aloud or chanted as the <i>pabasa</i> during the Lenten season.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most popular version of the pasyon was a text of anonymous authorship, first published in 1814, which came to be known as <b><i><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g Pilapil</i></b> (The Passion by Pilapil) or <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong>Pasyong </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong></i></b> (The Passion of Genesis). While its common name attributes a certain authority to <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5594\">Fr Mariano Pilapil</a>, one of the several priests who edited the original text, its authorship involved a collective effort among its audience. In the process of oral transmission, through innumerable copy transfers with varying degrees of faithfulness, through generations of performers&rsquo; innovations and adaptations, the <b><i>Pasyong Pilapil</i> </b>came to reflect the popular consciousness that claimed it as its own. The audience effected subtle changes in its text even as Church authorities imposed orthodox doctrine from time to time. The fact that printed works had to seek an imprimatur gave the friars an amount of control over the written material, but this they did not or could not always wield effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While pasyon works evolved through the years, as in the case of the <b><i>Pasyong Pilapil</i></b>, the form did have some measure of textual stability, given that it was written and printed. It was the pabasa that was the more fluid form, it being orally transmitted and open to the improvisations and interpretations of its performers as well as its audience. The pabasa involved a listening, not a reading, audience. It was not so bound to the accuracy of the text, for they did not have to be literate as the chanters or readers were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pabasa was traditionally held at the <i>bisita</i>, an ordinary structure put up to accommodate a large number of people. Food, celebration, and fiesta were very much integral components of the event. Liquor and fish were served to chanters, participants, and passersby alike. Truly a social as much as a religious occasion, the pabasa alarmed priests who railed against the drinking, courtship, and trysting that accompanied this religious ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the 18th and 19th centuries, a customary practice was to have the pasyon sung as part of the funeral ritual. A 1917 report describes how, in Batangas, pasyon stanzas were exchanged between <i>harana</i> (serenade) revelers and the <i>dalaga</i> (damsel) being courted. A related practice is the <b>tapatan</b>, which is a riddling contest, or a contest of wits, regarding pabasa text interpretation and character identification. The popularity of this activity is indicated by the practice of peasants simultaneously toiling in the fields and memorizing the pasyon excerpts to get the better of their tapatan rival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sung a cappella, pasyon chanting usually involves two groups responding antiphonally to each other, with several chanters ready to take up from where others leave off to take refreshments. One popular style of singing is the <b>tagulaylay</b>, which is a holdover from the precolonial style of chanting, characterized by extended trills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chanters, readers, and audience-participants usually take part in the ritual because of a <i>panata</i> (vow) of thanksgiving, petition, or devotion. The event is one of worship and edification. It also serves as entertainment, with the live chanting recalling traditional performances of the epic. For the audience, the pabasa is a continuation of the oral epic&rsquo;s tradition of communal context. The pasyon story itself has taken on an epic quality, with Jesus as the mythic hero who undergoes various tests and triumphs in the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish colonial period, the pasyon served as a channel for religious instruction. The series of <b>aral</b> (moral), which came at certain parts of the narration, drove home to the audience that people could not decree their own future and that they were constantly at death&rsquo;s door. The faithful were urged to mistrust wealth, power, and praise, these being the things of this world which would not last. Since the only permanent reality was God, obedience to God unto death was the paramount principle (Javellana 1988).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Quite clearly, the pasyon and its aral served the ideological intent of Spanish colonialism to mold good colonials, with the presentation of ecclesiastical and civil authorities as God&rsquo;s living representatives on Filipino earth. The aral would emphasize that enriching or even educating oneself was immoral. Yet the very same pasyon came to be a moral guide in ways that the colonial dispensation never intended. Jesus became a character alive for Filipinos. Dilemmas and decisions were aligned with the values of <i>damayan</i> (mutual aid) and the virtue of <i>loob</i> (inner strength). Moreover, what the audience internalized was Christ as unlettered, poor, and humble; the Pharisees and <i>tagabayan</i> (town or city people), who were His accusers, were of the learned, rich, and powerful class. In the end, through suffering, temptation, and death, it was Christ&rsquo;s loob that prevailed over arrogance and power. Reynaldo Ileto, in <b><i>Pasyon and Revolution</i></b>, 1979, asserts that for the oppressed and exploited Filipinos, the pasyon bestowed a coherent meaning to the daily suffering and conflict that was their lot. It was loob that would win out in the end; <i>liwanag</i> (light, transcendence) was historically inevitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Providing a contrast to the pasyon, in terms of audience, participation, and effect, was the <b>manual de urbanidad</b> (conduct book), such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5218\">Modesto de Castro</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1823\"><b><i>Pag Susulatan nang Dalauang Binibini na si Urbana at ni Feliza</i></b></a><i> </i>(Letters between Two Maidens Urbana and Feliza), 1864. It had a smaller audience because it required a more literate readership, which, in all likelihood, consisted predominantly of town dwellers with colonial aspirations. This epistolary exchange between two sisters&mdash;Urbana from a <i>beaterio</i> (religious house) in Manila, and Feliza from their hometown in Paombong, Bulacan&mdash;covers the code of conduct of the times concerning birth, death and courtship rituals, marital love, and the children&rsquo;s upbringing. It is quite explicitly moralist and evokes a style of living elevated to a social art. Such topics as table manners, the proper attitude for games and play, rules in writing correspondence, and even etiquette for visiting, are dealt with in exacting detail. The author, through Urbana, advises the reader to refrain from rowdy behavior, swinging the feet, or crossing the legs. When their father dies, Urbana reminds Feliza that life is a <i>pangingibang-bayan</i> (exile), and death is a coming home to God, for human hardships are put to an end when the person is rescued from the suffering that is life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In all these, the author stands as the sole judge of morality. Moral intentions, motivations, and attitudes are dissected minutely, reflecting a view of every person as inherently evil, deriving from the Catholic doctrine of the original sin. The audience&rsquo;s role, meanwhile, is to be obediently responsive. The conduct book&rsquo;s audience, consisting of the religious tagabayan who could afford books and learning, followed standards of eloquence and meaning determined by such religious materials as the sermon, <b>ejemplo</b> or didactic narrative, and lives of saints. These same materials are the source of the biblical examples, metaphors, and rhetorical devices used in <b><i><strong>Urbana at Feliza</strong></i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Place and character, however, come much nearer to audience than those in the pasyon. Paombong is a small rural town; the beaterio is in Manila. The situations of the small-town characters, their concerns and hopes, are sketched in recognizable outlines. Moreover, because both audience and author are united by a common religious practice and convention, there is a minimum of persuasiveness on the author&rsquo;s part. We can assume that the audience easily reached a satisfying moral identification with Urbana and Feliza&rsquo;s positive characters, even as they might not have been able to keep to its constrictions in real life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Urbana at Feliza</i></b><i> </i>was read well into the first quarter of the 20th century. However, with the passing years, the audience&rsquo;s moral identification with it weakened. The book was rooted on such assumptions as the moral leadership of the Church, the entrenchment of male authority and colonial state law, and the feudal context of individual freedom. All these assumptions eventually lost ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 19th century, as dissatisfaction with Spanish rule escalated, Filipino authors began to use literature for political ends. This added a new aspect to the relationship between the artist and audience. Given the strict censorship at the time, authors who were critical of the state or Church had to mask their statements and sentiments in acceptable forms and in figurative language. The audience, in turn, had to read deliberately for implied meanings and messages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Such was the case with the metrical romance <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><b><i> at Laura</i></b></a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltaza</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">r</a> aka Balagtas, first published in 1838. It was an adventure-love story in the mold of traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>; yet&nbsp;its subtle deviations from the conventions of the metrical romance allowed for alternative readings. Balagtas might have suggested this himself in his preface &ldquo;Sa Babasa Nito&rdquo; (To the Reader), in which he described the contents of the book as seemingly &ldquo;green and immature&rdquo; but its meat being savory to the discriminating reader. Thus the fantastic characters, plot, and settings of <b><i><strong><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></strong></i></b><i> </i>have come to be read as allegorical. In the late 19th century, it was determined to be a depiction of the sufferings of the Filipino people under the oppressive Spanish colonial regime. This reading continues to be maintained and propagated to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The propaganda movement&mdash;represented by persons like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5393\">Emilio Jacinto</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>&mdash;molded Tagalog into an infinitely more elastic and flexible expression of Philippine thought and feeling. Using as initial models the traditional <b>awit</b> and <b>korido</b> (terms for the metrical romance), the ejemplo, and even the sermon, they made the language bear the weight of extended satire, polemic, and political agitation. All these forms they used for an audience that they had to move not only to tears and laughter but also to armed revolution. The audience responded accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Late in the 19th century, print and oral culture worked together in the transmission of reformist and revolutionary literature. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b> (Touch Me Not), which was published in Berlin in 1887, had a print run of 2,000 copies that reached only about a thousand readers in the Philippines. Yet it spawned much oral and written literature that carried various interpretations of its text. These did not differ too widely from the spirit and political intent of the book. Even as the <b><i>Noli</i></b> targeted a specific audience, composed of the Spanish-speaking <i>ilustrado</i> (educated native) and the liberal Spaniards, it refused to be contained; it reached a much wider audience that already was of a different class and language.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The literature of the Philippine Revolution&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\">essay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><i>kundiman</i></a> (love song), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a>&mdash;involved a more direct author-audience interaction despite class differences. The authors were mostly from the ilustrado class; they were educated, highly literate, and fluent in Spanish, whereas the mass audience spoke in their own local languages. Yet the political situation at the time and their common patriotic aspirations provided the necessity and direction for the interaction between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 20th century, under the American administration, the introduction of English through the public education system and the conventions of writing in this language caused some changes once again among authors, the audience, and their relationship with one another. By the 1920s, there was a new elite in Philippine society: educated Filipinos fluent primarily in English, Western-oriented, and alienated from the native heritage. English became the medium of high literature that was meant for the elite audience, while the Philippine languages were used for low, popular material that catered to the masses. Eventually, another kind of audience emerged: the literary establishment made up of authors in English, editors, critics, teachers of literary history and criticism. It was they who presided over the development of taste and literary value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>&rsquo;s poetry and other experimental works illustrate an aspect of the writing for the elite audience, particularly those steeped in Western expressionism, modern art, and avant-gardism. Villa&rsquo;s avowal of &ldquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; placed literature on a pedestal, beyond the reach of the mass audience. To appreciate his work, and that of other authors who subscribed to the dictum, one not only had to be literate but also specifically literate in English and in the Anglo-American literary tradition. This requirement limited the size of the audience. Countering this is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5799\">Rafael Zulueta da Costa</a>&rsquo;s popular poem <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1894\">&ldquo;Like the Molave,&rdquo;</a> 1940, which was often chosen by teachers for oral interpretation in schools. The traditional Spanish rhythms and the prosaic, declarative style of the poem were something a broad audience could easily relate to and appreciate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The school of thought represented by Villa was not unchallenged. In fact, there was a great debate on it, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5464\">Salvador P. Lopez</a> as the leading voice against Villa&rsquo;s view of literature. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1623\"><b><i>Literature and Society</i></b></a>, 1940, which won at the Commonwealth Literary Contest, Lopez called for a literature that was socially and politically relevant. He advocated social consciousness in literature and the engagement of writers with their audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, oblivious of the debate, the mass audience carried on reading popular fare, mainly the fiction featured in the magazines published in various Philippine languages. The literary establishment found such material escapist, formulaic, melodramatic&mdash;in essence, unartistic. But it was what the general public could and chose to engage with. Magazines were bought because of the featured fiction, and magazines sold in massive numbers weekly throughout the country. After World War II, it was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><b>komiks</b></a> or comic book that became the mass audience&rsquo;s favorite source of entertaining reading. The komiks featured illustrated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short stories</a> and serialized novels in every possible subgenre imaginable: from fantasy to love story, from historical drama to family saga, from detective and crime fiction to science fiction. All the komiks publications were in Tagalog; yet people from all over the country read them. The publications even served as an alternative source of language instruction for the non-Tagalog. The komiks were phenomenally popular, and their appeal lasted for decades. It was estimated that, in the 1980s, komiks were read every week by some 15-18 million Filipinos or around one-third of the Philippine population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The popular magazines and the komiks<i> </i>encouraged reader participation by way of its letters-to-the-editor section. Letters could significantly determine the direction that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1536\">Philippine literature</a> would take. In the early 1950s, for instance, there was a brief attempt by magazine writers to experiment with local fiction by adding touches deriving from Western modernism. Coming from a background of James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway, many writers of this period deliberately tried to infuse angst and ennui in the native experience. However, although such stories were replete with details of local color, such as <span class=\"body-italics\" style=\"font-style:italic\">bagoong</span> (fermented shrimp paste), <i>tinapa </i>(smoked fish), and <span class=\"body-italics\" style=\"font-style:italic\">tuba</span> (coconut wine), the readers complained in their letters that the characters&rsquo; fictive experiences were alien to them. One reader lamented of one such story that it was &ldquo;wa man gayuy lami&rdquo; (quite dry). Another complained that the story bored him and gave him a headache, instead of exciting him. The editor of that magazine soon afterward decided to revive more of the stock adventure, sentimental, and detective stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The production of popular literature necessarily if not naturally involves making such concessions to the tastes and temperaments of the readers, not unlike how the storytellers of precolonial times modified their narratives to better appeal to their audience. To that same end, writers adjust elements in their works, be it in the development of the characters or the pace of the plot or even the conclusion itself. Some writers also take up writing in the popular forms of the day to reach a wider audience. In the early 20th century, for instance, journalists, poets, and writers of traditional literary forms shifted to writing novels, as the new genre was eagerly received by the mass audience and gaining a strong following among them. This was the case, too, with novelists who pursued writing for the komiks, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5177\">Gregorio C. Coching</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5249\">Clodualdo del Mundo</a>, when the demand for the form was growing in the early 1950s. Later in the century, some komiks writers would likewise shift to writing Tagalog romance novels, which were the bestsellers of the day. Among them were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5146\">Nerissa Cabral</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5513\">Helen Meriz</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, there were writers of social realist fiction, such as those now identified with the group called the &ldquo;Agos sa Disyerto&rdquo; and individual writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5272\">Genoveva Edroza-Matute</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>, who were writing for the audience of the mass-circulation <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b> magazine. A heightened political consciousness caused a shift from English to the local language, Pilipino in particular, though the authors and their readers were based in the academe. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\">Rolando S. Tinio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5357\">Gelacio Guillermo</a> exemplified this shift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the martial law years (1972-81), the publishing of literary works was limited by the economic difficulties of the time and the censorship enforced by the Marcos dictatorship. It was radio that was the leading source nationwide of information and entertainment. Evidently, even in the 20th century, oral tradition continued to hold sway over the Philippine audience. This tradition, though, had evolved with the times with the use of modern technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the EDSA Revolt of 1986, with the renewal of the freedom of the press and speech, and the revived nationalism and optimism among Filipinos, there was a burst of literary activity and an ensuing steady growth in publishing. In 1986, for instance, the total number of books published in the Philippines was at 804 titles. By 1995, this figure had risen to 1,229, of which 199 were literary titles. In literature, it was the genres of the essay and the novel that saw numerous new books produced by both established and up-and-coming authors. Significant as the growth in book publishing was, however, the total number of titles in 1995 is actually quite paltry considering that the population at that time was at around 70 million, and the literacy rate was at 94.5 percent. The reality was that the audience generally still preferred to listen to the radio and, more increasingly, watch television rather than read books or other printed matter. In stark contrast to 1,229 books published in 1995 is the number of television sets owned by Filipinos at the time, which was at 3.3 million units.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Electronic media not only challenged print publications in terms of being preferred by the audience, but it also changed written literature in itself as far as oral and visual elements were concerned. With their sensibilities transformed by television and film, the audience responded better to literary works that had an oral quality and a visual impact. This required literary writers to employ sharper and more dramatic devices in composing dialogue, describing place, and handling time. Writers knew well that electronic media had a wider reach than print both geographically and demographically. Thus some of them also wrote for television and film, aside from continuing to author works for print publication. Among those were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5209\">Jose Dalisay Jr</a>, who is primarily a fictionist but has also written screenplays for movies; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>, who wrote children&rsquo;s literature but also authored scripts for television; and Lualhati Bautista, who writes fiction as well as movie and television scripts. Some writers shifted altogether to careers in film, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4312\">Carlo J. Caparas</a> who became a movie director, producer, and scriptwriter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In more recent years, a new form of technology has been reshaping the communication landscape. <span style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Introduced in the Philippines in the 1990s and developing rapidly since, the Internet is changing the way literature is presented to and received by the audience. Online technology is allowing authors an immediacy in disseminating their works and a potential to reach a wider audience. Publishing online bypasses the constraints of deadlines and distribution, often lengthy and limited, involved in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/74/1564\">print publishing</a>. Furthermore, blogs and social networking sites&mdash;with their capacity to generate feedback in the form of comments, likes, or posts&mdash;enable author and audience to interact and even inter-create in real time, as they once did in traditional oral literature. It might well be said that the Internet is democratizing contemporary literature by providing a medium for authors and audiences from all over the country to engage in the production and consumption of literature. This trend is thus decentralizing publishing, which has been traditionally concentrated in Metro Manila and undertaken by institutions connected with if not actually of the literary establishment. Or at least the Internet has the potential for such democratization. Access to online technology is still largely limited to urban areas and to the higher classes of society who have the educational background and economic means to use the technology. It is early days yet to determine the actual and lasting impact of the Internet on Philippine literature, but that it is transforming authors and audiences is inarguable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Meanwhile, book publishing has stood its ground with the coming of the Internet. In fact, it has continued to grow, with 5,518 titles produced nationwide in 2007. Yet readership has been on the decline. Readership surveys conducted by the National Book Development Board reveal that the readership of books, newspapers, magazines, and comics among Filipino adults steadily declined from 94 percent in 2003, to 92 percent in 2007, to 88 percent in 2012. However, the 2012 survey also showed that people exposed to such stimuli as the television, malls, and the Internet were more likely to read non-schoolbooks than those who were not. Also, the surveys showed that more Filipino children were beginning to read at an earlier age: the figures of those who began reading non-schoolbooks at age six and below rose by 3 percent in 2003, 4 percent in 2007, and 9 percent in 2012. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The nature of readership today is changing according to the cultural, social, and technological circumstances of the times. But then transformation indeed marks the nature and history of the Philippine audience. Throughout the centuries, it has adapted and adjusted to its milieu; it has been affected by and has affected the literature that it calls its own. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Victoria S.

Indigenous literature began with oral stories, songs, and riddles. This oral literature generally involved an &#x201C;inter-creation&#x201D; between the artist and the audience, as illustrated by the complex storytelling tradition of the <a href=\"/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, who have a rich oral literature. In the Manobo custom, the gathering of relatives for harvest is a typical occasion for storytelling. The performance usually begins at dusk, often lasting the whole night until dawn. At some point in the event, the storyteller volunteers, with nonverbal signals and in an indirect manner, to perform. The ritual opens with the ceremonial extinguishing of the candle, the better for the audience to imagine the story taking place right before their eyes, and to generate expectation and receptivity. The storyteller has to prepare process and method well, for the stamina required is prodigious. To ensure that audience interest does not flag, that listeners do not doze off midway into the all-night performance, the storyteller uses a whole array of vocal and linguistic devices. Viewpoints may shift from the omniscient to the third person, from the audience&#x2019;s viewpoint (the second-person you) to the first-person plural (we). And then the storyteller may also use his/her own viewpoint, which may reveal his/her attitude. These are ways by which the storyteller arouses the audience&#x2019;s feeling of moral satisfaction and amusement or sympathy for a character. </span>"

It was the first published book written by a native. As its title indicates, Pinpin&#x2019;s pioneering work was intended for a specific audience and for a specific purpose. It also suggests that there was an emerging print culture among the local audience in the early 17th century: that there was a native readership and a native market for books."

By the 1650s, however, it seemed that reading was more common among the natives, or at least among those in Manila, whom Fr Domingo Fernandez Navarrete described as owners of religious books and whose &#x201C;docility&#x201D; was due to their fondness for reading these."

On the one hand, books were expensive items at the time, not priced within the means of the general public. On the other, while many books were written in the various Philippine languages, they used the Roman alphabet, which was still alien to most natives, if they could read at all. But perhaps the more crucial issue was the dominance of oral tradition, and this persisted well into the 19th century, until the end of Spanish rule. In literature, print did not displace oral tradition; rather, both means of transmission coexisted. Some literary works were circulated in both print and oral forms, and this allowed the audience a more participative role, one that evoked the inter-creation dynamic between artist and audience of precolonial literature. This also made for a more transformative effect in the literary text itself and among the audience. The <a href=\"/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a> serves as a salient example in this respect."

Food, celebration, and fiesta were very much integral components of the event. Liquor and fish were served to chanters, participants, and passersby alike. Truly a social as much as a religious occasion, the pabasa alarmed priests who railed against the drinking, courtship, and trysting that accompanied this religious ritual."

				"value": "During the 18th and 19th centuries, a customary practice was to have the pasyon sung as part of the funeral ritual. A 1917 report describes how, in Batangas, pasyon stanzas were exchanged between <i>harana</i> (serenade) revelers and the <i>dalaga</i> (damsel) being courted. A related practice is the <b>tapatan</b>, which is a riddling contest, or a contest of wits, regarding pabasa text interpretation and character identification. The popularity of this activity is indicated by the practice of peasants simultaneously toiling in the fields and memorizing the pasyon excerpts to get the better of their tapatan rival."

One popular style of singing is the <b>tagulaylay</b>, which is a holdover from the precolonial style of chanting, characterized by extended trills."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Chanters, readers, and audience-participants usually take part in the ritual because of a <i>panata</i> (vow) of thanksgiving, petition, or devotion. The event is one of worship and edification. It also serves as entertainment, with the live chanting recalling traditional performances of the epic. For the audience, the pabasa is a continuation of the oral epic&#x2019;s tradition of communal context. The pasyon story itself has taken on an epic quality, with Jesus as the mythic hero who undergoes various tests and triumphs in the end."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "During the Spanish colonial period, the pasyon served as a channel for religious instruction. The series of <b>aral</b> (moral), which came at certain parts of the narration, drove home to the audience that people could not decree their own future and that they were constantly at death&#x2019;s door. The faithful were urged to mistrust wealth, power, and praise, these being the things of this world which would not last. Since the only permanent reality was God, obedience to God unto death was the paramount principle (Javellana 1988)."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Quite clearly, the pasyon and its aral served the ideological intent of Spanish colonialism to mold good colonials, with the presentation of ecclesiastical and civil authorities as God&#x2019;s living representatives on Filipino earth. The aral would emphasize that enriching or even educating oneself was immoral. Yet the very same pasyon came to be a moral guide in ways that the colonial dispensation never intended. Jesus became a character alive for Filipinos. Dilemmas and decisions were aligned with the values of <i>damayan</i> (mutual aid) and the virtue of <i>loob</i> (inner strength). Moreover, what the audience internalized was Christ as unlettered, poor, and humble; the Pharisees and <i>tagabayan</i> (town or city people), who were His accusers, were of the learned, rich, and powerful class. In the end, through suffering, temptation, and death, it was Christ&#x2019;s loob that prevailed over arrogance and power. Reynaldo Ileto, in <b><i>Pasyon and Revolution</i></b>, 1979, asserts that for the oppressed and exploited Filipinos, the pasyon bestowed a coherent meaning to the daily suffering and conflict that was their lot. It was loob that would win out in the end; <i>liwanag</i> (light, transcendence) was historically inevitable."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Providing a contrast to the pasyon, in terms of audience, participation, and effect, was the <b>manual de urbanidad</b> (conduct book), such as <a href=\"/9/9/5218\">Modesto de Castro</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/9/77/1823\"><b><i>Pag Susulatan nang Dalauang Binibini na si Urbana at ni Feliza</i></b></a><i> </i>(Letters between Two Maidens Urbana and Feliza), 1864. It had a smaller audience because it required a more literate readership, which, in all likelihood, consisted predominantly of town dwellers with colonial aspirations. This epistolary exchange between two sisters&#x2014;Urbana from a <i>beaterio</i> (religious house) in Manila, and Feliza from their hometown in Paombong, Bulacan&#x2014;covers the code of conduct of the times concerning birth, death and courtship rituals, marital love, and the children&#x2019;s upbringing. It is quite explicitly moralist and evokes a style of living elevated to a social art. Such topics as table manners, the proper attitude for games and play, rules in writing correspondence, and even etiquette for visiting, are dealt with in exacting detail. The author, through Urbana, advises the reader to refrain from rowdy behavior, swinging the feet, or crossing the legs. When their father dies, Urbana reminds Feliza that life is a <i>pangingibang-bayan</i> (exile), and death is a coming home to God, for human hardships are put to an end when the person is rescued from the suffering that is life."

Moral intentions, motivations, and attitudes are dissected minutely, reflecting a view of every person as inherently evil, deriving from the Catholic doctrine of the original sin. The audience&#x2019;s role, meanwhile, is to be obediently responsive. The conduct book&#x2019;s audience, consisting of the religious tagabayan who could afford books and learning, followed standards of eloquence and meaning determined by such religious materials as the sermon, <b>ejemplo</b> or didactic narrative, and lives of saints. These same materials are the source of the biblical examples, metaphors, and rhetorical devices used in <b><i><strong>Urbana at Feliza</strong></i></b>."

The situations of the small-town characters, their concerns and hopes, are sketched in recognizable outlines. Moreover, because both audience and author are united by a common religious practice and convention, there is a minimum of persuasiveness on the author&#x2019;s part. We can assume that the audience easily reached a satisfying moral identification with Urbana and Feliza&#x2019;s positive characters, even as they might not have been able to keep to its constrictions in real life."

However, with the passing years, the audience&#x2019;s moral identification with it weakened. The book was rooted on such assumptions as the moral leadership of the Church, the entrenchment of male authority and colonial state law, and the feudal context of individual freedom. All these assumptions eventually lost ground."
			},

This added a new aspect to the relationship between the artist and audience. Given the strict censorship at the time, authors who were critical of the state or Church had to mask their statements and sentiments in acceptable forms and in figurative language. The audience, in turn, had to read deliberately for implied meanings and messages."

It was an adventure-love story in the mold of traditional <a href=\"/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>; yet&#xA0;its subtle deviations from the conventions of the metrical romance allowed for alternative readings. Balagtas might have suggested this himself in his preface &#x201C;Sa Babasa Nito&#x201D; (To the Reader), in which he described the contents of the book as seemingly &#x201C;green and immature&#x201D; but its meat being savory to the discriminating reader. Thus the fantastic characters, plot, and settings of <b><i><strong><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></strong></i></b><i> </i>have come to be read as allegorical. In the late 19th century, it was determined to be a depiction of the sufferings of the Filipino people under the oppressive Spanish colonial regime. This reading continues to be maintained and propagated to this day."

Using as initial models the traditional <b>awit</b> and <b>korido</b> (terms for the metrical romance), the ejemplo, and even the sermon, they made the language bear the weight of extended satire, polemic, and political agitation. All these forms they used for an audience that they had to move not only to tears and laughter but also to armed revolution. The audience responded accordingly."

Yet it spawned much oral and written literature that carried various interpretations of its text. These did not differ too widely from the spirit and political intent of the book. Even as the <b><i>Noli</i></b> targeted a specific audience, composed of the Spanish-speaking <i>ilustrado</i> (educated native) and the liberal Spaniards, it refused to be contained; it reached a much wider audience that already was of a different class and language."

The authors were mostly from the ilustrado class; they were educated, highly literate, and fluent in Spanish, whereas the mass audience spoke in their own local languages.

By the 1920s, there was a new elite in Philippine society: educated Filipinos fluent primarily in English, Western-oriented, and alienated from the native heritage. English became the medium of high literature that was meant for the elite audience, while the Philippine languages were used for low, popular material that catered to the masses. Eventually, another kind of audience emerged: the literary establishment made up of authors in English, editors, critics, teachers of literary history and criticism. It was they who presided over the development of taste and literary value."

Villa&#x2019;s avowal of &#x201C;art for art&#x2019;s sake&#x201D; placed literature on a pedestal, beyond the reach of the mass audience. To appreciate his work, and that of other authors who subscribed to the dictum, one not only had to be literate but also specifically literate in English and in the Anglo-American literary tradition. This requirement limited the size of the audience. Countering this is <a href=\"/9/9/5799\">Rafael Zulueta da Costa</a>&#x2019;s popular poem <a href=\"/9/78/1894\">&#x201C;Like the Molave,&#x201D;</a> 1940, which was often chosen by teachers for oral interpretation in schools. The traditional Spanish rhythms and the prosaic, declarative style of the poem were something a broad audience could easily relate to and appreciate."

In <a href=\"/9/76/1623\"><b><i>Literature and Society</i></b></a>, 1940, which won at the Commonwealth Literary Contest, Lopez called for a literature that was socially and politically relevant. He advocated social consciousness in literature and the engagement of writers with their audience."

The literary establishment found such material escapist, formulaic, melodramatic&#x2014;in essence, unartistic. But it was what the general public could and chose to engage with. Magazines were bought because of the featured fiction, and magazines sold in massive numbers weekly throughout the country. After World War II, it was the <a href=\"/9/73/1554\"><b>komiks</b></a> or comic book that became the mass audience&#x2019;s favorite source of entertaining reading. The komiks featured illustrated <a href=\"/9/73/1560\">short stories</a> and serialized novels in every possible subgenre imaginable: from fantasy to love story, from historical drama to family saga, from detective and crime fiction to science fiction. All the komiks publications were in Tagalog; yet people from all over the country read them. The publications even served as an alternative source of language instruction for the non-Tagalog. The komiks were phenomenally popular, and their appeal lasted for decades. It was estimated that, in the 1980s, komiks were read every week by some 15-18 million Filipinos or around one-third of the Philippine population."

Letters could significantly determine the direction that <a href=\"/9/72/1536\">Philippine literature</a> would take. In the early 1950s, for instance, there was a brief attempt by magazine writers to experiment with local fiction by adding touches deriving from Western modernism. Coming from a background of James Joyce and Ernest Hemingway, many writers of this period deliberately tried to infuse angst and ennui in the native experience. However, although such stories were replete with details of local color, such as <span class=\"body-italics\" style=\"font-style:italic\">bagoong</span> (fermented shrimp paste), <i>tinapa </i>(smoked fish), and <span class=\"body-italics\" style=\"font-style:italic\">tuba</span> (coconut wine), the readers complained in their letters that the characters&#x2019; fictive experiences were alien to them. One reader lamented of one such story that it was &#x201C;wa man gayuy lami&#x201D; (quite dry). Another complained that the story bored him and gave him a headache, instead of exciting him. The editor of that magazine soon afterward decided to revive more of the stock adventure, sentimental, and detective stories."

To that same end, writers adjust elements in their works, be it in the development of the characters or the pace of the plot or even the conclusion itself. Some writers also take up writing in the popular forms of the day to reach a wider audience. In the early 20th century, for instance, journalists, poets, and writers of traditional literary forms shifted to writing novels, as the new genre was eagerly received by the mass audience and gaining a strong following among them. This was the case, too, with novelists who pursued writing for the komiks, such as <a href=\"/9/9/5177\">Gregorio C. Coching</a> and <a href=\"/9/9/5249\">Clodualdo del Mundo</a>, when the demand for the form was growing in the early 1950s. Later in the century, some komiks writers would likewise shift to writing Tagalog romance novels, which were the bestsellers of the day.

In 1986, for instance, the total number of books published in the Philippines was at 804 titles. By 1995, this figure had risen to 1,229, of which 199 were literary titles. In literature, it was the genres of the essay and the novel that saw numerous new books produced by both established and up-and-coming authors. Significant as the growth in book publishing was, however, the total number of titles in 1995 is actually quite paltry considering that the population at that time was at around 70 million, and the literacy rate was at 94.5 percent. The reality was that the audience generally still preferred to listen to the radio and, more increasingly, watch television rather than read books or other printed matter. In stark contrast to 1,229 books published in 1995 is the number of television sets owned by Filipinos at the time, which was at 3.3 million units."

With their sensibilities transformed by television and film, the audience responded better to literary works that had an oral quality and a visual impact. This required literary writers to employ sharper and more dramatic devices in composing dialogue, describing place, and handling time. Writers knew well that electronic media had a wider reach than print both geographically and demographically. Thus some of them also wrote for television and film, aside from continuing to author works for print publication. Among those were <a href=\"/9/9/5209\">Jose Dalisay Jr</a>, who is primarily a fictionist but has also written screenplays for movies; <a href=\"/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>, who wrote children&#x2019;s literature but also authored scripts for television; and Lualhati Bautista, who writes fiction as well as movie and television scripts.

Online technology is allowing authors an immediacy in disseminating their works and a potential to reach a wider audience. Publishing online bypasses the constraints of deadlines and distribution, often lengthy and limited, involved in <a href=\"/9/74/1564\">print publishing</a>. Furthermore, blogs and social networking sites&#x2014;with their capacity to generate feedback in the form of comments, likes, or posts&#x2014;enable author and audience to interact and even inter-create in real time, as they once did in traditional oral literature. It might well be said that the Internet is democratizing contemporary literature by providing a medium for authors and audiences from all over the country to engage in the production and consumption of literature. This trend is thus decentralizing publishing, which has been traditionally concentrated in Metro Manila and undertaken by institutions connected with if not actually of the literary establishment. Or at least the Internet has the potential for such democratization. Access to online technology is still largely limited to urban areas and to the higher classes of society who have the educational background and economic means to use the technology. It is early days yet to determine the actual and lasting impact of the Internet on Philippine literature, but that it is transforming authors and audiences is inarguable.</span>"

Readership surveys conducted by the National Book Development Board reveal that the readership of books, newspapers, magazines, and comics among Filipino adults steadily declined from 94 percent in 2003, to 92 percent in 2007, to 88 percent in 2012. However, the 2012 survey also showed that people exposed to such stimuli as the television, malls, and the Internet were more likely to read non-schoolbooks than those who were not. Also, the surveys showed that more Filipino children were beginning to read at an earlier age: the figures of those who began reading non-schoolbooks at age six and below rose by 3 percent in 2003, 4 percent in 2007, and 9 percent in 2012. </span>"

Contests can be &ldquo;heaven-sent boons&rdquo; for writers, offering not only recognition and acclaim but financial rewards that encourage literary production (Groyon 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, it has been noted that any institutionalized system of awards and grants is bound to be &ldquo;contaminated by national politics, the formation of literary cliques &hellip; and the ideologies of the period&rdquo; (Anderson 2013). In the Philippines, charges of patronage, cliquism, and parochialism remain common and persistent (Santiago 2012, 52-53). The impression that literary awards privilege friendships and personalities rather than merit became more pronounced and entrenched in the 1990s, as writers became inextricably tied to universities and institutions while becoming further isolated from the rest of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even so, at their best, awards like those annually given by the Carlos Palanca Foundation and grants from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4566\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> help sustain writing activity in the country by rewarding quality work and financing worthwhile literary efforts, like workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first recorded literary contest in the Philippines was launched by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5449\">Liceo Artistico-Literario</a> in 1879. It had two categories, one for <i>peninsulares</i> (Spaniards born in Spain) and <i>insulares</i> (Spaniards born in the Philippines), and another for mestizos and natives. The competition was for prose and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1832\">&ldquo;A la Juventud Filipina&rdquo;</a> (To the Filipino Youth), a poem by then 18-year-old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>, won first prize. He was awarded a silver quill. In 1880, according to his diploma, Rizal was again awarded the first prize for his play <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/532\"><b><i>El Consejo de los Dioses</i></b></a> (The Council of the Gods).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"critics\" name=\"critics\"></a>Critics&rsquo;s Choices</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One form of literary recognition was the critic&rsquo;s list. One of the earliest is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;honor roll&rdquo; of what he thought were the best Filipino short stories written in English, which were then being published in magazines, such as the <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b>, and weekend supplements of newspapers such as the <b><i>Philippines Herald</i></b> and the <strong><i>Tribu</i></strong><b><i>ne</i></b>. Villa began his annual selections in 1926, although the first of his lists to be published was that for 1927. Inclusion in Villa&rsquo;s list was said to constitute an announcement of a writer&rsquo;s &ldquo;arrival&rdquo; in Philippine literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A move to identify the best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> short stories began in 1927 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5249\">Clodualdo del Mundo</a> in his column Ang Tao sa Parolang Ginto (The Person in the Golden Lighthouse). In 1932, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/4998\">Alejandro G. Abadilla</a>, in his column Mga Talaang Bughaw (Blue Lists), started his own lists of what he judged to be the best stories of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"state\" name=\"state\"></a>State Awards</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Both Villa and Abadilla championed aestheticism and the avant-garde. State-sponsored awards, in contrast, seem to operate on a different set of criteria. A counterpoint to Villa and Abadilla was the Commonwealth Literary Contests, aka Commonwealth Literary Awards, in 1940, which rewarded works that &ldquo;deal with the social and economic problems of the individual and of society over and above those that are merely concerned with fantasy or mysticism or vain speculation&rdquo; (Arguilla, Nedruda, and Agoncillo 1940, 128). According to the published rules, preferred were entries &ldquo;with native characters, utilizing native settings, customs, traditions&rdquo; (130). It was proposed by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5590\">Philippine Writers&nbsp;League</a>, which was established in 1939 (Ordo&ntilde;ez 1989, 31). Then Commonwealth president Manuel L. Quezon, supposedly enticed by the idea of a literary competition &ldquo;heralding the beginning of the project of nation&rdquo; (Laurel 2003, 602), took up the suggestion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of this nationalist rhetoric, the awards were swept by works that could be described as socially conscious in orientation and patriotic in theme. In the English division, the award for poetry was won by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5799\">R. Zulueta da Costa</a> for the collection <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1894\">&ldquo;Like the Molave.&rdquo;</a> The title poem was inspired by a<i> </i>speech of Quezon&rsquo;s, where he envisioned a people growing like the Philippine hardwood molave, &ldquo;strong and resilient, rising on the hillside, unafraid of the raging flood, the lightning or the storm, confident of its own strength&rdquo; (Ordo&ntilde;ez 1989, 25). Villa&rsquo;s apolitical collection &ldquo;Poems by Doveglion&rdquo;<i> </i>won only an honorable mention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Similarly, the top prize for the novel went to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5443\">Juan C. Laya</a>&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1746\"><strong>His Native Soil</strong></a></em>,&nbsp;whose theme is cultural conflict. Winning<i> </i>an honorable mention was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5344\">N. V. M. Gonzalez&rsquo;</a>s &ldquo;The Winds of April,&rdquo; which offers a glimpse of how peddlers, immigrant workers, and homesteaders lived in the country&rsquo;s hinterlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5061\">Manuel Arguilla</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2020\"><b><i>How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife</i></b></a>, 1940, won the prize for the short story. Portraits of the troubled social landscape of the time, some of Arguilla&rsquo;s works went<i> </i>beyond depicting local color; his characters included peasant organizers moving among the grassroots and strikers in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The award for the essay went to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5464\">Salvador P. Lopez</a> for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1623\"><b><i>Literature and Society</i></b></a>, 1940. His essay &ldquo;Proletarian Literature: A Definition,&rdquo; a pioneering work in Philippine literary theory, helped spark the enduring debate on the social function of art and literature in Philippine society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Tagalog division, none of the eight novels entered was awarded the top prize. Honorable mention was given to the following novelists: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5307\">Lazaro Francisco</a> for <em><strong>Singsing na Pangkasal</strong></em><i>&nbsp;</i>(Wedding Ring), which was cited for its narrative style<i> </i>and for going beyond the melodramas of the period; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5013\">Rosalia Aguinaldo</a> for <strong><em>Kalayaan&nbsp;</em></strong>(Freedom); and<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5692\">Antonio Sempio</a><i> </i>for<i> </i><em><strong>Nayong Manggagawa</strong></em><i>&nbsp;</i>(Workers&rsquo; Village), which was a love story set amidst the harassment and eviction of the urban poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Spanish division, the winners were as follows: for the novel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/4996\">Antonio M. Abad</a>&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1717\"><strong>El Campeon</strong></a></em>&nbsp;(The Champion); for the essay, Abad&rsquo;s &ldquo;De la Hora Transeunte&rdquo; (Of the Temporary Hour) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5069\">Pedro Aunario</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pugna de Lenguas&rdquo; (The Battle of Languages); for poetry, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5083\">Jesus Balmori</a>&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1908\"><strong>Mi Casa de Nipa</strong></a></em>&nbsp;(My Nipa House); for the drama, Abad&rsquo;s <b><i>Dagohoy</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The works awarded &ldquo;tried to distance themselves from the colonizer and seek a road independent of the United States&rdquo; (Laurel 2003, 629). Their winning reflected the approval of the government in forwarding this gesture of independence. This similar dynamic would be seen again in the Centennial Literary Prize in 1998, to mark the centenary of the country&rsquo;s independence from Spanish colonial rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Commonwealth had earlier launched a national biography contest on Jose Rizal in 1938. Of the 12 entries submitted, only one was in Spanish, <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1582\"><strong>Biografia de Rizal</strong></a></em><i>&nbsp;</i>(Biography of Rizal) by<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5557\">Rafael Palma</a>, which won first<i> </i>prize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, two other state-sponsored awards for literature were established. These awards, too, were tied to national goals. The Pro Patria Awards for Literature was given in 1961 on the centenary of Jose Rizal to honor those who promote and advance &ldquo;national progress&rdquo; and &ldquo;love of country and civic citizenship responsibility&rdquo; (Florentino 1963, 74). It consisted of presidential citations, given to N. V. M. Gonzalez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a>, and Jose Garcia Villa, for their overall contributions, and a literary contest, in which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5788\">Leopoldo Yabes</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5252\">Ricaredo Demetillo</a> won second and third prizes, respectively.

On 15 May 1973, the proclamation was amended by Proclamation 1144 which provided for the creation of a National Artists Awards Committee mandated to draft the guidelines in choosing awardees and to administer the conferment of the awards. The signing of the second proclamation also declared two literary writers as National Artists: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5372\">Amado V.

Since the time of Quezon, there has not been &ldquo;any single event in Philippine history &hellip; when the state has shown itself to be taking literature seriously&rdquo; than with the launch of the contest by the National Centennial Commission (Laurel 2003, 602). Opened to all nationals from Southeast Asia, the contest offered generous prize money at one million pesos for the grand winner, and 750,000 pesos and 500,000 pesos for the second and third placers, respectively. The categories&rsquo; emphasis on length also echoed the ambition of the Commonwealth contest: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a> (at least 250 pages), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic poetry</a> (at least 1,000 lines), full-length drama in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a> genre (at least three acts), essay (at least 250 pages), and screenplay (at least 105 minutes running time).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The theme&mdash;&ldquo;ideas and events of the 1896 Philippine Revolution&rdquo;&mdash;also harkened back to the Commonwealth Literary Contests&rsquo; nationalist imperative, enacted at a momentous point in the country&rsquo;s history. The three winners in the English novel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5319\">Eric Gamalinda</a>&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1778\"><strong>My Sad Republic</strong></a></em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5541\">Charlson Ong</a>&rsquo;s <em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1732\">An Embarrassment of Riches</a></strong></em>,&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5794\">Alfred A.

While the pieces published in the magazines might be generally influenced by the aesthetics of the incumbent literary editor and therefore those in contention for the prizes, a panel, usually made up of veteran writers, is constituted to determine the outcome of the contest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The annual short story contest of the <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b><i> </i>can be traced back to 1929, when it named Jose Garcia Villa&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mir-i-nisa&rdquo; as the best short story of the year. It revived the annual short story competition in 1949, and until 1971, it drew entries from the country&rsquo;s leading writers in English. Among the winners are &ldquo;Guardia de Honor&rdquo; by Nick Joaquin, 1949; &ldquo;A Wind over the Earth&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5131\">Gregorio Brillantes</a>, 1954; &ldquo;The Day the Dancers Came&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5686\">Bienvenido Santos</a>, 1960; &ldquo;The Last Caucus&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5535\">Wilfrido Nolledo</a>, 1963; &ldquo;Serenade&rdquo; by N.

The contest was revived in 1992 and was renamed Free Press Literary Awards. A poetry category was introduced in 1992, and an award for the essay, in 1993.

M. Fres-Felix, and Timothy Montes for the essay. Prior to the magazine&rsquo;s folding in 2012, the Free Press Literary Awards had been widely sought-after, second only to the Palanca in prestige and unmatched for prize money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">During martial law, <b><i>Focus</i></b> was the only magazine publishing literary works. It attracted writers to its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a>, poetry, and essay competitions, which ran from 1973 to 1983.

Resil Mojares won for &ldquo;A Sickness in the Town,&rdquo; 1970, and Federico Licsi Espino Jr for &ldquo;Bituin sa Palasingsingan&rdquo; (Star on the Ring Finger), 1971. The magazine was closed when martial law was declared in 1972, with its editors hauled to jail. Reformatted as the <b><i>Philippines Graphic</i></b>, the magazine revived the award in 1990. It was renamed the Nick Joaquin Literary Awards in 2004, the year of Joaquin&rsquo;s death. Joaquin had been its literary editor. It began to name a &ldquo;Poet of the Year&rdquo; in 2013.

Two committees were formed: one to choose the board of judges and the other to organize the awards ceremonies. It was decided that the ceremonies be held on 2 Apr, or Balagtas Day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The winning works were chosen from poems published in magazines and newspapers.

In the English division, an Appreciation Award was shared among Nick Nicolas Jr for &ldquo;Theater, Films and Others: A Compendium of Critical Reviews,&rdquo; Wilhelmina Q. Ramas for<i> </i>&ldquo;Sugbuanon Theater: From Sotto to Rodriguez and Kabahar,&rdquo; and<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\">Soledad S.

The English category was dropped, and an all-Filipino rule was adopted. The categories were poetry, short story, one-act play, three-act play, dance libretto (one-act dance drama), and the full-length musical drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The winners in the poetry category that year were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5647\">Fidel Rillo</a> for &ldquo;Musa Insurekta&rdquo; (Insurgent Muse), first prize; Teo Antonio for &ldquo;Cespora Personata at Iba Pang Pagbubulay-bulay&rdquo; (Cespora Personata and Other Ruminations), second prize; and<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5632\">Danton Remoto</a> for &ldquo;Kuwaderno&rdquo; (Notebook), third prize. In the short story category, the winners were Reynaldo Duque for &ldquo;Ang Gamu-gamo sa Lampara ni Julio Madarang&rdquo; (The Firefly about Julio Madarang&rsquo;s Lamp), first prize; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5365\">Chit Balmaceda-Gutierrez</a> for &ldquo;Kulas,&rdquo; second prize; and Tomas F.

The critical essay category on the different arts<i> </i>was instituted a year later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The winning poems and stories in the Gawad CCP para sa Panitikan have been published in <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b>, the Cultural Center&rsquo;s literary journal, while the critical works have appeared in <b><i>Kultura</i></b>, the CCP magazine for critical essays. The Gawad CCP para sa Panitikan was revived in 2008 after being discontinued in 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Gawad CCP para sa Sining, which is the &ldquo;highest award given by the CCP to Filipino artists and cultural workers&rdquo; for a lifetime&rsquo;s achievement, also awards writers (Alba 2004). First given in 1977, it was given yearly until 1994. It was revived 10 years later in 2004, and in 1996 became the Gawad CCP para sa Sining Pantanghalan to reflect the CCP&rsquo;s &ldquo;new thrust&rdquo; as a center for the performing arts rather than a coordinating center for all arts. Awardees in literature fall under three categories&mdash;namely, writers or groups who have differentiated themselves in the art form, those who have made exceptional contributions to the culture of their regions, and cultural workers who helped spur and enrich art forms or Philippine culture in general. Over the years, awardees include N. V. M. Gonzalez, F. Sionil Jose, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen Fernandez</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5183\">Gilda Cordero-Fernando</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"other\" name=\"other\"></a>Other Institutions</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary awards have also been given by private entities, schools and universities, and organizations that are not necessarily directly linked to literature or publishing. In the 20th century, the earliest literary prize established was the Premio Zobel, instituted on 22 Jul 1920 to promote the study of the Spanish language and creative writing in Spanish on literature, science, and history. Established by Don Enrique Zobel de Ayala, the award is administered by the Academia Filipina. From 1985 until its expiration in 2001, it was sponsored by Ayala&rsquo;s grandchildren Georgina and Alejandro Padilla y Zobel and, later, great-grandchild Diana MacCrohon y Padilla. In its 81-year existence, the award was only temporarily suspended from 1942 to 1951 and from 1967 to 1973.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The history of the Premio Zobel is recounted by Lourdes Brillantes in <b><i>80 A&ntilde;os del Premio Zobel</i></b> (80 Years of the Premio Zobel), 2000, and its expanded English edition <b><i>81 Years of the Premio Zobel</i></b>, 2006. The books feature biographical notes on the winners and excerpts from their works. At first, the Premio Zobel was a purely literary contest, writers being awarded for specific works. From 1975 on, however, it was awarded to Filipinos, whether writers, historians, teachers, publishers, or statesmen, for a lifetime&rsquo;s work of contributing to or enhancing Filipino-Spanish culture. The awardees were given, aside from the cash prizes, a bronze medal with the founder&rsquo;s image, and a certificate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Spanish Embassy launched in 1985 the Premio Manuel Bernabe to drum up interest in research and creative writing on Filipino-Spanish topics. Works in Spanish that won first prize were &ldquo;Raices Hispanicas de la Cocina Filipina&rdquo;<i> </i>(Hispanic Roots of the Filipino Cuisine), 1985, by Francisco Castillo; &ldquo;Los Colonizadores de Filipinas ante los Ojos de Claro M. Recto y Manuel Bernabe&rdquo; (The Colonizers of the Philippines before the Eyes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5627\">Claro M. Recto</a> and Manuel Bernabe), 1990, by Edgardo Tiamson; and <b><i>Filipinas a Cristobal Colon</i></b> (The Philippines to Cristobal Colon), 1992, by E. Tiamson. The award no longer exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most prestigious literary award at present is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\">Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a>, established in 1950 and sponsored by the Carlos Palanca Foundation. This award is eagerly sought by writers, both veterans and newcomers, because it supposedly represents recognition of literary skill and merit by established writers and the critics or scholars who comprise the various panels of judges. Also, in view of the periodic dearth of publishing outlets for written works in this country, the cash awards provide an added incentive. It continues to enjoy increasing popularity, the number of entries submitted for competition increasing year after year. The short story and poetry categories attract the lion&rsquo;s share of entries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were two divisions (English and Tagalog) and one category (short story) in 1950. The following categories were subsequently added to both divisions: the one-act play in 1954; poetry in 1963; the essay in 1979; the novel in 1980. More categories were introduced later: the children&rsquo;s story in English and Tagalog in 1989; the teleplay in English and Tagalog in 1990; the screenplay in English and Tagalog in 1994; the Kabataan essay in English and Tagalog in 1998; futuristic fiction in English and Filipino in 2000; and poetry for children in English and Filipino in 2009. In 1997, Ilocano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, and Hiligaynon divisions were introduced, but with each having only the short story category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The competition in the novel category took place once every three years and, later, once every two years. The Palanca Hall of Fame was instituted in 1995. It is given to writers who have won five first prizes. The annual awarding ceremony is held on the first of September. Winners receive cash prizes and certificates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the winning works are the following: the short stories &ldquo;Clay&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5328\">Juan T. Gatbonton</a> and &ldquo;Ang Kuwento ni Mabuti&rdquo; (The Story of Mabuti) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5272\">Genoveva Edroza-Matute</a>, 1951; the poetry collections <em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1952\">A Stun of Jewels</a></strong></em>&nbsp;by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5043\">Carlos Angeles</a> and &ldquo;Alamat ng Pasig&rdquo;<i> </i>(Legend of Pasig) by<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5519\">Fernando B. Monleon</a>, 1963; the essays &ldquo;This City is in the Heart&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5273\">Anacleta Encarnacion</a> and &ldquo;Mga Talinhaga sa Panahon ng Krisis&rdquo; (Metaphor in a Time of Crisis) by Virgilio S. Almario, 1979; the novels <em><strong>Silapulapu and the Zebut Brothers</strong></em>&nbsp;by Lemmie Suaco-Brillo and <em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1736\">Gapo&nbsp;</a></strong></em>(Olongapo) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>, 1980; and the short stories for children &ldquo;The Great Green Grove of Ato&rdquo; by Gretchen B. Ira and &ldquo;Pamana ng Bundok&rdquo; (The Mountain&rsquo;s Legacy) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5495\">Edgardo B. Maranan</a>, 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Palanca has had a positive impact on the overall literary publishing landscape in the country. The awarded works are anthologized by the Carlos Palanca Foundation. Aside from this, more than 500 works that have won a Palanca have been published by academic and commercial presses. Specifically, its addition of the novel category in 1980 &ldquo;had an effect on the production of novels (in Filipino and English) &hellip; [which] served as a new incentive for authors to produce full-length fiction (Jurilla 2011, 11, 15).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, despite its stature, it is widely believed that winning the Palanca is rarely, if ever, based on merit alone (Palanca 2013, 86). Seen as a rite of passage for young writers, the awards are said to &ldquo;exist in order to make writers,&rdquo; not necessarily to recognize the best work submitted that year. This has mainly been attributed to the judging system, described as &ldquo;flawed&rdquo; and arbitrary, prone to the kind of literary patronage that the awards are themselves charged with cultivating, given the country&rsquo;s small, tight-knit community of writers (87). Its limited and largely local importance has also been noted, as it carries very little weight outside the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even so, the Palanca continues to retain prestige even if other awards of comparable scope, like the Free Press Literary Awards and the Nick Joaquin Literary Awards, have handed out bigger monetary incentives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The Southeast Asian Writers Award, or S.E.A. Write Award, was established in 1979 to give recognition to writers from ASEAN. Based in Thailand and organized by the Mandarin Oriental, Thai Airways International Public Co. Ltd, and the Italthai Group of Companies, it is presided over by the Thai royalty. Among the Filipino recipients of the award are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5201\">Jolico Cuadra</a>, 1979; Nick Joaquin, 1980; Gregorio Brillantes, 1981; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5192\">Adrian Cristoba</a>l, 1982; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5727\">Edilberto Tiempo</a>, 1983; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5522\">Virginia Moreno</a>, 1984; Ricaredo Demetillo, 1985; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5700\">Jose Ma.

Hernandez Resource Center (AVHRC) and the Gapas Foundation Inc (GPI), began sponsoring literary contests to encourage writing from the grassroots. The AVHRC is an institution devoted to workers&rsquo; issues, whereas the GPI is oriented toward the peasantry. The awards in their literary competitions are called Gawad Amado V. Hernandez and the Gantimpalang Ani, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The Gawad Amado V. Hernandez, named after the person who was both a literary figure and a working-class hero in his time, has two categories: one for <i>manggagawa </i>(workers) and the other for<i> makamanggagawa </i>(pro-worker writers),<i> </i>who are usually middle-class or urban Filipinos having worker sympathies. Works submitted are expected to reflect the problems and struggles, the demands and aspirations of the Filipino working class, expressed in poetry, short story, essay, and skit or short play. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Gantimpalang Ani was initiated in 1987. Its aim is to encourage creative or imaginative writing among the peasants in the Philippine rural areas and also among the advocates working for peasant concerns. There are two categories: one for the <i>magbubukid</i> (peasant writers) and another for the <i>makamagbubukid</i> (pro-peasant writers). To encourage new writers to join, veterans who have won national literary or music awards are disqualified from competing. The genres in the Gantimpalang Ani are poetry, essay, short story, songwriting, and drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the poetry category, first division, the earliest winners of the Gantimpalang Ani were Lorenzo Quilit Sr for &ldquo;Bigkis ay Lakas at Iba Pang Tula&rdquo; (Unity is Strength and Other Poems), first prize; Rolando Murillo for &ldquo;Dalawang Tula&rdquo; (Two Poems), second prize; and Gregorio Urian for &ldquo;Kaming Magsasaka at Iba Pang Tula&rdquo;<i> </i>(We Farmers and Other Poems), third prize. Winners in the second divison<i> </i>were Edgar Agunday for &ldquo;Tanikala at Iba Pang Tula&rdquo; (Chains and Other Poems), first prize; Rowena Festin for &ldquo;Mga Talatang Hinango mula sa Pinitak at Pilapil&rdquo;<i> </i>(Paragraphs Taken from the Canal and Dike), second prize; and Desiderio<i> </i>Mondelo for &ldquo;Mga Tula ng Paggunita&rdquo; (Poems of Reminiscences). Honorable mention went to Noel Dumlao for &ldquo;Angil ng Gapas at Iba Pang Tula&rdquo; (Growl of the Cutter and Other Poems), Rolendes Fabi for &ldquo;Marami Pang Hahawanin, Ka Juan at Iba Pang Tula&rdquo;<i> </i>(There Is More to Clear, Ka Juan and Other Poems), and<i> </i>Jimmuel Costelo Naval for &ldquo;Limang Tula para sa Tumana&rdquo; (Five Poems for the Highland).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">There were no winners in the short story category, first division. The second division winners were Bernardo Bernardino for &ldquo;Isang Mahal na Araw&rdquo; (One Holiday), first prize; and Ruth Lopez for &ldquo;Uha! Uha! Uha!,&rdquo; second prize.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the essay, first division, the prize was shared by Mario Marten for &ldquo;Hindi Lahat ng Pangarap ay Kabiguan ang Hinaharap&rdquo; (Not All Dreams Meet Disappointment), Annie Parro for &ldquo;Dahil sa Pagkakaisa&rdquo; (Because of Unity), and Jaime Triunfante for &ldquo;Ang Pakikibaka ni Mang Simeon&rdquo; (Mang Simeon&rsquo;s Battles). The second division co-winners were Merla Ferreras for &ldquo;Hindi pa rin Matubos ng Dugo, Luha at Pawis&rdquo; (Blood, Tears, and Sweat Cannot Be Redeemed) and Bernadette Oblena for &ldquo;Dugong Buhay&rdquo; (Living Blood).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The prizes for song were given only to the second division writers. These were Fred Villareal and Fiel for &ldquo;Butong Binhi&rdquo; (Seed), first prize; Mon Ayco for &ldquo;Habilin&rdquo; (Things Entrusted), second prize; and Mon Ayco for &ldquo;Nasaan Kayo?&rdquo; (Where Are You?), third prize. Honorable mention went to Mon Ayco for &ldquo;Maliliit na mga Langgam&rdquo; (Tiny Ants), Mon Ayco for &ldquo;Tayo nang Maglakbay&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Go and Travel), and Hilarion Gallaron, Rannie Reyes, and Felipe Rondina Jr. for &ldquo;Hinukay na Lupa&rdquo; (Excavated Earth).

There were six categories: poetry, novel or short story, and essay in English and Filipino, and drama or film script in Filipino. The top prize per category was 200,000 pesos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">UP, through its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5450\">Institute of Creative Writing</a>, also annually hands out the Madrigal-Gonzalez Best First Book Award to books of first-time authors published within a two-year period. It alternates between English and Filipino works. The 50,000-peso prize money is provided by the Madrigal Gonzalez family. The institute also gave out the N. V. M. Gonzalez Short Story Award from 2000 to 2005. Works published within the preceding year were eligible, and the grand prize was awarded 50,000 pesos. Its first winner was Carmen Aquino Sarmiento&rsquo;s <em><strong>Good Intentions 101: SY 72-73</strong></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside Manila, competitions that gave out awards were started by organizations, schools, and other institutions that aim to reinvigorate writing in the regions. In some cases, they helped sustain what grants from the CCP and the NCCA started in the late 1980s. These include the following: in Bicol, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5604\">Premio Tomas Arejola;</a> in Eastern Visayas, the NCCA-funded Eduardo Makabenta Sr. Poetry Contest of Leyte Normal University, the DYVL Siday Contest sponsored by a radio station, the Chito S.

This award is co-sponsored by the Balagtas Bicentennial Commission. The awardees are chosen through a nomination process involving other writers, writers&rsquo; organizations, and institutions. Recipients of the award receive a trophy called &ldquo;Ang Manunulat,&rdquo; designed and carved by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3432\">Manuel Baldemor</a>, a Filipino artist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the awardees are the following: Carmen Guerrero-Nakpil for the essay in English, Francisco Arcellana for fiction in English, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5060\">Liwayway Arceo</a> for fiction in Filipino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5106\">Teo Baylen</a> for poetry in Filipino, Genoveva Edroza-Matute for the short story in Filipino, Wilfrido Ma.

Qualified to join in this poetry competition are participants in the organization&rsquo;s poetry workshop called &ldquo;Hasaan&rdquo; (Whetstone) and writers who have not yet won in any national poetry competition. Among the winners of the Gawad Galian are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5132\">Rofel Brion</a>, Donato Mejia Alvarez, Danton Remoto, Luz B.

In the mid-1970s, GUMIL solicited the help of Ilocano entrepreneurs, politicians, and overseas workers for the sponsorship of literary contests. GUMIL-Hawaii has been holding an annual short story and poetry writing contest, and publishes the winners in anthologies. It began giving the Pedro Bucaneg Award in 1978 to any male Ilocano writer who has made a significant contribution to Ilocano literature. The Governor Roquito Ablan Awards for Iloko Literature (GRAAFIL) are given yearly to winners of a poetry and short story competition. A private business organization, the Economy Tourist and Travel Inc, owned by Ilocano couple Mr and Mrs Rene Ragunton, began sponsoring an annual short story and poetry writing contest, adding the novel as a category in 1991. A group of Ilocano friends living in the United States pooled resources to sponsor a poetry writing contest for amateur writers. The winners are bestowed the Tumbaga-Galizia-Tadena Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"grants\" name=\"grants\"></a>Grants and Fellowships</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Writing grants were instituted in the late 1980s to encourage writers to finish works in progress, in their language of competence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1961 and 1962, the Stonehill Fellowship for the Filipino Novel in English, administered by the Philippine Center of International PEN and funded by Harry Stonehill, awarded a cash prize for a novel or a novel in progress. The recipients were Nick Joaquin for <b><i>The Woman Who Had Two Navels</i></b>, 1961, and Kerima Polotan for <b><i>The Hand of the Enemy</i></b>, 1962.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1980, the Philippine Writers&rsquo; Foundation (PWF) chose 21 grant applications from a field of 131. The total amount involved was 149,000 pesos. The first recipients of the PWF writing grants include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5667\">Alfrredo Navarro Salanga</a> for <em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1709\">The Birthing of Hannibal Valdez</a></strong></em>,&nbsp;novel, published in 1984; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5096\">Nazario Bas</a> for &ldquo;Ang Nahanaw sa Kampilan&rdquo;<i> </i>(Those Who Died by the Cutlass), novel; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a> for &ldquo;Ang Kasaysayan bilang Kathang Isip&rdquo;<i> </i>(History as Fiction), essay;<i> </i>Juanito Marcella<i> </i>for 10 short stories in Hiligaynon; Pedro Ricarte for &ldquo;Limampung Maikling Tulang Liriko&rdquo;<i> </i>(Fifty Short Lyric Poems); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5552\">Agustin Pagusara</a> for &ldquo;The Filipino Soul,&rdquo; essay;<i> </i>Reynaldo Duque for &ldquo;Candon,&rdquo; essay; Soledad Reyes for &ldquo;Philippine Literature in Pilipino: Popular Not Elitist,&rdquo; essay;<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5197\">Isagani R.

Starting with grants awarded to writers in Filipino and English, the CCP has expanded the program to writers from the regions writing in various Philippine languages, as well as those writing in Filipino, the developing and evolving national language that is still largely based on Filipino or Tagalog. The main objective has been to promote the development of regional literatures in Cebuano, Ilocano, Ilonggo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2358\">Karay-a</a>, and in other languages, while not neglecting support and encouragement of writers in Filipino and English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The grants are in several categories: poetry, short story, full-length play, and novel. Unlike the literary competition, however, the grants program requires only that the applicants initially submit the equivalent of one-third of the projected output: one-third of a novel, two essays out of five, six poems out of eighteen, two stories out of five, or one act from a three-act play. The applications are accompanied by a concept paper explaining the background, rationale, substance, and significance of the envisioned collection or single work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Writers&rsquo; organizations have also benefited by way of venue grants, which enable them to hold workshops at the CCP&rsquo;s National Arts Center on Mount Makiling. Grants such as these pave the way for the formation of literary organizations in the regions, which in turn published the work of their members and allow them to serve as models for young writers, a situation that attests to the multiplier effect of the grants. Fellowships in writing workshops are another form of grants. They typically cover board and lodging, a modest stipend, and transportation costs. Applicants, who are often young writers, submit samples of their works and fellowships are awarded competitively, based on the works&rsquo; promise. The University of the Philippines, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a>, Ateneo de Manila University, De La Salle University, and Mindanao State University annually host workshops, often with funding from the NCCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The NCCA also encourages the establishments of local arts councils and subsidized conferences and workshops. Other workshops that give out fellowships include the UP Visayas Summer Writers&rsquo; Workshop in the 1990s, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5184\">Cornelio F. Faigao Writers Workshop</a> in Cebu, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5434\">Lamiraw Creative Writing Workshop</a> in Samar and Leyte, the San Agustin Regional Writers Workshop (later renamed Fray Luis de Leon Creative Writing Workshop) in Iloilo, the Panagsugat All Visayas Creative Writing Workshop, the Cordillera Creative Writing Workshop in Baguio City, the Arejola Workshop in Camarines Norte, and the Davao Writers Workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other institutions that give out writing grants in the regions include the Dungog Kiniray-a Foundation and the Peter Solis Neri Foundation for Hiligaynon Literature and Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For more senior writers, the UP Institute of Creative Writing, formerly the UP Creative Writing Center, awards national and regional fellowships who are chosen by a jury based on the quality and consistency of their works. They enjoy a one-year fellowship, which entails the honorific title of National or Regional Fellow and a monthly stipend. They are then required to make a public presentation of the work completed during their tenure. Fellowships are awarded in the following genres: poetry, essay, fiction, drama, and criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5234\">De La Salle University </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5234\">Bienvenido N. Santos Creative Writing Center</a> also grants one-year fellowships to Lasallian faculty and staff who are completing works of fiction, poetry, and criticism. The school&rsquo;s College of Liberal Arts also gives out mini-grants, the subject of which must be completed within a year from receipt of the grant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2011, the NBDB began giving out grants worth 200,000 pesos from the &ldquo;Filipino Authors&rsquo; Trust Fund,&rdquo; set up in accordance with Republic Act 9521, envisioned to &ldquo;promote the continuing development of book publishing industry in all regions.&rdquo; Every year, the board identifies &ldquo;topics&rdquo; in which there is a dearth of published titles, under which proposals must fall. At the time of the application, the manuscript must be complete. On its first year, one of the categories was the English translation of a novel originally written in at least 25 percent of a regional language or a novel in English by an author from outside Metro Manila. It was won by Zamboanga-based novelist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5275\">Antonio Enriquez</a> for the manuscript of his novel <strong>The Siege of Fort Pilar</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary awards, grants, and fellowships have been useful in boosting the writing careers of many Filipino writers. The lack of outlets, the poor income from creative writing, and the relatively low priority given to literature and cultural production in an economically underdeveloped country are some of the reasons given for sustaining literary competitions and grant programs. But the most important reason for Filipino writers seems to be the need for recognition and acceptance of their works by society&rsquo;s established writers, as well as by their own peers in the writing profession. This has been helpful to many writers. Still, a basic problem has persisted over the years: how to gain the acceptance and acclaim of the bigger <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/74/1561\">audience</a> (and jury) of readers among the people, who are after all the ultimate arbiters of the success or failure of the literary product. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Joi Barrios, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5736\"><strong>Rolando B.

In the Philippines, charges of patronage, cliquism, and parochialism remain common and persistent (Santiago 2012, 52-53). The impression that literary awards privilege friendships and personalities rather than merit became more pronounced and entrenched in the 1990s, as writers became inextricably tied to universities and institutions while becoming further isolated from the rest of society."

				"value": "Literary awards, grants, and fellowships have been useful in boosting the writing careers of many Filipino writers. The lack of outlets, the poor income from creative writing, and the relatively low priority given to literature and cultural production in an economically underdeveloped country are some of the reasons given for sustaining literary competitions and grant programs. But the most important reason for Filipino writers seems to be the need for recognition and acceptance of their works by society&#x2019;s established writers, as well as by their own peers in the writing profession. This has been helpful to many writers. Still, a basic problem has persisted over the years: how to gain the acceptance and acclaim of the bigger <a href=\"/9/74/1561\">audience</a> (and jury) of readers among the people, who are after all the ultimate arbiters of the success or failure of the literary product. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Joi Barrios, <strong><strong><a href=\"/9/80/5736\"><strong>Rolando B.

Scholarship refers to research in literary history and most often involves data collection and classification. Criticism refers to the use of scholarly work for the systematic and rigorous study of literary texts, which is often through the lens or multiples lenses of a critical or theoretical framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"spanish\" name=\"spanish\"></a>The Spanish Colonial Period: 1703-1898 </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Spanish Augustinian Fr Gaspar de San Agustin, in his <b><i>Compendio de la Lengua Tagala</i></b> (Summary of the Tagalog Language), 1703, relates that fellow missionary Fr Francisco de San Jose had shown some natives various poems written according to the rules of Spanish rhyming, to which one of them remarked: &ldquo;Magaling, datapoua hindi tola&rdquo; (It is good, but it is not poetry). This was the first published critical statement on literature known to have been made by a Filipino. The greater significance of this statement, however, is that it indicates that the indigenous Filipinos had their own criteria for defining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, distinct from those defining Spanish, or European, poetry. San Agustin&rsquo;s <b><i>Compendio</i></b> is actually a grammar book; the final chapter is a discussion and illustration of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> versification. Here, he covers its three aspects: rhyme, meter, and genre. He also divides Tagalog poetry into two types: the dramatic, like the <b>soliranin</b>, and the <b>dalit</b>, which is serious in theme. He further enumerates other types: <b>diona</b>, <b>oyayi</b>, and <b>auit</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other missionary poets, grammarians, and compilers of sample <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1552\">folk poems</a> also codified the conventions of native poetry. In the mid-18th century, the state of Tagalog poetry had two commentators. Fr Melchor de Oyanguren&rsquo;s <b><i>Tagalysmo Elucidado, y Reducido [en lo Posible] a la Latinidad de Nebrija</i></b> (Tagalism Elucidated, and Reduced [Where Possible] into the Latin of Nebrija), 1742, confirmed San Agustin&rsquo;s earlier description of Tagalog poetry. The second commentator was Francisco Bencuchillo, whose <b><i>Arte Poetico Tagalo</i></b> (Art of Tagalog Poetry), 1750, published in 1895, is a more extensive description of Tagalog versification. It follows San Agustin&rsquo;s classification of rhymes but observes more possibilities for Tagalog rhyme than San Agustin did. At the turn of the 19th century, Fr Joaquin Martinez de Zu&ntilde;iga described Tagalog poetry in <b><i>Estadismo de las Islas Filipinas</i></b> (State of the Philippine Islands), based on his personal observation during poetry declamations and dramatic presentations. He gave the number of lines for various types of stanzas, the rhyming scheme, and the number of syllables per line for types of poems. The poems were invariably lyrical, usually about love or &ldquo;some minor matters pertaining to their farms.&rdquo; Among the other cultural forms that he saw were native dances accompanied by singing. These provoked his remark that the Fathers had set certain &ldquo;limits of modesty,&rdquo; a statement that explains to a great extent the absence of erotic poetry in the anthologies of the period and the lack of published secular poetry until the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the last of the missionaries to make a commentary on Tagalog poetry was Fr Joaquin de Coria in the last section of his <b><i>Nueva Gramatica Tagalog</i></b> (New Tagalog Grammar), 1872. In seven chapters, he gives a general description of the types and functions of Tagalog poetry, as well as the manner in which each type is recited. The three most important chapters in this book are &ldquo;Reglas del Tayotay en Tagalog&rdquo; (Rules of Tagalog Metaphor), &ldquo;De la Poesia en Idioma Tagalog&rdquo; (Of Poetry in the Tagalog Language), and &ldquo;De los Metros del Verso Tagalog&rdquo; (Of Meters in Tagalog Verse). Coria focuses his attention on rhyme and meter, using these as basis for defining the <b>tanaga</b> (four-line stanza, with seven syllables per line) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><b>comedia</b></a> (which he also described to be imitations of <i>comicos latinos</i>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Apr 1887, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> delivered a paper in German titled &ldquo;Tagalische Verkunst,&rdquo; which he read before the Sociedad Etnografica in Berlin. He later translated this into Spanish, titled &ldquo;Arte Metrica del Tagalog&rdquo; (The Metrical Art of the Tagalog). This was the most thorough description of poetic conventions thus far written, noting details like the following: that a serious poem uses the dodecasyllabic line with a caesura on the sixth or seventh syllable; that a syllable may be added or removed as dictated by the meter; that, within one stanza, the monorhyming scheme may be adopted but another stanza must have a different rhyme; that a quatrain, generally composed of dodecasyllabic lines, is used for lyric poetry, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&rsquo;s poetry may serve as model; and, finally, that the <b>quintilla</b>, which generally consists of five hepta- or octosyllabic lines, is used for long narrative poetry that does not require rhetorical flourishes or imaginative elements, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a> is a typical example. Stressing that &ldquo;free verse is not recognized&rdquo; by the Tagalog, Rizal then lists 12 kinds of rhyme, which he asserts are what distinguish Tagalog rhyme from that in any foreign literature, especially Spanish. To this date, this list of rhyming patterns still applies to Tagalog rhymed poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 19th century, the rise of the bourgeois class also gave rise to the desire for conformity. In literary criticism, this desire was translated into concern for orthodoxy and style. <b><i>Manga Puna</i> </b>(Criticisms), written in the early 19th century and published in 1907, by Filipino priest <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5233\">Ani</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5233\">ceto de la Merced</a>, pointed out doctrinal errors and weaknesses of style in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><b><i>Pasiong Mahal</i></b></a>, 1814. Self-styled Spanish scholars, such as Sebastian de Totanes, Vicente Barrantes, and Toribio Minguella, wrote critical commentaries of Philippine literary forms. Barrantes&rsquo;s <b><i>El <strong>Teatro</strong> Tagalo</i></b> (Tagalog Theater), 1889, provoked vehement refutations from the propagandists in Madrid, foremost of whom was Jose Rizal, who published &ldquo;Excmo. Sr. D. Vicente Barrantes&rdquo; (His Excellency, Sir Vicente Barrantes), 1889, in <b><i>La Solidaridad</i></b>. Minguella, in &ldquo;Estilo Poetico&rdquo; (Poetic Style), 1878, criticized the <b>korido</b> for lack of truthfulness, declaring that its contents should be based on correct theological doctrine and on the lives of real historical personages or saints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Verisimilitude, or the concept of literature as a &ldquo;mirror of life,&rdquo; was used as a basis for the debate between Spanish scholars, who wrote critical commentaries of Philippine literary forms, and the propagandists in Madrid, foremost of whom were Jose Rizal and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>. Spanish critics who denounced Rizal&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b> (Touch Me Not), 1887, were Vicente Barrantes, who dismissed it as full of lies, and Spanish friar Jose Rodriguez, who, in his &ldquo;Caiingat Cayo!&rdquo; (Take Care!), called it heretical. Defenders of the novel were Marcelo H. del Pilar, whose satirical response &ldquo;Caiigat Cayo!&rdquo; (Hunt for the Eel), 1888, affirmed the truthfulness of the <b><i>Noli</i></b>. V. Caraig likewise refuted Rodriguez&rsquo;s claims in his essay &ldquo;M. R. P. Padre Jose Rodriguez,&rdquo; 1890. Ferdinand Blumentritt, an Austrian scholar, defended the novel by citing the oppressive conditions in the Philippines. Hence, literary criticism was based on the concept of literature as a &ldquo;mirror of life&rdquo; and a &ldquo;guide to life.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>The American Colonial Period: 1900-1940 </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The systematic diffusion of Anglo-American culture would shape a new sensibility that would have consequences on the critical works of the period. However, during the first decade of the 20th century, verisimilitude and didacticism continued to be the guiding principles of literary criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the earliest critics to appear on the scene during the first decade of the American colonial period were those who decided to study Tagalog literature, which had opened itself up to genres other than the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a> called <b>awit </b>and <b>korido</b>, religious poetry, and lives of saints. With a growing number of literate Filipinos looking for other reading fare, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a> emerged to answer the need for works that depicted familiar worlds. Poetry itself had to diversify and to take into account other topics and issues that were being discussed during this period of intense colonization. In the past, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> derived much influence from the awit and korido (in the case of the <i>komedya</i>) and from the pasyon (in the case of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><i>sinakulo</i></a>), both in a nonrealist mode. Now it had to contend with the new demand for a more realistic representation of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tagalog newspaper <b><i>Muling Pagsilang</i></b>, 1901-10, was an outlet for the critical essay. Many critiques were also delivered as lectures or speeches in conferences. Commenting on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K. Santos</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1699\"><strong>Banaag at Sikat</strong></a></i></b> (Glimmer and Light), 1906, Tagalog critics Macario Adriatico, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5306\">Gabriel Beato Francisco</a>, Manuel B. Francisco, and Godofredo Herrera debated on the timeliness of the Socialist program suggested by the novel. Similarly, the didactic element was the focus in Ubaldo Manapat&rsquo;s critique of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1690\"><strong>Anino</strong></a></i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1690\"><b><i> ng Kahapon</i></b></a> (Shadow of Yesteryears), 1907, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5434\">Francisco Laksamana</a>. In the longest critical essay written during that first decade, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5032\">Rosauro Almario</a> did a more systematic study of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5010\">Faustino </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5010\">Aguilar</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1715\"><strong>Busabos ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Slave of Fate), 1909. He evaluated the novel using the criteria of &ldquo;organic unity, interest, and verisimilitude.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a> cited the novel&rsquo;s achievement in unmasking society, whereas <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5480\">Gonzalo Cue Malay</a> focused on the characters as victims of society&rsquo;s ills. In general, the critical essay of this period was marked by the tendency to be polemical, rhetorical, and personal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second decade saw the critics paying more attention to the rhetorical elements of a literary work. An exchange of ideas between <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5660\">Carlos Ronquillo</a> and Rosauro Almario focused on the diction, metaphor, and imagery of Almario&rsquo;s own novel, <b><i>Nang si Eba ay Likhain</i></b><i> </i>(When Eve Was Created), 1913. Beginning in 1914, a question arose as to whether the &ldquo;epilogue&rdquo; attached to a novel was also literary criticism. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>, in &ldquo;Matapos Basahin&rdquo; (After Reading It), his epilogue to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3147\">Precioso Palma</a>&rsquo;s novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1752\"><strong>Ipaghiganti Mo Ako!</strong></a></i></b> (Avenge Me!), 1914, believed there was a distinction, whereas Carlos Ronquillo, in &ldquo;Ang mga Panghuling Salita&rdquo; (Afterword), his epilogue to <b><i>Nang si Eba Ay Likhain</i></b>, believed that the epilogue&rsquo;s function was to analyze and evaluate the work. Other epilogists/critics were Honorato de Lara, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5332\">Teodoro E. Gener</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5169\">Remigio Mat Castro</a>. This twofold role of the epilogue established the tendency in literary criticism at this time to heap lavish praise on the work or, at least, to overlook its flaws. For example, in his epilogue to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5013\">Rosalia Aguinaldo</a>&rsquo;s novel <b><i>Mutyang Itinapon</i></b><i> </i>(Exiled Sweetheart), 1922, Dionisio San Agustin notes the inconsistencies in characterization but concludes that the novel&rsquo;s value lies in the &ldquo;nobility of thought&rdquo; personified by the characters. During this period, therefore, and on to the 1940s, didacticism continued to be the overriding concern, and this resulted in criticism that was highly impressionistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">That said, while much work was done on Tagalog literature, there were also many calls to reject the past, in this case the literary types identified with the discredited Spanish regime and found wanting in their failure to approximate the real world of a subject people. A clear example was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/712\"><b><i>Ang <strong>Dulang Tagalog</strong></i></b></a> (The Tagalog Drama), 1938, a scathing attack on the popular komedya. The critic&rsquo;s argument focused on the komedya&rsquo;s predisposition toward a highly idealized, thus false, rendering of experience. This critical position would find its most extreme manifestation in the series of works written by both American and Filipino writers which reduced the rich variety of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1543\">Philippine literature in Spanish</a> and the local languages into a collective nonentity, and at the same time argued that the texts being written in English were the only significant productions of the first two decades of American rule. In addition, critics such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5788\">Leopoldo Yabes</a> would make the fearless forecast that the great Filipino work could be written only in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, a number of critics thought that there was a need to preserve what had been handed down from the past not only for the future generations to enjoy, but also for the world to know that the country had its own rich and varied literature. Colonialism was a powerful force that had led the natives to believe that they had not produced any significant body of literature. The first attempts at writing various &ldquo;literary histories&rdquo; would prove to the skeptical ones that indeed numerous writers had contributed to their country&rsquo;s literary heritage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lope K. Santos, in his <b><i>Peculiaridades de la Poesia Tagala</i> </b>(The Peculiarities of Tagalog Poetry), 1929, would continue the work on Tagalog poetics where Rizal left off. Already the concern for placing one&rsquo;s theoretical statements in historical context is signified by Santos&rsquo;s first chapter, which consists of a survey of the work done by the missionary critics like San Agustin, Bencuchillo, Martinez de Zu&ntilde;iga, and de Coria. The purpose of this survey is to demonstrate their failure to capture the essence of Tagalog poetry. Here, Santos declares that the missionary poets&rsquo; stress on religious versification and their own badly written verses, which they held up as models of good poetry, were largely responsible for the deterioration of Tagalog poetry, which, before Spanish intervention, was vigorous in both content and technique. He adds that the rhyming scheme of Tagalog poetry is also to be observed in that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a>, and other Philippine languages. This was a step toward giving a national scope to the study of Philippine poetry that Rizal had begun. At the end of his paper, Santos suggests the four periods into which the history of poetry may be divided: the pre-Hispanic, religious or mystical, revolutionary, and contemporary or philosophical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, Hermenegildo Cruz&rsquo;s <b><i>Kun Sino ang Kumatha nang &ldquo;<strong>Florante</strong>&rdquo;</i></b> (On Who Authored <strong><em>&quot;</em><i>Florante&quot;</i></strong>), 1906, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5238\">Epifanio de los Santos</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Balagtas y Su &ldquo;Florante&rdquo;</i></b> (Balagtas and His <em><strong>&quot;</strong></em><b><i>Florante&quot;</i></b>), 1916, broke new ground in the choice of issues and methodology. These two studies of Francisco Baltazar or Balagtas&rsquo;s classic poem <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Florante and Laura), 1838, served as models for a critical approach combining historical data, biographical materials, sociological insights, and reader response. What these works established at this point was the need to situate the text against its context&mdash;the society from which it emerged, the functions of the text, the manner in which the work is received, and the role of the writer in the production of meaning. In both critical works, the relevance of Balagtas&rsquo;s poem to the generations being educated under the American colonial regime was stressed, its value as a source of moral values and patriotic fervor emphasized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This didactic view of literature shaped the thinking of a large number of critics who would perceive in literature and literary analyses a powerful and effective means to teach the reader how to be a good citizen, a morally upright person, and a God-fearing individual. In this phase of criticism, when critics were dependent on established truisms aptly summarized in the classic formulation &ldquo;dulce et utile&rdquo; (sweet and useful) as the proper function of literature, the polemical and political thrust of the critical project was to defend native culture in the face of a massive assault against it. Variations on these aforementioned concepts on the nature and function of criticism appeared in various prefaces and introductions to a large number of Tagalog novels published in the first two decades and in poetry books written by the likes of Lope K. Santos and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5330\">Pedro Gatmaitan</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In the 1930s, the Institute of National Language sponsored a series of lectures on the different aspects of Tagalog literature. The result was perhaps the first systematic compilation of essays that dealt directly with specific literary genres, such as poetry, novel, drama, short story, and specific writers and works like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5374\">Valeriano Hernandez Pe&ntilde;a</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5218\">Modesto de Castro</a>, and the popular korido <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1880\">Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></a> </i></b>(Adarna Bird). Among these texts that provided a diachronic view of the genre were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5630\">I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Pagkaunlad ng Nobelang Tagalog</i></b> (The Development of the Tagalog Novel), 1939; Lope K. Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Tinging Pahapaw sa Kasaysayan ng Panitikang Tagalog</i></b> (A Cursory Look at the History of Tagalog Literature), 1938; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5313\">Fausto Galauran</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Maikling Kathang Tagalog</i></b> (The Tagalog Short Story), 1938. These attempts at constructing a history of the literary type were generally uneven in scope and depth. Nonetheless, they provided the impetus needed for the development of the critical perspective concerned primarily with establishing a framework against which the development of a particular genre could be viewed. Moreover, the critical essays have remained to this day invaluable sources of data, especially on the different stages in the development of the genre in the last decade of Spanish rule and the first decades of American rule. Two books in the series were on specific works: <b><i>Ang Lakan ng mga Makatang Pilipino na si Balagtas at ang Kanyang &ldquo;Florante&rdquo;</i></b> (The Prince of Philippine Poets Balagtas and His <b><i>Florante</i></b>), 1938, by Hermenegildo Cruz and <b><i>Si Valeriano Hernandez Pe&ntilde;a at ang Kanyang &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1779\"><strong>Nena at Neneng</strong></a>&rdquo;</i></b> (Valeriano Hernandez Pe&ntilde;a and His <b><i>Nena and Neneng</i></b>), 1940, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5076\">Nieves Baens del Rosario</a>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1920s and 1930s, a new group of writers started to take upon themselves what they perceived was a critical task: to shape the directions that literary productions ought to follow. The group, headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/4998\">Alejandro G. Abadilla</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5249\">Clodualdo del Mundo,</a> saw literature as being too beholden to the legacy of traditional writing best exemplified by the works of Balagtas. They looked at themselves as principal agents for creating a new generation of writers more attuned to developments in Western literature. The criteria of form and universalism began to be used to measure literary works, along with a deliberate avoidance of authorial comment, emotional restraint, and the preference for artistic unity. In their newspaper columns, Abadilla&rsquo;s Mga Talaang Bughaw (Blue Lists) and del Mundo&rsquo;s Ang Tao sa Parolang Ginto (The Person in the Golden Lighthouse), they evaluated the poems and short stories being written during this time and selected what they deemed to be the best of the lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1935, a group of university-educated writers with some knowledge of Western literary trends and familiarity with such writers as Katherine Anne Porter, Sherwood Anderson, and Theodore Dreiser formed Panitikan. Calling themselves both &ldquo;sakdalista&rdquo; (an allusion to the peasant group protesting social conditions of the period) and &ldquo;aristokrata&rdquo; (an unbiased posture of superiority), they proceeded to do a critique of traditional ways of writing led by del Mundo and Abadilla. In perspective, their attempt to chart the directions of Tagalog literature during the American period should be seen partly as a reaction to the perceived gains being made by Filipino writers in English during the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the more influential members of the group who would exert tremendous influence in the short story was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5007\">Teodoro Agoncillo</a>. He became the chronicler of the literary era that witnessed the first wave of modernism. The issues in the debate between the traditional and younger critics surfaced more clearly in the discussion of the prizewinning entries in the contest sponsored by <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></i></b> in 1943. The anthology<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/1981\"><i>Ang</i></a></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/1981\"><i> <b>25 Pinakamabuting Maikling Kathang Pilipino ng 1943</b></i></a> (The 25 Best Pilipino Short Stories of 1943), 1944, showcased works that had a consciousness of the modern short story from the West. Clearly, the young critics had by this time learned to valorize texts that utilized techniques learned from the West and to deprecate writing that seemed steeped in sentimentality and didacticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Agoncillo&rsquo;s critique in 1936 of Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Banaag at Sikat</i> </b>demonstrated the critical principle that ideology and idea must be expressed through literary elements and devices. Comparing the novel to the works of Rizal, he argues that Santos&rsquo;s creation is more propaganda than art, and that the characters are driven by the plot and by ideas rather than by realistic depiction. Writing on the same novel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5443\">Juan C. Laya</a> declared that its value lay in its content, although its long-winded speeches weakened its artistic merit. Another example of the dichotomy between subjectivism and formalism in literary criticism is Nieves Baens del Rosario&rsquo;s critique of Valeriano Hernandez Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Kasaysayan ng Magkaibigang si Nena at si Neneng</i></b> (The Story of the Friends Nena and Neneng), 1940. She praises the novel for three reasons: its didactic element, emotional restraint, and realism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, literary criticism in the 1920s was being published in the newsmagazine <b><i>Sanghiran nin Bikol</i></b> and in the <b><i>Bikolana</i></b> magazine by writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3121\">Mariano Nicomedes</a> and Mariano del Prado Goyena. Nicomedes&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hayokong na Pinagpagalan Dapit sa Paagi nin Pagsarambit sa Bikol&rdquo; (A Short Essay on How to Write Poetry in Bicol) offers a definition of poetry in Bikol, which he calls the <b>sinarambit</b>. Goyena&rsquo;s &ldquo;Siisay si Rizal?&rdquo; (Who is Rizal?) is a review of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5569\">Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>El Caracter de Rizal</i></b> (The Character of Rizal), 1918. The first few issues of the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a></i></b> magazine (then called <b><i>Ang <strong>Bisaya</strong> sa Hiligaynon</i></b>), 1934, showed the essayists&rsquo; keen interest in literary theory and its application to their own literature. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5260\">Lorenzo Dilag Fajardo</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Aton Manunulat kag Ila Sinulatan&rdquo; (Our Writers and Their Writing), 1934, used samples of Ilonggo writing to define story-writing technique, to distinguish between the long and the short story, and to do an influence study of established Ilonggo writers and their followers. This triggered a response from Lerio Pama, who wrote &ldquo;Langkoy Sabat kay Dilag Fajardo&rdquo; (In Reply to Dilag Fajardo) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5361\">Delfin Gumban</a>, who wrote &ldquo;Kon sa Akon Lamang&rdquo; (In My Opinion). In turn, Dilag Fajardo tried to extricate himself from this debate by protesting in yet another essay, &ldquo;Paathag kay G. Lerio kag kay G. Delfin Gumban&rdquo; (Explanation to Mr Lerio Pama and Mr Delfin Gumban): &ldquo;My critique was not whimsical but, as usual, based on what is right, guided by things which serve as my criteria to strengthen my critique. I did not condemn or praise the writing of Mr Delfin Gumban&rdquo; (Hosillos 1992, 213).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary criticism in Spanish was represented by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5349\">Fernando Ma. Guerrero</a>, Pardo de Tavera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5051\">Cecilio Apostol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5242\">Jaime de Veyra</a>, and Epifanio de los Santos, who uniformly affirmed their pride in Philippine literature. Epifanio de los Santos&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nuestra literatura a traves de los siglos&rdquo; (Our Literature through the Ages), 1914, is one of the first surveys of Tagalog literature. It shows the development of Tagalog poetry from the early native songs, to Spanish forms like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><b>duplo</b></a>, <b>awit</b>, <b>korido</b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><b>loa</b></a>, <b>pasyon</b>, and dramatic verses of the <b>komedya</b>, to Francisco Baltazar&rsquo;s lyrics and the poetry of the propaganda movement. Fernando Ma. Guerrero&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Formacion de una Poesia Tipicamente Filipina&rdquo; (The Formation of a Typical Filipino Poetry), 1924, argues that Philippine literature cannot be written in any foreign language, but must be written only in the native languages. In the same vein, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5133\">Manuel Briones</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Discursos y Ensayos</i></b> (Speeches and Essays), 1954, contains the speech &ldquo;La Afirmacion de lo Filipino en la Literatura&rdquo; (The Affirmation of the Filipino in Literature), which states: &ldquo;What matters is not the form and dress, or medium of expression, of this idea or feeling, but the Philippine reality, the block carved from the native quarries; in a word, the indigenous and national context.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the American educational system produced students who were increasingly steeped not only in the English language but in American and British literary criticism, criticism in English began to be written. The crucial decision to make English the medium of instruction in the whole country meant the introduction of a whole new curriculum that certainly encompassed more than what the few educated natives had gone through during the Spanish period, as well as the wider dissemination of a foreign language not possible earlier. A centerpiece in this curriculum was English as a subject with both the grammar and the literature components. Among the more famous teachers during this period were Dean S. Fansler and his wife Harriet Ely Fansler, George Pope Shannon, Tom Inglis Moore, Harold P. Scott, and C. V. Wickers. They taught not only the rudiments of English grammar but also and more importantly the works of English and American writers. What was inculcated therefore was not merely the use of English to communicate with one another and to understand the lessons being taught in that language, but a whole way of looking at a world that was not at all familiar to the students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In literature classes, Romantic and Victorian writers were taught. Their works were eventually taken as models for writing. The result was impressive: students wrote and their works saw print in a number of magazines in English, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5589\"><b><i>Philippine Education Magazine</i></b></a> and <b><i>Graphic</i></b>. The new culture was further strengthened with the founding of such groups as the Philippine Writers&rsquo; Association, 1925; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5752\">UP Writers&rsquo; Club</a>, 1927; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5590\">Philippine Writers League</a>, 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Preoccupied in the first three decades with mastering a foreign tongue, the writers had little time for criticism, though a few works still managed to surface. In 1910, the first issue of the University of the Philippines&rsquo; <b><i>College Folio</i></b> contained a study of the metrical romance by Wilfrido de Leon, the <b>comedia </b>in Zambales by Alejandro Dumlao, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/445\"><b>carrillo</b></a> by Frank X. Memije. In a later issue in the same year, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5415\">Maximo Kalaw</a> described &ldquo;real Philippine literature&rdquo; as the blending of the native, Spanish, and Saxon elements. His study of the awit in a 1912 essay analyzes its place in the national literary tradition and the quality of its rhetorical devices. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5494\">Fernando Maramag</a>, who dominated the field of criticism from 1910 to 1930, stressed the need for standardizing the criteria for criticism, in an essay &ldquo;A Call for Critics,&rdquo; 1912, which has criticism itself as its subject matter. His subsequent essays&mdash;&ldquo;The Poetry of Rizal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Juli&mdash;A Review,&rdquo; &ldquo;Juan F. Salazar,&rdquo; &ldquo;Balagtas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guerrero&mdash;Poet and Patriot&rdquo;&mdash;are demonstrations of critical practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The movement for independence stimulated an interest in the expression of Filipino culture and identity in art and literature. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5123\">Jorge Bocobo</a> wrote &ldquo;Cultural Independence of the Philippines,&rdquo; 1925, in which he predicts that great Filipino literature will be written in a Philippine language, although in his time, he knows that &ldquo;this sounds like heresy.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5148\">Casiano T. Calalang</a>, in &ldquo;On Story Settings,&rdquo; 1927, urges fictionists to turn to the countryside for their setting, instead of focusing on city life. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5209\">Amador T. Daguio</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Malayan Spell and the Creation of a Literature,&rdquo; 1934, criticizes the writers&rsquo; penchant for using American models and suggests a return to native tradition for inspiration. Pedro de la Llana, in his collection <b><i>A Book of Comment and Criticism</i></b>, 1926, includes two essays on the subjects of &ldquo;sane criticism,&rdquo; and iconoclasm in criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">English works in the first decades were imitative of popular texts in theme and technique. But what was incontrovertible was the enthusiasm of young writers for the new language perceived as their bridge to the world. They were guided by the likes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5369\">A. V. H. Hartendorp</a> and other American critics whose knowledge of criticism was based on what they had learned at the turn of the century. But even early on, such qualities as sentimentalism, didacticism, excessive lyricism, and stereotyped characters were viewed as detracting from the quality of any work. Thus, the foundation was laid for criticism that eschewed precisely those qualities which characterized much of literature in the local languages. Works that explored new dimensions in literary expression were consequently privileged over those that did not. More than anything else, the skillful use of technique assured discovery and renown. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5486\">Federico Mangahas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5457\">Alfredo Elfren Litiatco</a>, and their contemporaries articulated the principles of fine writing or belles lettres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5464\">Salvador P. Lopez</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5788\">Leopoldo Y. Yabes</a> were two outstanding literary scholars of that generation. In his book <b><i>Literature and Society</i></b>, 1940, Lopez advanced a literary theory of social consciousness that has become a dominant school of thought in Philippine letters. On the other hand, Yabes pioneered in the study of Philippine ethnic and regional literature, first with his article on <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a></i></b>, 1934, and then with <b><i>A Brief Survey of Iloco Literature</i></b>, 1935. These two works show how the presence of a seductive foreign language and literature did not completely overwhelm the native consciousness of social reality. Wielding the newly acquired articulateness in English, some Filipino writers took issue with the direction that fine writing was taking their English-besotted colleagues. The result of this literary critique was a body of social commentaries in which the craft of writing is prized, not for its intrinsic value of self-expression, but for its power to interpret and change the world. It was during this period that a kind of polarization took place in criticism. The first tendency was represented by Jose Garcia Villa, and simplistically perceived as hewing closely to the doctrine of <i>ars gratia artis</i> (art for art&rsquo;s sake), where the aesthetic qualities held preeminence. The second tendency was manifested in Lopez, who was influenced by the sociological approach shaped by Marxism, then asserting itself as a critical school of thought and a political movement in the United States. The polar positions asked what the nature of the literature is and what its role in Philippine society is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The debate between the two began when Villa first set into writing his aesthetics in &ldquo;Explanation,&rdquo; which accompanied his &ldquo;Poems for an Unhumble One,&rdquo; 1933, in the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></i></b>. Lopez criticized Villa&rsquo;s excessive indulgence in linguistic idiosyncracies in &ldquo;On Villa&rsquo;s Poetical Credo,&rdquo; 1933, in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></i></b>. In his subsequent essay, &ldquo;The Poetry of Jose Garcia Villa,&rdquo; while admitting that Villa&rsquo;s poetry had the &ldquo;sincere and passionate expression which is at the heart of all poetry,&rdquo; Lopez still maintained that it was characteristically &ldquo;effete and bloodless.&rdquo; Federico Mangahas in &ldquo;What Good Are Writers?,&rdquo; 1939, challenged writers to dwell on &ldquo;economic inequality and oppression,&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5061\">Manuel Arguilla</a> unwittingly agreed with Mangahas&rsquo;s call when he retorted that the writers needed no prodding, for they were already writing with a social consciousness. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5664\">Arturo B. Rotor</a> elaborated on Lopez&rsquo;s theory of literature, revealing his proletarian sympathies in &ldquo;Writers without Readers,&rdquo; 1939, and &ldquo;Our Literary Heritage,&rdquo; 1940. As a result, a spirited debate took place which led the board of judges for the Commonwealth Literary Contests to declare that a writer was worthy of recognition only if his work used as reference &ldquo;the social matrix in which our humanity exists.&rdquo; Two leading critics who refused to subscribe to &ldquo;proletarian literature&rdquo; were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a> and A. E. Litiatco. Arcellana&rsquo;s column, Art and Life, in <b><i>Herald Midweek Magazine</i></b>, consisted of personal thoughts on literature and criticism; for example: &ldquo;Orientation is a function of discovery in the sense of Consciousness, Awareness, Identification&mdash;a tremendous Consciousness, a terrible Awareness, and final Identification.&rdquo; Litiatco in &ldquo;Dictatorship in Literature&rdquo; debunked Rotor&rsquo;s call for writers to focus on the working class by claiming that to do so would be to write from secondhand experience, since none of the writers he knew belonged to that class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In perspective, criticism as it manifested itself in the first half of the 20th century in both English and in the local languages employed a number of presuppositions culled from existing critical perspectives. For the critics in the local languages, literature was always a text or a theme with which the ordinary reader could identify: thus, the mimetic theory appeared to be the central source of insights. The text&rsquo;s linkages with history, the writer, and the audience were never in doubt, even as the critics displayed a deep historical sense. This tendency was to be challenged by the young critics who were members of Panitikan in the 1930s. Criticism in English, on the other hand, shaped by the Romantic theory of art as creation, stressed the autonomy of literary texts and emphasized the relationship between the author and the piece of work. This notion, rooted in the expressive theory of art, found its most powerful defender in Jose Garcia Villa. But this position was roundly criticized by the group headed by Salvador Lopez as irrelevant, especially in the context of specific historical experiences&mdash;in particular, the two colonial periods, which had followed each other only a generation earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"postwar\" name=\"postwar\"></a>The Postwar Period: 1946 to the 1980s </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The World War II period quieted the critics in English somewhat, except for certain sporadic attempts like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5388\">F. B. Icasiano</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fence-Sitters and Intellectuals,&rdquo; 1943, which tried to adapt to Japan&rsquo;s program of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere by suggesting a return to &ldquo;the old ways of the Orient.&rdquo; However, criticism in Tagalog was encouraged; and it was in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> magazine, 1944, that I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado and Alejandro G. Abadilla argued about the definition of Tagalog poetry. Regalado insisted that it had to have rhyme and meter; Abadilla retorted that a poet had the right to choose to write in free verse. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5687\">Ildefonso Santos</a>, taking a conciliatory position, suggested that it was not the presence or absence of rhyme and meter alone that defined poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Criticism of literature picked up again after World War II. The revival issue of the UP journal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5456\"><b><i>Literary Apprentice</i></b></a>, 1948-49, carried articles by American critics David Daiches and Edith Sitwell besides a set of critiques by Arcellana, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5779\">Manuel Viray</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3414\">Lydia V. Arguilla</a>, and Angel R. Hidalgo, all focusing on the poetry of Jose Garcia Villa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One area in which much effort was expended was related to the need for textbooks in Philippine literature classes. These textbooks in general carried with them the historical-sociological orientation of traditional criticism, having been written as surveys of Philippine literature. Teofilo del Castillo&rsquo;s <b><i>A Brief History of Philippine Literature</i></b>, 1937, was one of the earliest literary histories. Some other notable works were <b><i>Panitikan ng Pilipinas</i></b> (Literature of the Philippines), 1954, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5565\">Jose Villa Panganiban</a> and Consuelo T. Panganiban and <b><i>Philippine Literature from the Past to the Present</i></b>, 1966, by Teofilo del Castillo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5506\">Buenaventura Medina Jr</a>. Other anthologies in English were Arthur Roseburg&rsquo;s <b><i>Pathways to Philippine Literature</i></b>, 1966, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5216\">Asuncion David Maramba</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Contemporary Philippine Literature</i></b>, 1965. In Filipino, Juan Laya published his series <b><i>Diwang Kayumanggi</i></b> (Spirit of the Brown Race), while Alejandro G. Abadilla came out with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1923\"><b><i>Parnasong Tagalog</i></b></a> (Tagalog Parnassus), 1950. Other notable literary historians during the 1950s and 1960s were Teodoro Agoncillo, who published his history and anthology <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2032\">Ang Maikling Kuwentong Tagalog, 1886-1948</a> (The Tagalog Short Story, 1886-1948), 1949, and Clodualdo del Mundo, with his collection of critical essays <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1629\"><b><i>Mula sa Parolang Ginto</i></b></a>, 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Simultaneous with the publication of these historical surveys and anthologies of Philippine literature were attempts by the younger critics to continue what they had begun before World War II. Agoncillo founded and edited the short-lived <b><i>Malaya</i></b>, which became the venue for the more artistically crafted works after the war years. Del Mundo&rsquo;s magazine <b><i>Daigdig</i></b> likewise died after a few issues. Abadilla realized that commercial magazines could not subsist on artistic texts. In 1938, he founded his own literary magazine, <b><i>Panitikan</i></b>, to which both established and aspiring young writers and critics contributed. <b><i>Panitikan </i></b>was the first serious venue for critics to express their ideas. This magazine published the works of such young critics as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5033\">Virgilio S. Almario</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5672\">Epifanio San Juan Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5646\">Pedro Ricarte</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5002\">Efren Abueg</a>, who would subsequently make a name for themselves in various literary genres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from these literary histories and anthologies, other critical texts appeared in the 1960s, which significantly altered the landscape of Philippine criticism, especially in English, which by this time had strengthened its position as the intelligentsia&rsquo;s language of discourse. Courses in Philippine literature in English were initiated in a number of colleges and universities, making this subject a regular part of the curriculum. With this institutionalization, there were demands not only for anthologies and surveys but critical texts that would explain the primary texts. Foremost among these critical texts were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5252\">Ricaredo Demetillo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1573\"><strong>The Authentic Voice of Poetry</strong></a></i></b>, 1962; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5165\">Leonard Casper</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Wayward Horizon: Essays on Modern Philippine Literature</i></b>, 1961; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1680\"><strong>The Wounded Diamond: Studies in Modern Philippine Literature</strong></a></i></b>, 1964; the anthology <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1586\"><b><i>Brown Heritage</i></b></a>, 1967, edited by Antonio G. Manuud; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5385\">Lucilla Hosillos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1646\"><b><i>Philippine-American Literary Relations</i></b></a>, 1969; and the anthologies <b><i>Philippine Fiction</i></b>, 1972, and <b><i>The Philippine Novel in English</i></b>,<i> </i>1979, both edited by Joseph A. Galdon, SJ. With the exception of <b><i>Brown Heritage</i></b>, all the above-mentioned works dealt with the various genres in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The dominant literary school in the 1950s was American New Criticism, which entered the country mainly through Filipino scholars sponsored by American foundations. Generally, the texts followed a basic formalist orientation even as the analysis focused principally on the text and its formal characteristics. The approach was both descriptive and evaluative, a tendency which was most clearly exhibited in most of the essays included in the various anthologies. Writers who studied in the writing centers of Kenyon and Iowa were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5727\">Edilberto</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5728\">Edith L. Tiempo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5344\">N. V. M. Gonzalez</a>, Bienvenido Santos, and Ricaredo Demetillo. Edilberto Tiempo&rsquo;s &ldquo;Form in Filipino Fiction,&rdquo; 1953, was one of the earliest demonstrations of the New Critical method. However, the method drew some complaints for the tendency of some of its practitioners toward rigidity, dogmatism, and esoterics. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5168\">Jose Luna Castro</a> spoke for others when he remarked in the <b><i>Literary Apprentice</i></b>, 1955, &ldquo;It is difficult to read, it defies lay understanding; it is written, one suspects, for fellow critics and the handful of intellectuals on the campuses.&rdquo; In a more caustic vein, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5746\">Juan C. Tuvera</a> dismissed the recent trends in critical writing as the cultivation of &ldquo;double-talk to stampede the innocence and the very essence of life out of the present literary scene &hellip; One must now, like a cold-blooded hound, pursue the spoor of the Symbol and, among the under brush of language, track down that villainous Meaning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Demetillo noted that the history of literary criticism could be seen as a dichotomy between Lopez&rsquo;s and Villa&rsquo;s schools of thought. As a New Critic, he concluded by affirming Villa&rsquo;s aesthetics. Continuing the dialectic begun in the Commonwealth period, Yabes offered an alternative to New Criticism by advocating a sociological and historical approach, thus locating the literary work within the moment and the milieu. Meanwhile, classical criticism with a moralistic bent was encouraged by the Ateneo journal <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>, begun in 1953, and led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5118\">Miguel Bernad</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5118\">, SJ</a>. Another exception to the formalist thrust was Hosillos&rsquo;s work, which used a comparative and historical approach. But in general, books published in the 1970s showed a formalist orientation as seen, for example, in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5023\">Ophelia Dimalanta</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Poetics</i></b>, 1976; and in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/4997\">Gemino Abad</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1614\"><strong>In Another Light: Poems and Essays</strong></a></i></b>, 1976, and <b><i>A Formal Approach to Lyric Poetry</i></b>, 1978, which were some of the more significant critical works of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The privileged position of Philippine literature in English as the only type of literature worth formal studies was eventually challenged in the 1960s and 1970s with the appearance of critical texts analyzing literature in the local languages. Written in English, a number of key articles by Bienvenido Lumbera, Clodualdo del Mundo, and others in <b><i>Brown Heritage</i></b> were devoted to the study of the short story, poetry, and literary criticism in Tagalog. Written in the 1960s, the chapters of Bienvenido Lumbera&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1670\"><b><i>Tagalog Poetry, 1570-1898: Tradition and Influences in Its Development</i></b></a>, 1986, look into the corpus and characteristics of Tagalog poetry throughout the Spanish colonial period. Lumbera&rsquo;s approach is primarily formalist, though informed by a sociohistorical contextualization that develops in his later, more political work like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1654\"><b><i>Revaluation</i></b></a>, 1984, a collection of essays where he most fully articulated a nationalist literary tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino was used in a number of influential <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\">essays</a>. Through this gesture, Filipino gained stature as a language for the academe and ceased being associated only with popular literature. This tendency to employ the native tongue, a political move against the ascendancy of English, was reinforced with the publication of a series of essays in university journals and newspapers published by Manuel L. Quezon University, the University of Santo Tomas (UST), and the University of the East.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These were the institutions that nurtured the likes of Virgilio S. Almario, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5487\">Rogelio Mangahas</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5046\">Lamberto Antonio</a>, who defined the meaning of modernism in the contemporary Philippine context, and became its major influential practitioners. Distinctly formalist in orientation, these young critics viewed traditional writing and criticism associated with the older critics as sorely in need of openness to Western literary influences. Well-read in the criticism of the formalist school and exposed to the modern techniques of such writers as Pablo Neruda, John Steinbeck, W. H. Auden, the French Symbolists, among many others, this group proceeded to do a critique of the existing modes of literary analysis. They found fault with the moralistic, historical approaches of the older critics and criticized the dependence of I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado and company on literary theories already supplanted by the more vigorous and powerful formalist doctrines. The major work of criticism written in Filipino in the early 1970s was Virgilio S. Almario&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Makata sa Panahon ng Makin</i>a</b> (The Poet in the Machine Age), 1971, which was a compilation of his essays published in the 1960s. In this work, Almario challenged some of the entrenched beliefs of traditional criticism by exposing what he considered the excesses and flaws of traditional poetry, which he described with characteristic acerbity as &ldquo;preserved information.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, therefore, formalism in its various manifestations seemed to be a promising enterprise in criticism whether written in English or in the local languages. Although the historical sense was not totally lost, as exemplified by the texts of Lumbera and Hosillos, the dominant theory which won over many adherents was what is termed as the organic theory, or the emphasis on the autonomy of the text perceived as generally abstracted from history. But also at that point, a certain rigor had begun to characterize literary criticism, particularly in the close reading or analysis of text. Although largely untheorized, a large number of critical works during this period seemed to have benefited from the critics&rsquo; deepening realization of the nature and function of criticism as a separate discipline. By using formalist canons with understanding, the critic&rsquo;s task became clearer: the exegesis of the text with a view to providing an intelligent interpretation of its meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Other critical schools of thought began to emerge in the 1960s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5509\">Patricia Melendrez-Cruz</a> used the Jungian archetypal approach. A wide range of critical perspectives are exemplified in the Urian Lecture Series, 1969-71, of the Ateneo de Manila University&rsquo;s Department of Philippine Studies, with critical studies by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5372\">Amado V. Hernandez</a>, Efren R. Abueg, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5211\">Petronilo Bn. Daroy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3965\">Felipe Padilla de Leon</a>, Teodoro A. Agoncillo, Rogelio G. Mangahas, Virgilio S. Almario, Rogelio R. Sikat aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5698\">Rogelio Sicat</a>, Pedro L. Ricarte, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5262\">Anacleto I. Dizon</a>, Pablo R. Glorioso, Nenita Escasa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5272\">Genoveva Edroza-Matute</a>, Buenaventura S. Medina Jr, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5194\">Andres Cristobal Cruz</a>. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The ascendance of formalism in literary criticism would not go unchallenged as the nation found itself increasingly and more deeply politicized in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Lopez&rsquo;s earlier pronouncements on the relationship between literature and society were solidified by Marxist-Maoist criticism. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5700\">Jose Ma. Sison</a> applied its principles to Filipino literature in his &ldquo;Message to PAKSA on the Task of Cadres in the Cultural Field,&rdquo; 1971. Using this theoretical framework, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a> enumerated the specific concerns of the critic in &ldquo;Ang Paghuli ng Adarna&rdquo; (Catching the Adarna), 1976, and, on an earlier occasion in 1971, continued the tradition of critical debate in an exchange with poet-critics Epifanio San Juan Jr and, later, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4510\">Ricardo Lee</a>&rsquo;s critique of three novels, &ldquo;Ang Lipunan bilang Isang Bilangguang Putik: Pahapyaw na Sulyap sa Tatlong Nobelang Pilipino&rdquo; (Society as a Mud Prison: A Cursory Look at Three Novels in Pilipino), 1971, belongs to the social-realist tradition and expresses the need for a correct ideological framework with which to analyze social conditions. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1970s, <b><i>Sagisag</i></b> magazine was the publishing outlet for the critical and literary essays of Bienvenido Lumbera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5734\">Delfin Tolentino Jr</a>, Nicanor Tiongson, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5640\">Jun Cruz Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5505\">Buenaventura Medina</a>, Virgilio S. Almario, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5324\">Fanny Garcia</a>. Essays by Kris Monta&ntilde;ez (pseud.) on the literature of the political underground movement and written between 1974 and 1987 have been compiled in <b><i>The New Mass Art and Literature, 1974-1987</i></b>, 1988. Other critics guided by classical Marxism during this period were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5320\">Edel Garcellano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\">Alice Guillermo</a>, Domingo de Guzman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5724\">Luis V. Teodoro Jr</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5743\">Rosario Torres-Yu</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of crucial texts at this period were published by Epifanio San Juan Jr: <b><i>Balagtas: Art and Revolution</i></b>, 1969,<i> </i>and<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1652\"><strong>The Radical Tradition in Philippine Literature</strong></a></b></i>, 1971. In his studies of such major writers as Balagtas, Jose Rizal, Lope K. Santos, and Amado V. Hernandez, San Juan turned his back on formalism in favor of a dialectical-historical approach. With these works, the debate was no longer exclusively between traditional and formalist modes of analysis, but between formalism and Marxism. San Juan continued to publish critical works which were critiques not only of the formalist position but were, in the 1980s, elaborations and applications of Marxist theory as it had been shaped by some categories from poststructuralism, Lacanian psychoanalysis, and other contemporary European theories. His subsequent works include <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5138\">Carlos Bulosan</a>&nbsp;and the Imagination of the Class Struggle</i></b>, 1972; <b><i>Toward a People&rsquo;s Literature</i></b>, 1984; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1667\"><b><i>Subversions of Desire</i></b></a>, 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The historical approach favored by Marxists also influenced the studies made by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5385\">Lucila Hosillos</a>, whose <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1634\"><strong>Originality as Vengeance in Philippine Literature</strong></a></i></b>, 1984, was one of the more self-consciously theoretical works in this period. The same approach could be seen in Almario&rsquo;s landmark study of Tagalog poetry in the 20th century, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1577\"><strong>Balagtasismo versus Modernismo</strong></a></i></b>, 1984. Almario also published <b><i>Taludtod at Talinghaga</i></b> (Verse and Metaphor), 1985, a study of poetic form and structure; and <b><i>Jose Corazon de Jesus: Mga Piling Tula </i></b>(Jose Corazon de Jesus: Selected Poems), 1984, his analysis of the contribution of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a> to the art of Tagalog poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was also during the 1970s that Filipino scholars and literary historians focused their attention on the different literatures from the regions written in the local languages and specific literary genres. This was heavily influenced by the birth of the interdisciplinary Pilipinolohiya or Philippine Studies doctoral program in the University of the Philippines Diliman in the 1970s. Like its counterparts in psychology (Sikolohiyang Pilipino) and linguistics and historiography (Pantayong Pananaw), Philippine Studies sought to further the decolonization process in search of what was &ldquo;authentically&rdquo; Filipino. To do so, the graduate program sought to integrate the study of art and the study of the social sciences so as to have more critical and comprehensive views on Philippine culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the works on regional literary traditions were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5490\">Edna Zapanta Manlapaz</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Kapampangan Literature: A <strong>Historical</strong> Survey and Anthology</i></b>, 1981; Rosalina Chan-Castro&rsquo;s <b><i>Literature of the Pampangos</i></b>, 1981; and Gregorio C. Luangco&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1979\"><strong>Waray Literature: An Anthology of Leyte-Samar Writings</strong></a></i></b>, 1982. Studies in fiction included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\">Soledad</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> S. Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1632\"><b><i>Ang Nobelang Tagalog</i>, <i>1905-1975: Tradisyon at Modernismo</i></b></a><i> </i>(The Tagalog Novel, 1905-1975: Tradition and Modernism), 1982, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5517\">Resil B. Mojares</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Origins and Rise of the Filipino Novel</i></b>, 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were studies that sought to give an overall perspective of Philippine literature broken down into its components. This meant the inclusion of oral literature, which for a long time had been marginalized by a culture, literature, and discourse rooted in a literate society. The more significant works were Roger Bresnahan&rsquo;s <b><i>Literature and Society: Cross-Cultural Perspectives</i></b>, 1977; Joseph Galdon&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1659\"><strong>Salimbibig: Philippine Vernacular Literature</strong></a></i></b>, 1980; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5284\">Damiana Eugenio</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Philippine Folk Literature</i></b>, 1982, and her series on its various genres: myths, legends, folktales, proverbs, riddles, and songs. There were also <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5253\">Francisco Demetrio</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Myths and Symbols</i></b>, 1978; and the ASEAN anthology <b><i><strong>Epic</strong>s of the Philippines</i></b>, 1983. All these made available the richness of Philippine ethnic literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Still, what was not fully explored and developed was the analysis of oral traditions using the combined categories of criticism and cultural anthropology, although deep insights are proferred in such works as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\">E. Arsenio Manuel</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1973\"><strong>Tuwaang</strong></a></i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1973\"><b><i> Attends a Wedding</i></b></a>, 1978; F.

In general, English was still the language used by a large number of critics. But in several major critical works, Filipino was used to discuss the problematics chosen by the writers. Clearly, this was a political move on the part of some of the critics who understood the need to use the native language to constitute their critical discourse on their own linguistic terms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bienvenido Lumbera and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5467\">Cynthia Lumbera</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1644\"><b><i>Philippine Literature: A History and an Anthology</i></b></a>, 1982, departs from previously published textbooks in Philippine literature in the country by making &ldquo;periodization of Philippine literary history follow a political framework.&rdquo; The narrative of class conflict is central to the Lumberas&rsquo; framework, built on a dichotomy between the <i>tagabayan</i> (from the town) and the <i>tagabukid/tagabundok</i> (from the countryside / the uplands) created during the Spanish colonial period. This dichotomy has assumed different forms over history, as the reformists versus the revolutionaries in the 19th century and the proponents of &ldquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; versus the advocates of &ldquo;socially conscious literature&rdquo; in the 20th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1980s, there was an increased interest in literary criticism and literary theory as separate critical projects. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5197\">Isagani Cruz</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1580\"><b><i>Beyond Futility</i></b></a>, 1984, was probably the first attempt of its kind to assess the achievements of some of the country&rsquo;s major critics. It was in the 1980s, however, that the Filipino critic realized the need to go beyond what formalism and orthodox Marxist analysis could offer. The intellectual ferment that was brewing in Europe and the United States in literary theory started to shape the terms of engagement in the Philippines in the mid-1980s. It was a time for learning what semiotics, structuralism, poststructuralism, modernism, and postmodernism, feminism, reception theory, and other conceptual systems were all about. This uncertainty was reflected in the articles written during this period where the Filipino writers still found themselves grappling with the complex ideas of Anglo-American and European scholars as Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, Terry Eagleton, Julia Kristeva, Helene Cixous, Fredric Jameson, Pierre Macherey, Raymond Williams, Michel Foucault, Paul de Man, and other Western leading lights of new theory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"edsa\" name=\"edsa\"></a>Since EDSA (1986 Onward)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fall of the Marcos dictatorship led to a resurgence in publishing on all fronts. At the same time, with the opening up of the public sphere, the academe, the primary locus of critical and scholarly production in the country, found itself reorienting in new ways to society, the state, and to global market forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Marxist tradition in Philippine criticism was most affected by these changing developments. Ironically, the collapse of the dictatorship and the growth of the public sphere simultaneously opened up more avenues for the publication of critical studies, while simultaneously de-emphasizing the need for such (social) criticism at all. This would further be compounded by what was seen by many as the global &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; of the Left. Internationally, this was rooted in the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Locally, this was seen in the re-criminalization of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) under the Aquino administration, and the subsequent internal purges and eventual spilt of the CPP itself in the latter half of the 1980s and during the early 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This period also witnessed the increasing liberalization of the Philippine economy, especially during a string of deregularization and privatization policies under Pres Fidel V. Ramos. This push to make the Philippine economy compatible with policies of the international community&mdash;as advocated by bodies like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization&mdash;was itself reflected in the steady integration of the Philippine academe into global academic economies, primarily, though far from only, in the Western world and in East and Southeast Asia. The resulting integration led to greater exposure to new critical theories in the mid-1980s and 1990s, like feminism, poststructuralism, and postcolonialism, which led to an explosion of critical and scholarly production in the Philippines. It also led to greater influences from new methodologies like cultural studies, which have broadened the horizon of acceptable objects of study from literary texts to the living text of the entire culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, increased participation in both local and international conferences has facilitated closer and more heated conversations between Filipinos and academics abroad. Owing in part to the increasing supply of available grants and scholarships, more and more Filipinos academics have been able to study in universities abroad and have often afterward chosen to settle there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Important campus-based journals include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5450\"><b><i>Likhaan</i></b></a>, <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5261\"><b><i>Diliman Review</i></b></a>,<b> </b>UP Diliman; <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i></b> and <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>, Ateneo de Manila University; <b><i>Dagmay</i></b>, UP Mindanao; <b><i>Mindanao Journal</i></b>, Mindanao State University; <b><i>Tambara</i></b>, Ateneo de Davao University; and <b><i>Kinaadman</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>Xavier University. These provide space for criticism. However, the standardization of international policies within the academe, such as in the strengthening of &ldquo;publish or perish,&rdquo; has changed the way in which critical and scholarly work is being published in journals and university and commercial presses. Internationalization has led to a greater call for journals and publications that meet &ldquo;international standards.&rdquo; This manifests most explicitly in the attempt of Philippine journals to gain certification from the Institute for Scientific Information, as well as the high demand among academicians to be published in said journals. While this ostensibly allows for greater recognition and interaction with international communities, the uncritical adoption of these academic trends has a number of problematic effects, including the privileging of English language texts, and the risk of subsuming Philippine intellectual production into the markets of Anglo-American academic publishing (Guillermo 2013, 508).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another development affecting the production of criticism in the Philippines is the rise of the World Wide Web. The Internet has made the circulation of knowledge cheaper, faster, and wider and has become an avenue for international cooperation and coordination among scholars. Many journals are uploaded online, and some like <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i> </b>are available exclusively online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Significant as they are, of course, the international cooperation of diasporic critics is but a symptom of a greater phenomenon. In spite of the push for internationalization, as well as the continued deprioritizing of the humanities, one of the effects of these various trends has been the strengthening of a sense of a community of Filipino critics working within a tradition of Philippine criticism and scholarship. In recent years, this affect has been institutionalized in the creation of criticism workshops, such as the UST<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\">J. Elizalde Navarro</a> Workshop in Criticism, the IYAS criticism workshop, and the Kritika Kultura Criticism Workshop. Like the creative writing workshops on which they are based, the aim of these criticism workshops is networking and mentoring. The workshops attempt to consolidate a Philippine critical community along both vertical (intergenerational) and horizontal (intra-generational) axes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There has never been more diversity in Philippine criticism and scholarship. This is best seen perhaps in the various attempts at construing a &ldquo;national&rdquo; canon, as well as the numerous reactions to it. The most common conflict in this debate concerns the categorization of &ldquo;national&rdquo; and &ldquo;regional.&rdquo; The realization in the 1970s of the need to focus on regions apart from Manila has led to the slow but increasing support for regional literatures. This has led in turn to problematizing the place of regional traditions vis-&agrave;-vis the &ldquo;national.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Harnessing Regional Literature for National Literature,&rdquo; Bienvenido Lumbera defines national literature as a body of work that invokes and projects the imagined community of the Filipino nation. He points out, however, that the traditional classification of national literature has been filtered through both class as well as language, with &ldquo;regional&rdquo; literature being comprised of the tradition written in the local languages, and &ldquo;national&rdquo; literature being written in Spanish, English, and Tagalog. Both filters were a product of an elite and colonial educational system, with the mistaken belief that what they had construed as &ldquo;national&rdquo; was superior to everything else. In the end, however, Lumbera maintains the categories of &ldquo;regional&rdquo; and &ldquo;national,&rdquo; by which he means works that are focused on narrower local settings versus works that grapple with bigger perspectives of nationhood. He charges that more works from the regions need to be translated into Filipino so as to be able to find which of them belong to &ldquo;national&rdquo; literature, so as to have a more representative example of the concept of the Philippine nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This division has received criticism from various fronts. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5034\">Merlie Alunan</a>, who addresses Lumbera&rsquo;s criteria directly in &ldquo;Latitudes of Intimacy: New Waray Writing and National Literature,&rdquo; argues that all literature necessarily works with both particulars and universals, the latter being found precisely in the exploration of the former. Thus, a truly encompassing national literature does not exclude the local (or the &ldquo;vernacular&rdquo;) but is precisely the conglomeration of all these parts. Other reactions to both Lumbera&rsquo;s concept of &ldquo;national&rdquo; and the idea of national literature are expressed in <b><i>Many Voices: Towards a National Literature</i></b>, 1995, which contains the views of Edelberto Garcellano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5326\">J. Neil Garcia</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5255\">Leoncio Deriada</a>, Victor Sugbo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5650\">Aida Rivera-Ford</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5337\">Christine Godinez-Ortega</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5130\">Jose A. Bragado</a>, who collectively represent various interests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">An analogous collection is <b><i>Nationalist Literature: A Centennial Forum</i></b>, 1995, which collected essays in a conference for the 1896 Centennial. As noted by editor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5542\">Elmer Ordo&ntilde;ez</a>, the nationalist tradition is marked by the continuance of the spirit of 1896, the end goal of which is &ldquo;the realization of a truly sovereign and just society for the broad mass of the Filipino people&rdquo; (ix). The book contains essays by important critics associated with the Philippine Left and the national democratic struggle, such as Salvador P. Lopez, Bienvenido Lumbera, Petronilo Daroy, and Alice Guillermo, among many others. Meanwhile, the content ranges from readings and rereadings of literary texts to literary theorizing to surveys of literary production. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Much of the debate on national literature has influenced and has been influenced by the surge of scholarship on literary and cultural materials from across the Philippines. In contrast (or perhaps in tandem) with the forces of globalization, the turn of the millennium has seen a resurgence in interest for the local literary traditions, both for writers and critics alike. Continuing the developments in Philippine studies in the 1970s, scholars are still recording, examining, and disseminating much of the cultural material across the archipelago. A large number of the books produced by scholars are surveys and/or anthologies of the said materials with historical contexts that tackle the development of, say, a local literary form. On the other hand, other critical works are dissections of Philippines cultural texts through a combination of empirical data and various strategies culled from different critical traditions and methodologies, especially Marxism, cultural (and historical) materialism, feminism, postcolonialism, and cultural studies. Generally, these strategies and theories are not imposed on the data but are instead used as flexible frameworks for a primarily inductive analysis. In doing so, the reconfiguration of these frameworks yields a greater understanding of both Philippine culture and the theories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An example of that tendency is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Bayan sa Labas ng Maynila / The Nation beyond Manila</i></b>, 2007, which collects 12 essays critiquing cultural material from around the country. In &ldquo;Judas and His Phallus: The Carnivalesque Narratives of Holy Week,&rdquo; for example, Lucero looks into the various national, sexual, and folk discourses that circulate in a Judas-Iscariot-centered fiesta in Antique. Other essays include an analysis of the images of the 1896 Revolution in Ilonggo literature in the first half of the American era, and study on the concepts of time and space in the narrative chants of the Dulangan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> using a mix of historical, economic, sociopolitical, and textual analyses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like Lucero, Isidoro Cruz combines multiple critical strategies in his readings of Visayan literature and popular culture in his book <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1651\"><b><i>Pungsod: Damming the Nation; Region/Nation and the Global Order in Contemporary West Visayan Literature</i></b></a>,<b> </b>2009. His earlier <b><i>Cultural Fictions: Narratives on Philippine Popular Culture, Politics, and Literature</i></b>, 2004, collects essays that are also &ldquo;critical narratives&rdquo; or &ldquo;fictions,&rdquo; within which Cruz sets a semiotician&rsquo;s scalpel upon various layers of Philippine culture. Apart from traditional literary products, Cruz also analyzes the kinds of social and ideological reproduction found in everyday cultural texts like English language drills and street signs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scholarship in Western Visayan literature includes <b><i>Siday: Mga Tulang Bayan ng Panay at Negros </i></b>(Siday: Folk Poetry of Panay and Negros), 1997, an anthology edited by Corazon Villareal of poetic forms from Hiligaynon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2358\">Karay-a</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a>, with notes on the formal features of every genre and translations of sample texts, including an excerpt from the epic <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5459\">Ma.

In &ldquo;Locating the Voice in Waray Poetry,&rdquo; Merlie Alunan critiques the homogeneity of the persona&rsquo;s voice behind the radio-performed <b>siday</b>, a homogeneity rooted in the collective assumption of a public poetic persona. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1921\"><strong>Panulaan at Dulaang Leytenhon-Samarnon</strong></a> </i></b>(Leyte-Samar Poetry and Drama), 1994, edited by Jaime Biron Polo, collects and translates almost 80 years of Waray poetry and drama. Biron historicizes the development of Waray poetry vis-&agrave;-vis the clash between tradition and asymetric modernization brought about by centuries of colonialism, which led to a split between poems that were &ldquo;taga-huron&rdquo; (from the countryside) and &ldquo;taga-sawang&rdquo; (from the city). Jose Duke Bagulaya uses a Marxist / historical materialist framework in <b><i>Writing Literary History: Mode of Economic Production and Twentieth Century Waray Poetry</i></b>, 2006, which traces the development of different strains of Waray poetry to the economic conditions that held sway in Samar and Leyte over the past century. The second half of Bagulaya&rsquo;s book is a bilingual anthology of samples of each of the genres he examines, thus also providing a much-needed anthology of Waray poetry to non-Waray speakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Bikol literature, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5626\">Maria Lilia F. Realubit</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1581\"><strong>Bikols of the Philippines</strong></a></i></b>, 1983, gives a history of Bikol literature from the Ibalon epic to the Golden Age of Bikol literary production in the early 20th century. Meanwhile, Jose Jason Chancoco&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1639\"><strong>Pagsasatubuanan: Poetikang Bikolnon</strong></a></i> </b>(Pagsasatubuanan:<b><i> </i></b>Bikol Poetics), 2008, studies the formal elements of traditional Bikol poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Studies in Ilocano literature are undertaken by Roderick Galam. Among other topics, his <b><i>The Promise of the Nation: Gender, History, and Nationalism in Contemporary Ilokano Literature</i></b>, 2008, takes up the Ilocano writers&rsquo; representation of martial law. Galam shows how the loyalist position of Ilocano writers has been challenged by younger writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5617\">Clesencio Rambaud</a>, whose work simultaneously supports benevolent militarization while critiquing the Marcos regime&rsquo;s ineffectiveness at achieving that goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An interesting dual study of language and literature is Emmanuel Luis Romanillos&rsquo;s <b><i>Chabacano Studies, Essays on <strong>Cavite</strong>&rsquo;s Chabacano Language and Literature</i></b>, 2006. Romanillos presents the formal characteristics of Chabacano before discussing various Chabacano folk songs, riddles, and poems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Cebuano literature, the two-volume anthology <b><i>Cebuano Poetry / <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1953\"><strong>Sugboanong Balak</strong></a></i></b>, 1988, has been supplemented by the two-volume collection <b><i>Cebuano Fiction / <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2069\">Sugilanong Sugbuanon</a></i></b>. The bilingual collections begin with introductions by Resil Mojares, who traces the development of Cebuano poetry and fiction from the folk tradition and early literary production in the Spanish era to the golden age of Cebuano literature under the American occupation and its subsequent decline and marginalization after World War II and the imposition of Tagalog. Mojares notes the strong influence of journalism in early 20th-century Cebuano literature and of the effect of cinema on the short story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of studies have been done on early Tagalog literature and literary forms. In <b><i>May Gawa na Kaming Natapus Dini: Si Rizal at ang Wikang Tagalog</i></b> (We&rsquo;ve Finished Some Activity Here: Rizal and the Tagalog Language), 2002, Nilo Ocampo collects and comments on Rizal&rsquo;s different writings on the Tagalog language, including his letters to Blumentritt, his translation of Schiller&rsquo;s <b><i>Guillermo Tell</i></b>, and his unfinished novel <b><i>Makamisa</i></b>. Studies on literary forms include Galileo Zafra&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Balagtasan</strong>: Kasaysayan at Antholohiya</i></b> (Balagtasan: History and Anthology), 1999, which looks at the historical development of the once-popular literary form, positing that the &nbsp;both preserved native cultural traditions and served as a challenge and critique of colonial powers. In <b><i>Ang Dagling Tagalog: 1903-1936</i> </b>(The Tagalog Dagli: 1903-1936), 2007, editors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5736\">Rolando B. Tolentino</a> and Aristotle Atienza collect nearly a hundred <b>dagli </b>(vignettes), which are then classified into five categories. The introduction discusses the dagli as the product of conditions during the American colonial period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The postmodern breakdown of high and low culture has led to more intense scholarship and criticism in once-ignored and derided popular literature. This shift is perceptible in Soledad S. Reyes&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1637\">Pagbasa ng Panitikan at Kulturang Popular: Piling Sanaysay, 1976-1996</a> </i></b>(Reading Literature and Popular Culture: Selected Essays, 1976-1996), 1997.

Meanwhile, Rosario Cruz-Lucero&rsquo;s &ldquo;Voices from the Mountains: Folk Literature as Print and Performance Art,&rdquo; included in <b><i>Ang Bayan sa Labas ng Maynila / The Nation beyond Manila</i></b>, reviews the literature on oral literature, which she notes has moved from presenting folk texts as written literature (for they have to be written to be disseminated) to emphasizing (and so preserving) the performative aspects of oral tradition. Another essay is Raniela Barbaza&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Bayan bilang Kapwa: Katwiran at Batas sa Hinilawod&rdquo; (Nation as Fellow: Reason and Law in Hinilawod), 2013, published in the journal <b><i>Malay</i></b>, which uses the Bikol concept of man as rooted in his use of language to argue that the <b><i>Hinilawod</i></b> presents a concept of bayan that is created and recreated by and through speaking subjects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There is a growing interest in explicating marginal voices for social and historical purposes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5335\">Teresita Maceda</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Mga Tinig mula sa Ibaba</i></b> (Voices from Below), 1996, gathers and analyzes the songs of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas, Partido Socialista ng Pilipinas, Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon, and Hukbong Mapagpalaya sa Bayan, from 1930 up to 1955.

Much of Resil Mojares&rsquo;s work exemplifies this activity. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1677\"><b><i>Waiting for <strong>Mariang Makiling</strong></i></b></a>, 2002,<b><i> </i></b>problematizes the relationship between literature and historiography. It maintains that neither field is separate from the other and that both are discourses, and that no text, literary or otherwise, is separate from the material and symbolic networks within which it was conceived. At the same time, Mojares also asserts the heterogeneity of the Filipino nation, arguing that there is no one singular and essentialist definition of the Filipino. Both of these ideas are exemplified in the title essay, which proposes a cognitive mapping of the Filipino nation via a systematic analysis of the various subject-positions&mdash;and thence the social, historico-material, and ideological underpinnings&mdash;of each of the many retellings of the legend of Mariang Makiling. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1617\"><b><i>Isabelo&rsquo;s Archive</i></b></a>, 2013, presents commentary on various cultural texts throughout Philippine history, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1584\"><b><i>Brains of the Nation: <strong>Pedro Paterno</strong>, T. H. Pardo de Tavera, Isabelo de los Reyes and the Production of Modern Knowledge</i></b></a>, 2006, explores the individual lives and work of each of the three titular personages before it delves into a Foucauldian genealogy of the intelligentsia in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As already mentioned, Marxism experienced a steep drop in public/academic interest during the first decade after EDSA. Although the Left was bolstered at first by the victory against Marcos, the many aforementioned crises of the Left led to growing disenchantment for both revolutionaries and academics alike. Nevertheless, many critics continued to produce critically engaging work. In 1990, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5357\">Gelacio Guillermo</a> published<i> <b>Ang Panitikan ng Pambansang Demokrasya</b></i> (The Literature of National Democracy),<i> </i>which outlines the characteristics and overall project of the national democratic literature and reviews literary works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bienvenido Lumbera&rsquo;s political framework for emplotting the history of Philippine literature as well as his ideas on national literature are crystallized in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1683\"><b><i>Writing the Nation / Pag-akda ng Bansa</i></b></a>, 2005, a collection of his essays on literature, language, film, and other aspects of Philippine culture. Among the literature essays are &ldquo;Bakit Hindi Paksaing Pilipino&rdquo; (Why Not a Philippine Topic), a short essay where Lumbera speaks about his &ldquo;re-education&rdquo; from 1959 onward toward a more nationalist and Filipino-centered thinking; &ldquo;The Soil in Which We Root: Sources of Tradition for Contemporary Filipino Artists,&rdquo; where he problematizes the various forces that influence artistic production in the Philippines and in so doing, gives four main traditions that have been particularly influential&mdash;namely, ethnic culture, Philippine history, Christianity, and international/Western culture; and the aforementioned &ldquo;Harnessing Regional Literature for National Literature.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the crisis in the Philippine Left in the 1990s, Marxist criticism continued to grow in scope and complexity, in part to address the concerns brought out by other newer theoretical traditions. An example is the writings of Epifanio San Juan Jr, who reacts vehemently against postcolonialism in <b><i>After Postcolonialism</i></b>, 2000,<i> </i>and <b><i>In the Wake of Terror</i></b>, 2007. San Juan reemphasizes the need for a nationalist and historical-materialist perspective in lieu of what he finds as the postmodern and postcolonial obsession with deconstruction and identity politics. According to San Juan, the latter is especially troubling because it reduces the Marxian notion of class to just another category of the personality alongside gender and ethnicity, whereas the status of all three, he asserts, is enmeshed in a dialectic with modes of production. Like San Juan, R. Kwan Laurel also attacks postmodern liberties with truth and history in contemporary literature in English and the co-optation of critical discourse and the academe to market forces in <b><i>Philippine Cultural Disasters</i></b>, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Edel Garcellano continues to be an equally polemical writer. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1620\"><b><i>Knife&rsquo;s Edge</i></b></a>,<b> </b>2001, collects some of his most significant critical essays, mainly from three previous collections: <b><i>First Person Plural</i></b>,<b> </b>1987; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1615\"><strong>Intertext</strong></a></i></b>,<b> </b>1990; and<b> <i>Interventions</i></b>,<b> </b>1998. Garcellano proffers a polemical and theoretically nuanced Marxist critique, often utilizing poststructuralist, feminist, and reader-response theories as well. In &ldquo;Philippine Hermeneutics and the Kingpins of the Hill,&rdquo; Garcellano critiques the &ldquo;depoliticization of mainstream literary discourse&rdquo; by poets like Gemino Abad, who he thinks has an overly abstract and metaphysical understanding of language as a medium under the author&rsquo;s control, which thus can be neatly indigenized and owned. He also critiques the ideological, and often literal, collaboration of leading Philippines poets in the 1980s with the dictatorial state. Meanwhile, in &ldquo;The Arrogance of Imaginary Power,&rdquo; Garcellano dissects what for him is the continued nativist and anti-intellectual posturing of Virgilio S. Almario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the younger generation of critics, the more prolific ones are Rolando B. Tolentino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5358\">Ramon Guillermo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5370\">Caroline Hau</a>, and Neferti Tadiar. In <b><i>Sipat Kultura: Tungo sa Mapagpalayang Pagbabasa, Pag-aaral at Pagtuturo ng Panitikan</i></b> (Cultural Sight: Toward Liberative Reading, Study, and Teaching of Literature), 2007, Tolentino proposes reading literary and cultural texts along axes of history, society, and modernity&mdash;a socially oriented, theoretically savvy historical materialism that takes into account the ruptures and structures of modernization. In one essay, he contrasts the journey of Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epic </a>heroes and the journeys of contemporary overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), thus deconstructing the government&rsquo;s use of the label &ldquo;bagong bayani&rdquo; (new hero) for OFWs and revealing the exploitative and dehumanizing character of the state-sponsored enterprise. This reading practice reaffirms the transformative potential of literature, one that may be recruited for the creation of a truly just and nationalist society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ramon Guillermo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1649\"><b><i>Pook at Paninindigan</i></b></a> (Site and Stand), 2009, demonstrates that the &ldquo;translation&rdquo; and &ldquo;adaptation&rdquo; of Western ideas and theories can be useful and even socially transformative. Guillermo is also known for using computer-aided methods in his analyses of the linguistic characteristics of single texts as well as in the analyses of semantic patterns of words over large bodies of work. <b><i>Translation and Revolution</i></b>,<i> </i>2010,<i> </i>explicates the ideological forces in 19th-century Philippine nationalism by looking into the process by which Rizal translated Schiller&rsquo;s <b><i>Wilhelm Tell</i></b>. Guillermo has also used computer-aided methods to call out important Filipino historians. For example, &ldquo;Translation as Argument: The Non-Translation of <i>Loob</i> in Ileto&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1641\"><em><strong>Pasyon</strong></em><b><i> and Revolution</i></b></a>,&rdquo; 2014, published in <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b><i> </i>argues that Rafael Ileto&rsquo;s non-translation of <i>loob</i> gives the word mystical connotations, meanings which underpin the argument of Ileto&rsquo;s book. The actual use of the word in Tagalog texts throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, however, suggests that such interpretations of loob are overstated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The work of Caroline Hau focuses on the relationships between literature and nationalism, and the various roles of each in the production of the other. Hau is particularly interested in identifying &ldquo;the heterogenous elements &hellip; that inform, but also exceed, nationalist attempts to grasp, intellectually and politically, the complex realities at work in Philippine society&rdquo; (6). In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1631\"><b><i>Necessary Fictions</i></b></a>, 2000, Hau makes it clear that these excesses are irreducible by-products of the nationalist project, so the response to their identification should not be a poststructuralist abandonment of the nation, but rather a collective effort toward more sophisticated analyses of the nation. In her analysis of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1267\"><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></a></i></b> and Ileto&rsquo;s <b><i>Pasyon and Revolution</i></b>, she<b> </b>shows how both authors oppose rigid dichotomies of &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; and &ldquo;native&rdquo; in their constructions of syncretic and dynamic conceptions of key players in Philippine history&mdash;a Hispanicized bourgeoisie on the one hand and a mass-based folk Christian millenarianism on the other. But while &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; elements are the excesses of nativist narratives of Philippine history, Joaquin&rsquo;s and Ileto&rsquo;s constructions of Philippine history are haunted by other excesses&mdash;the masses in the former, the quotidian excess of certain millenarian rituals in the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>On the Subject of the Nation</i></b>, 2006, Hau continues her analysis of national mythmaking, focusing this time mostly on the lived experiences of collective belonging in marginalized testimonies (e.g., a personal account of the purges of the CPP, the story of an undocumented worker in Japan). These evince the problematic relationship of individuals to the nation, thus challenging and reconfiguring the very possibility of concretizing the nation as a political project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Neferti Tadiar examines the interpellation of marginalized peoples within both the material and the imaginary productive forces of globalization. In <b><i>Fantasy Production: Sexual Economies and Other Philippine Consequences for the New World Order</i></b>, 2004, she combines Marxism and psychoanalysis &agrave; la Zizek to analyze the ways in which the Philippine state attempts to structure the fantasies&mdash;that is, &ldquo;the hegemonic forms of expression of our desiring actions&rdquo; (6)&mdash;of its constituents. Tadiar points out that imagining and dreaming, such as the neocolonial Philippine dream of a First World fantasy, are integral to capitalist and colonial logic as forms of living labor. She analyzes an array of cultural phenomena to explore the dreaming of gendered, racialized, and sexualized subjects within the fantasies of the state, as well as dream acts that fall outside of it and that may serve liberative purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, <b><i>Things Fall Away: Philippine Historical Experience and the Makings of Globalization</i></b>, 2009, looks into the various material and cultural practices of Filipino marginalized/subaltern populations that &ldquo;fall away&rdquo; from the purview of both global and national narratives of development, and yet are part of the productive forces in the global capitalism. Thus, by looking into the activities and literature of feminized labor, urban activists, and revolutionaries, Tadiar uncovers how they often depart from the overarching narratives of globalization and of feminists, activists, and revolutionaries themselves, how they produce the conditions for the system that marginalizes them, and how they offer possibilities for newer/different forms of resistance. Tadiar shows in Fanny Garcia&rsquo;s story &ldquo;Pina, Pina, Saan Ka Pupunta?&rdquo; (Pina, Pina, Where Are You Going?) that the locus of decision making (in the context of prostituting feminized Filipina labor vis-&agrave;-vis American capital) lies not in an allegorical narrative of sacrifice but rather in the <i>kapwa</i> (shared subjectivity) system of &ldquo;syncretic sociability&rdquo; with other women in the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The recognition of the camaraderie in communities of women (with their own productive&mdash;though often unacknowledged&mdash;power and labor in society) is an important activity for many feminist movements, which seek to provide alternative (vis-&agrave;-vis the patriarchy) understandings of historical and social forces. When feminist literary criticism entered the country in the 1980s, this then became one of the goals in a number of feminist rereadings of canonical literary texts. A definition of a Filipino feminist theory appears in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5470\">Elynia Mabanglo</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Babae sa Loob ng Bote&rdquo; (The Woman inside the Bottle), 1990, published in the journal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5044\"><b><i>Ani</i></b></a>, to which Virgilio S. Almario replied with his essay &ldquo;Dula ng Balangkas at Sagisag: Panukalang Sipat sa &lsquo;Katipan&rsquo; ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5119\">Mike L. Bigornia</a>&rdquo; (Drama of Form and Symbol: A Proposed Study of Mike L. Bigornia&rsquo;s &ldquo;Katipan&rdquo;), 1990, eventually included in <b><i>Mutyang Dilim: Ang Bagong Pormalismong Filipino sa Pagbasa ng Tula </i></b>(Dark Muse: New Filipino Formalism in Reading Poetry), 2001. Another pioneering text is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5425\">Thelma Kintanar</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1679\"><strong>Women Reading: Feminist Perspectives on Philippine Literary Texts</strong></a></i></b>, 1992, which rereads important literary works in light of feminist critiques of patriarchal societies and the othering of women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Influenced perhaps by the feminist emphases on female comradeship and the deconstruction of masculine/public and feminine/domestic spaces, many critics collect the personal narratives of and/or encounters with and between women writers. These narratives allow their voices to be heard while also serving as primary material for the deconstruction of patriarchal and/or male-centric narratives in Philippine literary and cultural histories.

It analyzes Philippine gay culture from the 1960s to the 1990s and the writings of three early gay writers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3113\">Orlando Nadres</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a>.

In &ldquo;The Other Other: Towards a Postcolonial Poetics,&rdquo; 1989, Isagani Cruz argues that Philippine criticism suffers from a hegemonic internalization of the superiority of Eurocentric criticism over Philippine criticism, thus leading to the under-theorization of Philippine literature and culture. Cruz argues that it is necessary for Filipino critics to read the output of their own <i>kritikos</i>/<i>as</i> (critics) over the past century in order to build more a grounded theoretical practice in the Philippines. This essay has since been translated into Filipino and included in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1587\"><strong>Bukod na Bukod: </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1647\"><strong>Mga Piling Sanaysay</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Totally Incomparable: Selected Essays), 2003. That book and <b><i>The Other Other</i></b>, 2010, both edited by David Jonathan Y. Bayot, sum up Cruz&rsquo;s basic concerns, including the slippery concept of literature and the political engagement of the critic. Some of Cruz&rsquo;s essays are readings in structuralist and poststructuralist veins, for which activity Edel Garcellano took him to task in &ldquo;Post-EDSA Literature and Marxist Discourse,&rdquo; 1990.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as the 1980s, Cruz&rsquo;s call for a more postcolonial Philippine criticism was already being fulfilled. There were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1654\"><b><i>Revaluation</i></b></a>, 1984, and <b><i>Abot Tanaw: Sulyap at Suri sa Nagbabagong Kultura at Lipunan</i></b> (As Far as the Eyes Can See: A Glimpse and Analysis of a Changing Culture and Society), 1987, both by Bienvenido Lumbera; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1634\"><b><i>Originality as Vengeance</i></b></a>, 1984, by Lucila Hosillos; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1577\"><b><i>Balagtasismo versus Modernismo</i></b></a>, 1984, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1621\"><b><i>Kung Sino ang Kumatha Kina Bagongbanta, Ossorio, Herrera, Aquino de Belen, Balagtas, Atbp.: Mga Imbestigasyon sa Panitikan ng Kolonyalismo</i></b></a> (On Who Authored Bagongbanta, Ossorio, Herrera, Aquino de Belen, Balagtas, and Others: Investigations into the Literature of Colonialism), 1992, by Virgilio S.

Many of the essays revolve around either the need for further studies of marginalized literatures (e.g., Lily Rose Tope&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Chinese Margin in Philippine Literature&rdquo;) and proposals for new frameworks of studying literature (e.g., Angelito Santos&rsquo;s &ldquo;Philippine Oral Literature: An Introduction&rdquo;). In 2008, Legasto edited another much larger anthology, <b><i>Philippine Studies: Have We Gone Beyond St. Louis</i></b>. In her introduction, Legasto defines Philippine studies as an approach that aims to liberate Filipinos from the material and ideological structures of colonialism and neocolonialism, structures that have interpellated Filipinos as merely &ldquo;others&rdquo; in a Western hegemonic system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">J. Neil Garcia is another prolific postcolonial critic. In <b><i>Postcolonialism and Filipino Poetics</i></b>, 2004, Garcia critiques formalist-romantic poetics in Tagalog and in English writings as forwarded by Virgilio S. Almario and Gemino Abad. His main contention is that both critics propagate nativist aesthetics. While in certain ways recalling Garcellano, Garcia posits Philippine identity as being inherently hybrid and performative in nature&mdash;a process of becoming vis-&agrave;-vis the world&mdash;rather than being an essential, unchangeable being. Garcia argues that future rereadings of Philippine texts, in light of contemporary theories, should offer a more accurate depiction of plurality of Philippine identity and literary activity. Almario responds to Garcia&rsquo;s criticism in his introduction to his <b><i>Pag-unawa sa Pagtula: Pagususuri at Kasaysayan ng Panulaang Filipino</i></b> (Understanding Poetry: A Study and History of Filipino Poetry), 2006, to which Garcia then responds in his essay &ldquo;Nativism and Critical Theory,&rdquo; published in the first volume of his collection <b><i>The Postcolonial Perverse</i></b>, 2014.<i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">That all Philippine literature is inherently hybrid is a point that Garcia makes in a number of his essays, especially with regard to Philippine literature in English. In one of his most recent works, &ldquo;Translation and the Problem of Realism in Philippine Literature in English,&rdquo; 2014, published in the journal <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i></b>, Garcia argues that much of Philippine literature in English cannot be viewed from the lens of realism because the mimetic rhetoric of Western realism hinges on the use of the local language for verisimilitude. Philippine literature in English is thus always, both literally and conceptually, a product of translation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino writers based abroad have contributed much in theorizing identity, especially the relations between &ldquo;native&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign.&rdquo; Vicente Rafael&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1592\"><b><i>Contracting Colonialism</i></b></a>, 1988, looks into the multifaceted relationship between conversion and translation in the Philippines and the contradictory uses of the latter in the hands of Spanish missionaries and Tagalog natives. According to Rafael, the Spaniards saw translation (including the formalization of Tagalog grammar) as a way to subsume the Tagalog language into a semantic hierarchy that privileged Latin and Castilian as means of access to God. Translation thus served the Spanish purposes of domination and control. However, the Tagalog translated the Spaniards with a different purpose: the accumulation of words and signs into their own preexisting paradigms. Thus, for example, while the Spanish attempted to contract the meanings of words like <i>utang na loob</i> (debt of gratitude) and <i>hiya</i> (shame) in light of the man&rsquo;s dependent relationship with God, the Tagalog understood this relationship (and so their relationships with <i>Dios</i>, Hesus, Maria, etc.) in light of their own notions of reciprocal debt-relationships. Rafael then argues that this kind of evasive translation was oftentimes a conscious and intentional act of resistance by the Tagalog, an act that allowed them to simultaneously function within two contrasting worlds and benefit from both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the dozens of works on issues such as transnationalism and the diaspora itself, there are E. San Juan&rsquo;s <b><i>Racial Formations / Critical Transformations</i></b>, 1992, a critique of multiculturalism and ethnic studies, and Augusto Fauni Espiritu&rsquo;s <b><i>Five Faces of Exile: The Nation and Filipino American Intellectuals</i></b>, 2007, which reads the works of five Filipino American writers (Villa, Bulosan, Santos, Gonzales, and the diplomat <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\">Carlos P. Romulo</a>) to provide a transnational account of Filipino-ness that explores the social formation of national identity in a position of exile. Tying together diasporic and LGBTQ criticism is Martin Ponce&rsquo;s <b><i>Beyond the Nation: Diasporic Filipino Literature and Queer Reading</i></b>, 2012, which reads Filipino literature written in the United States through a matrix of neocolonialism, migration, and gender and sexuality in the subject formation of Filipino identities and nationalism in the United States. On the topic of diasporic critics themselves, on the other hand, there is Caroline Hau&rsquo;s &ldquo;Privileging Roots and Routes: Filipino Intellectuals and the Contest over Epistemic Power and Authority,&rdquo; 2014, published in the journal <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>, which looks into the contradictions imbued in increasing skepticism of Filipino intellectuals in the archipelago about the capacity of Filipino intellectuals based abroad (especially Filipino Americans) to speak for and about the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This debate, and the potential for hostilities and productive insights that come with it, will certainly continue in the years to come, as the Philippine state, the Philippine academe, and the Filipinos as laborers, teachers, critics, and scholars continue to integrate into the global economic system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most contemporary Filipino critics participate in a discursive field that combines various strategies and theoretical dispositions with the end goal of explicating Philippine cultures. Quite often, the critic will not identify with any one or two of the traditional schools of criticism, choosing to either declare himself or herself a student of multiple fields, or else to reject classifications altogether as unimportant and/or detrimental to understanding the complexities of Philippine reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, a number of Philippine critics do identify and/or consistently engage with specific schools (or multiple schools) of criticism. For many of these critics, the active theorizing of Philippine literature, including a close engagement with &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; theories, is absolutely paramount for understanding Philippine culture and for the various projects of liberation (from economic, sexual, racial, ideological subjugation) that is often the goal of their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Significantly, however, this identification does not preclude a dialogue with and/or influence on and from other schools of criticism, even those with which the specific critic might vehemently disagree. In fact, it is more often the case that an alignment with one or more schools leads to more direct and systematic engagement with diverging theories, which results in some of the most fruitful (if sometimes hostile) critical and theoretical output in Philippine scholarship. For this reason, there are often large overlaps in terms of strategies used, theorists invoked, and concerns advocated, even in spite of a different overall project. The work of Neferti Tadiar, for example, is so thoroughly enmeshed in contemporary Marxist, feminist, and postcolonial discursive practices that to place Tadiar at the bridge between the first and the second is in no way less arbitrary than placing her at the bridge between the second and the third.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Formalism as a critical tradition has undergone a paradoxical development in the last 30 years. On the one hand, it continues to be utilized in countless critical texts (including a number of the surveys above) both by critics who mostly just critique form and by those who combine the skill of critical close reading with other theories. On the other hand, it is rare to find anyone identifying primarily as a &ldquo;formalist,&rdquo; owing in part to the multiple attacks it has received from not only Marxists but also feminists, LGBTQ critics, postcolonialists, and so forth. Similarly, an identification with the endless deferment of poststructuralism is just as rare, though the deconstructive strategies themselves are constantly used for other forms of critical traditions, such as in the works of Edel Garcellano, J. Neil Garcia, and Isagani Cruz, among others. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Soledad Reyes, Bienvenido Lumbera, and Rosario Cruz-Lucero,</strong> </em><em><strong>updated by Dominic Sy, with notes from Virgilio S.

This was the first published critical statement on literature known to have been made by a Filipino. The greater significance of this statement, however, is that it indicates that the indigenous Filipinos had their own criteria for defining <a href=\"/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, distinct from those defining Spanish, or European, poetry. San Agustin&#x2019;s <b><i>Compendio</i></b> is actually a grammar book; the final chapter is a discussion and illustration of <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> versification. Here, he covers its three aspects: rhyme, meter, and genre. He also divides Tagalog poetry into two types: the dramatic, like the <b>soliranin</b>, and the <b>dalit</b>, which is serious in theme. He further enumerates other types: <b>diona</b>, <b>oyayi</b>, and <b>auit</b>."

In the mid-18th century, the state of Tagalog poetry had two commentators. Fr Melchor de Oyanguren&#x2019;s <b><i>Tagalysmo Elucidado, y Reducido [en lo Posible] a la Latinidad de Nebrija</i></b> (Tagalism Elucidated, and Reduced [Where Possible] into the Latin of Nebrija), 1742, confirmed San Agustin&#x2019;s earlier description of Tagalog poetry. The second commentator was Francisco Bencuchillo, whose <b><i>Arte Poetico Tagalo</i></b> (Art of Tagalog Poetry), 1750, published in 1895, is a more extensive description of Tagalog versification. It follows San Agustin&#x2019;s classification of rhymes but observes more possibilities for Tagalog rhyme than San Agustin did. At the turn of the 19th century, Fr Joaquin Martinez de Zu&#xF1;iga described Tagalog poetry in <b><i>Estadismo de las Islas Filipinas</i></b> (State of the Philippine Islands), based on his personal observation during poetry declamations and dramatic presentations. He gave the number of lines for various types of stanzas, the rhyming scheme, and the number of syllables per line for types of poems. The poems were invariably lyrical, usually about love or &#x201C;some minor matters pertaining to their farms.&#x201D; Among the other cultural forms that he saw were native dances accompanied by singing. These provoked his remark that the Fathers had set certain &#x201C;limits of modesty,&#x201D; a statement that explains to a great extent the absence of erotic poetry in the anthologies of the period and the lack of published secular poetry until the 19th century."

In seven chapters, he gives a general description of the types and functions of Tagalog poetry, as well as the manner in which each type is recited. The three most important chapters in this book are &#x201C;Reglas del Tayotay en Tagalog&#x201D; (Rules of Tagalog Metaphor), &#x201C;De la Poesia en Idioma Tagalog&#x201D; (Of Poetry in the Tagalog Language), and &#x201C;De los Metros del Verso Tagalog&#x201D; (Of Meters in Tagalog Verse). Coria focuses his attention on rhyme and meter, using these as basis for defining the <b>tanaga</b> (four-line stanza, with seven syllables per line) and the <a href=\"/7/55/456\"><b>comedia</b></a> (which he also described to be imitations of <i>comicos latinos</i>)."

He later translated this into Spanish, titled &#x201C;Arte Metrica del Tagalog&#x201D; (The Metrical Art of the Tagalog). This was the most thorough description of poetic conventions thus far written, noting details like the following: that a serious poem uses the dodecasyllabic line with a caesura on the sixth or seventh syllable; that a syllable may be added or removed as dictated by the meter; that, within one stanza, the monorhyming scheme may be adopted but another stanza must have a different rhyme; that a quatrain, generally composed of dodecasyllabic lines, is used for lyric poetry, and <a href=\"/9/9/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&#x2019;s poetry may serve as model; and, finally, that the <b>quintilla</b>, which generally consists of five hepta- or octosyllabic lines, is used for long narrative poetry that does not require rhetorical flourishes or imaginative elements, and the <a href=\"/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a> is a typical example. Stressing that &#x201C;free verse is not recognized&#x201D; by the Tagalog, Rizal then lists 12 kinds of rhyme, which he asserts are what distinguish Tagalog rhyme from that in any foreign literature, especially Spanish. To this date, this list of rhyming patterns still applies to Tagalog rhymed poetry."

In addition, critics such as <a href=\"/9/9/5788\">Leopoldo Yabes</a> would make the fearless forecast that the great Filipino work could be written only in English."

Already the concern for placing one&#x2019;s theoretical statements in historical context is signified by Santos&#x2019;s first chapter, which consists of a survey of the work done by the missionary critics like San Agustin, Bencuchillo, Martinez de Zu&#xF1;iga, and de Coria. The purpose of this survey is to demonstrate their failure to capture the essence of Tagalog poetry. Here, Santos declares that the missionary poets&#x2019; stress on religious versification and their own badly written verses, which they held up as models of good poetry, were largely responsible for the deterioration of Tagalog poetry, which, before Spanish intervention, was vigorous in both content and technique. He adds that the rhyming scheme of Tagalog poetry is also to be observed in that of <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a>, and other Philippine languages. This was a step toward giving a national scope to the study of Philippine poetry that Rizal had begun. At the end of his paper, Santos suggests the four periods into which the history of poetry may be divided: the pre-Hispanic, religious or mystical, revolutionary, and contemporary or philosophical."

What these works established at this point was the need to situate the text against its context&#x2014;the society from which it emerged, the functions of the text, the manner in which the work is received, and the role of the writer in the production of meaning.

In this phase of criticism, when critics were dependent on established truisms aptly summarized in the classic formulation &#x201C;dulce et utile&#x201D; (sweet and useful) as the proper function of literature, the polemical and political thrust of the critical project was to defend native culture in the face of a massive assault against it. Variations on these aforementioned concepts on the nature and function of criticism appeared in various prefaces and introductions to a large number of Tagalog novels published in the first two decades and in poetry books written by the likes of Lope K.

These attempts at constructing a history of the literary type were generally uneven in scope and depth. Nonetheless, they provided the impetus needed for the development of the critical perspective concerned primarily with establishing a framework against which the development of a particular genre could be viewed. Moreover, the critical essays have remained to this day invaluable sources of data, especially on the different stages in the development of the genre in the last decade of Spanish rule and the first decades of American rule. Two books in the series were on specific works: <b><i>Ang Lakan ng mga Makatang Pilipino na si Balagtas at ang Kanyang &#x201C;Florante&#x201D;</i></b> (The Prince of Philippine Poets Balagtas and His <b><i>Florante</i></b>), 1938, by Hermenegildo Cruz and <b><i>Si Valeriano Hernandez Pe&#xF1;a at ang Kanyang &#x201C;<a href=\"/9/77/1779\"><strong>Nena at Neneng</strong></a>&#x201D;</i></b> (Valeriano Hernandez Pe&#xF1;a and His <b><i>Nena and Neneng</i></b>), 1940, by <a href=\"/9/9/5076\">Nieves Baens del Rosario</a>.</span>"

They looked at themselves as principal agents for creating a new generation of writers more attuned to developments in Western literature. The criteria of form and universalism began to be used to measure literary works, along with a deliberate avoidance of authorial comment, emotional restraint, and the preference for artistic unity. In their newspaper columns, Abadilla&#x2019;s Mga Talaang Bughaw (Blue Lists) and del Mundo&#x2019;s Ang Tao sa Parolang Ginto (The Person in the Golden Lighthouse), they evaluated the poems and short stories being written during this time and selected what they deemed to be the best of the lot."

A centerpiece in this curriculum was English as a subject with both the grammar and the literature components. Among the more famous teachers during this period were Dean S.

They taught not only the rudiments of English grammar but also and more importantly the works of English and American writers.

In 1910, the first issue of the University of the Philippines&#x2019; <b><i>College Folio</i></b> contained a study of the metrical romance by Wilfrido de Leon, the <b>comedia </b>in Zambales by Alejandro Dumlao, and the <a href=\"/7/55/445\"><b>carrillo</b></a> by Frank X.

But even early on, such qualities as sentimentalism, didacticism, excessive lyricism, and stereotyped characters were viewed as detracting from the quality of any work. Thus, the foundation was laid for criticism that eschewed precisely those qualities which characterized much of literature in the local languages. Works that explored new dimensions in literary expression were consequently privileged over those that did not. More than anything else, the skillful use of technique assured discovery and renown. <a href=\"/9/80/5486\">Federico Mangahas</a>, <a href=\"/9/80/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5457\">Alfredo Elfren Litiatco</a>, and their contemporaries articulated the principles of fine writing or belles lettres."

In his book <b><i>Literature and Society</i></b>, 1940, Lopez advanced a literary theory of social consciousness that has become a dominant school of thought in Philippine letters. On the other hand, Yabes pioneered in the study of Philippine ethnic and regional literature, first with his article on <b><i><a href=\"/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a></i></b>, 1934, and then with <b><i>A Brief Survey of Iloco Literature</i></b>, 1935. These two works show how the presence of a seductive foreign language and literature did not completely overwhelm the native consciousness of social reality. Wielding the newly acquired articulateness in English, some Filipino writers took issue with the direction that fine writing was taking their English-besotted colleagues. The result of this literary critique was a body of social commentaries in which the craft of writing is prized, not for its intrinsic value of self-expression, but for its power to interpret and change the world. It was during this period that a kind of polarization took place in criticism. The first tendency was represented by Jose Garcia Villa, and simplistically perceived as hewing closely to the doctrine of <i>ars gratia artis</i> (art for art&#x2019;s sake), where the aesthetic qualities held preeminence. The second tendency was manifested in Lopez, who was influenced by the sociological approach shaped by Marxism, then asserting itself as a critical school of thought and a political movement in the United States. The polar positions asked what the nature of the literature is and what its role in Philippine society is."

As a result, a spirited debate took place which led the board of judges for the Commonwealth Literary Contests to declare that a writer was worthy of recognition only if his work used as reference &#x201C;the social matrix in which our humanity exists.&#x201D; Two leading critics who refused to subscribe to &#x201C;proletarian literature&#x201D; were <a href=\"/9/80/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a> and A.

For the critics in the local languages, literature was always a text or a theme with which the ordinary reader could identify: thus, the mimetic theory appeared to be the central source of insights. The text&#x2019;s linkages with history, the writer, and the audience were never in doubt, even as the critics displayed a deep historical sense. This tendency was to be challenged by the young critics who were members of Panitikan in the 1930s. Criticism in English, on the other hand, shaped by the Romantic theory of art as creation, stressed the autonomy of literary texts and emphasized the relationship between the author and the piece of work. This notion, rooted in the expressive theory of art, found its most powerful defender in Jose Garcia Villa. But this position was roundly criticized by the group headed by Salvador Lopez as irrelevant, especially in the context of specific historical experiences&#x2014;in particular, the two colonial periods, which had followed each other only a generation earlier."

Generally, the texts followed a basic formalist orientation even as the analysis focused principally on the text and its formal characteristics. The approach was both descriptive and evaluative, a tendency which was most clearly exhibited in most of the essays included in the various anthologies. Writers who studied in the writing centers of Kenyon and Iowa were <a href=\"/9/9/5727\">Edilberto</a> and <a href=\"/9/80/5728\">Edith L. Tiempo</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5344\">N. V. M. Gonzalez</a>, Bienvenido Santos, and Ricaredo Demetillo. Edilberto Tiempo&#x2019;s &#x201C;Form in Filipino Fiction,&#x201D; 1953, was one of the earliest demonstrations of the New Critical method. However, the method drew some complaints for the tendency of some of its practitioners toward rigidity, dogmatism, and esoterics. <a href=\"/9/9/5168\">Jose Luna Castro</a> spoke for others when he remarked in the <b><i>Literary Apprentice</i></b>, 1955, &#x201C;It is difficult to read, it defies lay understanding; it is written, one suspects, for fellow critics and the handful of intellectuals on the campuses.&#x201D; In a more caustic vein, <a href=\"/9/80/5746\">Juan C. Tuvera</a> dismissed the recent trends in critical writing as the cultivation of &#x201C;double-talk to stampede the innocence and the very essence of life out of the present literary scene &#x2026; One must now, like a cold-blooded hound, pursue the spoor of the Symbol and, among the under brush of language, track down that villainous Meaning.&#x201D;"

Continuing the dialectic begun in the Commonwealth period, Yabes offered an alternative to New Criticism by advocating a sociological and historical approach, thus locating the literary work within the moment and the milieu. Meanwhile, classical criticism with a moralistic bent was encouraged by the Ateneo journal <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>, begun in 1953, and led by <a href=\"/9/9/5118\">Miguel Bernad</a><a href=\"/9/9/5118\">, SJ</a>. Another exception to the formalist thrust was Hosillos&#x2019;s work, which used a comparative and historical approach.

Distinctly formalist in orientation, these young critics viewed traditional writing and criticism associated with the older critics as sorely in need of openness to Western literary influences. Well-read in the criticism of the formalist school and exposed to the modern techniques of such writers as Pablo Neruda, John Steinbeck, W. H. Auden, the French Symbolists, among many others, this group proceeded to do a critique of the existing modes of literary analysis. They found fault with the moralistic, historical approaches of the older critics and criticized the dependence of I&#xF1;igo Ed. Regalado and company on literary theories already supplanted by the more vigorous and powerful formalist doctrines. The major work of criticism written in Filipino in the early 1970s was Virgilio S. Almario&#x2019;s <b><i>Ang Makata sa Panahon ng Makin</i>a</b> (The Poet in the Machine Age), 1971, which was a compilation of his essays published in the 1960s.

But also at that point, a certain rigor had begun to characterize literary criticism, particularly in the close reading or analysis of text. Although largely untheorized, a large number of critical works during this period seemed to have benefited from the critics&#x2019; deepening realization of the nature and function of criticism as a separate discipline. By using formalist canons with understanding, the critic&#x2019;s task became clearer: the exegesis of the text with a view to providing an intelligent interpretation of its meaning."

This has led in turn to problematizing the place of regional traditions vis-&#xE0;-vis the &#x201C;national.&#x201D; In &#x201C;Harnessing Regional Literature for National Literature,&#x201D; Bienvenido Lumbera defines national literature as a body of work that invokes and projects the imagined community of the Filipino nation. He points out, however, that the traditional classification of national literature has been filtered through both class as well as language, with &#x201C;regional&#x201D; literature being comprised of the tradition written in the local languages, and &#x201C;national&#x201D; literature being written in Spanish, English, and Tagalog. Both filters were a product of an elite and colonial educational system, with the mistaken belief that what they had construed as &#x201C;national&#x201D; was superior to everything else. In the end, however, Lumbera maintains the categories of &#x201C;regional&#x201D; and &#x201C;national,&#x201D; by which he means works that are focused on narrower local settings versus works that grapple with bigger perspectives of nationhood. He charges that more works from the regions need to be translated into Filipino so as to be able to find which of them belong to &#x201C;national&#x201D; literature, so as to have a more representative example of the concept of the Philippine nation."

In contrast (or perhaps in tandem) with the forces of globalization, the turn of the millennium has seen a resurgence in interest for the local literary traditions, both for writers and critics alike. Continuing the developments in Philippine studies in the 1970s, scholars are still recording, examining, and disseminating much of the cultural material across the archipelago. A large number of the books produced by scholars are surveys and/or anthologies of the said materials with historical contexts that tackle the development of, say, a local literary form. On the other hand, other critical works are dissections of Philippines cultural texts through a combination of empirical data and various strategies culled from different critical traditions and methodologies, especially Marxism, cultural (and historical) materialism, feminism, postcolonialism, and cultural studies. Generally, these strategies and theories are not imposed on the data but are instead used as flexible frameworks for a primarily inductive analysis. In doing so, the reconfiguration of these frameworks yields a greater understanding of both Philippine culture and the theories."

In one essay, he contrasts the journey of Philippine <a href=\"/9/73/1549\">epic </a>heroes and the journeys of contemporary overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), thus deconstructing the government&#x2019;s use of the label &#x201C;bagong bayani&#x201D; (new hero) for OFWs and revealing the exploitative and dehumanizing character of the state-sponsored enterprise. This reading practice reaffirms the transformative potential of literature, one that may be recruited for the creation of a truly just and nationalist society."

According to Rafael, the Spaniards saw translation (including the formalization of Tagalog grammar) as a way to subsume the Tagalog language into a semantic hierarchy that privileged Latin and Castilian as means of access to God. Translation thus served the Spanish purposes of domination and control. However, the Tagalog translated the Spaniards with a different purpose: the accumulation of words and signs into their own preexisting paradigms. Thus, for example, while the Spanish attempted to contract the meanings of words like <i>utang na loob</i> (debt of gratitude) and <i>hiya</i> (shame) in light of the man&#x2019;s dependent relationship with God, the Tagalog understood this relationship (and so their relationships with <i>Dios</i>, Hesus, Maria, etc.) in light of their own notions of reciprocal debt-relationships.

The term <b>literary publishing</b> refers to the process of production: from the selection and editing of the literary work for publication, to the printing or uploading and distribution or dissemination of the final version of the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"presses\" name=\"presses\"></a>The Early Printing Presses</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">During the Spanish colonial period, the religious orders owned the printing presses and thus dominated the publishing of literary as well as nonliterary works. From 1593 to 1811, more than 1,000 titles were published in the Philippines. Majority of these works were religious, such as church regulations, homilies, lives of saints, novenas, pastoral letters, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a>, and spiritual guides. Among the published secular works were grammars and vocabularies of various Philippine languages, historical accounts, treatises on logic, and scientific texts. Miscellaneous tracts on government matters such as decrees and regulations were also produced. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Dominicans produced the first books of the Philippines. In 1593, the order published <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1600\"><b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola y Tagala</i></b></a> (Christian Doctrine in Spanish and Tagalog), with the material based on the Tagalog translations of Fr Juan de Plasencia, which had been edited by other priests. That same year, the Dominicans also published <b><i>X?nk&egrave; S?ngsh? G?om?-xi&agrave;n Zhu&agrave;n W&uacute;j&iacute; Ti?nzh? Zh&egrave;ngji&agrave;o Zh?nchu&aacute;n Sh&iacute;l&ugrave;</i></b>; A Printed Edition of the Veritable Record of the Authentic Tradition of the True Faith in the Infinite God, by the Religious Master G?om?-xi&agrave;n, 1593, or <b><i>Hsin-k&rsquo;o Seng shih Kao Mu-hsien Chaun Wu chi T&rsquo;ien chu Cheng Chiao Chen-ch&rsquo;uan Shih lu</i></b><i> </i>in the Wade-Giles system. This is a treatise on theology, cosmography, and natural history written by Fr Juan Cobo, the G?om?-xi&agrave;n (or Kao Mu-hsien) of the title. Both books were printed in Manila, using a method called xylography, which involves the use of woodblocks.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1604, typography, which is printing by movable type, was introduced in the Philippines by Fr Francisco Blancas de San Jose and the Chinese Christian printer Juan de Vera. Two books were produced that year by the Dominican press using the new method: <b><i>Libro de las Quatro Postrimerias del Hombre en Lengua Tagala, y Letra Espa&ntilde;ola </i></b>(The Book on the Four Last Things of Man in Tagalog and Spanish) and <b><i>Ordinationes Generales Provintiae Sanctissimi Rosarii Philippinarum</i></b> (The General Ordinances of the Philippine Province of the Holy Rosary).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other religious orders also published their works through their own printing presses. The Augustinians established theirs, the second in the Philippines, in 1618. They had imported the machinery from Japan in 1565 and set it up in Bacolor, eventually moving to Manila in 1621. In 1623, they sold the press to the Jesuits. The Augustinians established another printing press in 1886 in Guadalupe, transferring it to Malabon in 1890, where it was known as Peque&ntilde;a Imprenta del Asilo de Huerfanos de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Consolacion. With the machinery they had acquired from the Augustinians, the Jesuits established their printing press in 1623 at the Colegio de San Ignacio in Manila, and used it to print their works until their expulsion in 1768. Returning to the Philippines after a hundred years, they acquired another press in 1897 and printed the publications of the Jesuit Weather Observatory in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Franciscans set up their printing press in Sampaloc, Manila, in 1692, then moved it to Tayabas, now Quezon, in 1700. This press was transferred to several places: the Franciscan convent in Manila from 1705 to 1712; the Convent de la Candelaria in Dilao, now Paco, from 1713 to 1714; again, in Manila, from 1714 to 1736; and the Convento of Our Lady of Loreto in Sampaloc, where it stayed until 1822.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early printing presses were initially operated by Chinese immigrants. In the early 17th century, Filipinos became active in printing, with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5598\">Tomas Pinpin</a> as the leading figure among them. In 1610, the Dominican press published Blancas de San Jose&rsquo;s <b><i>Arte y Reglas de la Lengua Tagala</i></b><i> </i>(Grammar and Rules of the Tagalog Language), which was printed by Pinpin. That same year saw the publication of Pinpin&rsquo;s <b><i>Librong Pagaaralan nang manga Tagalog nang Uicang Castila</i></b><i> </i>(A Book for the Tagalog to Study the Spanish Language), the first book authored by a Filipino; it was printed by another Tagalog, Diego Talaghay, also for the Dominican press. In 1613, Pedro de San Buenaventura&rsquo;s <b><i>Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala </i></b>(Vocabulary of the Tagalog Language) was printed by Pinpin and Domingo Laog, also a Tagalog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">As printing progressed in the Philippines, books written by Spanish priests in other local languages were published. The first of these were <b><i>Doctrina Christiana Rob. Bellarmini in Linguam <strong>Bisaya</strong>m Translata</i></b><i> </i>in Visayan by Cristobal Jimenez, issued in 1610; <b><i>Arte de la Lengua Pampanga</i> </b>(Grammar of the Kapampangan Language) by Francisco Coronel, 1617; <b><i>Libro a Naisuratanamin a Bagas ti Doctrina Cristiana</i></b><i> </i>in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> by Francisco Lopez, 1621; and <b><i>Arte de la Lengua Bicolana</i></b><i> </i>(Grammar of the Bikol Language) by Andres de San Agustin, 1647. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"growth\" name=\"growth\"></a>The Growth of Printing in the 19th Century</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1830s, with Manila opened to international trade and other cities following suit, private commercial presses began to be established in the Philippines. Among the more prominent enterprises in Manila were Los Amigos del Pais, founded in 1846; Ramirez y Giraudier, 1858; Don Esteban Balbas, 1880; and Chofre y Compa&ntilde;ia, 1880. This development would lead eventually to breaking the monopoly on printing and publishing held by the religious orders. It also ushered in technological advances in printing. In 1847, Fr Marcial Funcia Ramos introduced the first iron press in the country. He also replaced the use of <i>papel de arroz </i>(rice paper) and <i>papel de china </i>(Chinese paper) with <i>papel de hilo </i>(linen paper) for quality printing, Belgian paper for newspapers, and French paper for other works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lithography, a printing method using stone surfaces, was introduced in the Philippines by a German, George Oppel, in 1858. Collaborating with the firm of the Spanish printers Manuel Ramirez and Baltasar Giraudier, Oppel printed the <b><i>La Ilustracion Filipina</i></b>, the first illustrated periodical in the Philippines. The Carmelo and Bauermann Printing Press, established in 1887 by Eulalio Lakandula Carmelo and William Bauermann, also utilized the lithographic process.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cavite was reported to have a printing press as early as 1814 with Tomas de Oliva, a Filipino, as its regent. In Cebu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2652\">Domingo de Escondrillas</a> established the first printing press in 1873. The first printing press in Iloilo was Imprenta Enriqueta, which published the province&rsquo;s first newspaper, the <b><i>Hoja Volante</i></b>, in 1875. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5588\">Mariano Perfecto</a> established the Imprenta La Panayana in Mandurriao, Iloilo, in 1877. The press survived until 1965, publishing not only religious books but also <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a>,<i> </i><b>korido</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a>),<i> </i><b>nobela</b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a>), and <b>berso</b> (verse). In 1892, Perfecto also established the Imprenta Sagrada Familia in Nueva Caceres, now Naga City, which published religious pamphlets, metrical romances, and devotionals. In Vigan, Ilocos Sur, Imprenta Ecclesiastica was operating in 1884. In Manila, Sampaloc became the center of the printing industry, with presses operating in Daang Imprenta, now G. Tuason. Among the establishments found in this area were the Imprenta de Sampaloc, 1838-46, owned by the Spaniard Antonio de Llanes y Valdez; the Plana y Compa&ntilde;ia, 1870-82, later placed under the direction of Salvador Chofre y Compa&ntilde;ia, 1882-98; La Opinion and El Eco de Filipinas, 1889-93, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5630\">I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado</a> as regent; and Manila Imprenta de Santa Cruz, owned by a Filipino, Jose de Jesus y Rosario.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"publications\" name=\"publications\"></a>Literary Publications during the Spanish Colonial Period</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine literary publishing began in the early 17th century when Tagalog poetry appeared as supplementary material in religious publications. Local literature came to be published in books of their own beginning in the 18th century. Owing to censorship enforced by the Spanish government, the Church monopoly on printing, and the interests of the authors who were mostly members of the clergy, the literature that appeared in print was primarily religious and didactic. The publications were in the forms of the pasyon, the &ldquo;life of the saint,&rdquo; and the metrical romance. In the 19th century, when secular literature was allowed to be published, the works that appeared were mainly in the metrical romance form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pasyon is a verse narrative of the Passion of Christ. The first such work was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1898\"><b><i>Mahal na Passion ni Jesu Christong Panginoon Natin na Tola at Ipinanagang sa Cataastaasang Poong Jesus Nazareno</i></b></a> (Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Verse and Dedicated to the Highest Lord Jesus the Nazarene), written by the Tagalog printer and author <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5056\">Gaspar Aquino de Belen</a>. It was published in 1703 by the Jesuit press in one volume together with <b><i>Manga Panalanging Pagtatagobilin sa Caloloua nang Tauong Naghihingalo</i></b> (Prayers of Commendation for the Soul of the Dying), a Tagalog translation by Aquino de Belen of the Spanish version of <b><i>Ordo Commendationis <strong>Ani</strong>marum</i></b><i> </i>by Fr Thomas de Villacastin. Other Tagalog versions of the pasyon appeared after Aquino de Belen&rsquo;s work: <b><i>Pasion de Nuestro Se&ntilde;or Jesucristo</i> </b>(Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ) by Don Luis Guian, published in 1740; <b><i>Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa</i></b><i> </i>(The Story of the Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ That Should Inflame the Heart of the Reader) by an anonymous writer, 1814; and <b><i>El Libro de la Vida: Historia Sagrada con Santas Reflexiones y Doctrinas <strong>Moral</strong>es para la Vida Cristiana en Verso Tagalo</i> </b>(The Book of Life: Sacred History with Pious Reflections and Moral Teachings for the Christian Life Written in Tagalog Verse) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5233\">Fr Aniceto de la Merced</a>, 1852.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal</i></b><i> </i>was the most popular of all the Tagalog versions of the pasyon. It came to be known as the <b><i><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong> Pilapil</i></b>, after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5594\">Fr Mariano Pilapil</a>, one of the several priests who revised the original anonymous text. Various versions of the pasyon in the other local languages began to appear in the mid-1880s. Pasyon works continue to be printed to this day. Aside from being read aloud or chanted as the <i>pabasa</i> (reading) during Holy Week, the pasyon has also been adapted for stage as the <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\">sinakulo</a> </i>(passion play), which is performed during the Lenten season as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The &ldquo;life of the saint&rdquo; form was written in prose or verse. These accounts of the lives and deeds of saints appeared in brief form as prefatory material in novenas or in extended form as narratives in pamphlets, some as full-length books. One particularly popular book was <b><i>Aral na Tunay na Totoong Pagaacay sa Tauo nang manga Cabanalang Gaua nang Manga Maloualhating Santos na sina Barlaan at Josaphat </i></b>(Actual Lessons in Guiding People to Truth, Based on the Holy Works of the Glorious Saints Barlaan and Josaphat), translated from Spanish into Tagalog by Fr Antonio de Borja and published by the Jesuit press in 1712. It was reprinted in the 19th century. A new critical edition of the work, <b><i>Barlaan at Josaphat: Modernisadong Edisyon ng Salin ni Fray Antonio de Borja</i></b><i> </i>(Barlaan and Josaphat: A Modernized Edition of the Translation by Fray Antonio de Borja), edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5033\">Virgilio S. Almario</a>, was published by the Ateneo de Manila University (ADMU) Press in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The metrical romances of the Philippines came in two types: the dodecasyllabic awit and the octosyllabic korido. The romances were transmitted orally by the colonizers; they came to be produced by Filipinos and eventually written down beginning in the 18th century. They were circulated in manuscript, memorized, and sung by local bards. Their sources were the sagas of Charlemagne, Arthur, and the Fall of Troy; the legends and history of Spain and the Spanish <b>libros de caballerias</b><i> </i>(chivalry books); local folklore; the lives of the saints and the Bible. Like the pasyon, the awit and korido were adapted for performance: they were quoted in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><b>duplo</b></a> (oral verse contests), and their plots were used in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/445\"><b>carillo</b></a> (shadowgraphs) and the <i>moro-moro</i> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The printing of metrical romances likely began in the late 18th century, but no copies from that period have survived. In the 19th century, they were produced in large numbers in various local languages. In Tagalog alone there were around 200 titles published, among them <b><i>Ang Pinagdaanang Buhay nang Princesa Adriana sa Caharian nang Antioquia at nang Principe Pantinople sa Imperiong Francia</i> </b>(The Life of Princess Adriana in the Kingdom of Antioquia and of Prince Pantinople in the Empire of France), <b><i>Corridong Mariquit Pag-aliwan na Buhay nang Princesa Celira</i></b> (Corrido for Pleasant Entertainment on the Life of Princess Celira), <b><i>Corrido at Pinagdaanang Buhay nang Principe Baldovino sa Caharian nang Daces</i> </b>(Corrido and Life Experienced by Prince Baldovino in the Kingdom of Daces), and <b><i>Pinagdaanang Buhay nang Principe D. Juan Te&ntilde;oso</i></b><i> </i>(Life Experienced by Prince Don Juan Te&ntilde;oso), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1849\"><b><i>Historia Famosa ni <strong>Bernardo Carpio</strong></i></b></a><i> </i>(Famous History of Bernardo Carpio). The metrical romances of the 19th century were printed as thin, cheap pamphlets, and were sold not only in bookshops but also in sidewalk stalls, outside churches, and by itinerant peddlers. Metrical romances would continue to be printed until the early decades of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most popular and most important of the Philippine metrical romances is <b><i>Pinagdaanang Buhay ni <strong>Florante</strong> at ni Laura sa Kahariang Albania</i></b> (Life Experienced by Florante and Laura in the Kingdom of Albania), written in awit form by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>, aka Balagtas. It is significant for its artistry as an accomplished piece of Tagalog poetry and for its allegorical depiction of the sufferings of the Filipino people under the oppressive Spanish colonial regime. <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></a></strong></i></b><i> </i>first appeared in 1838, printed in Manila by the Colegio de Santo Tomas press. Since then, nearly 100 editions of the poem have been issued by various publishers. It has seen print in many forms such as prose versions and comic books, and in translations in other Philippine and foreign languages. It has also been adapted for various performances, such as drama and dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">In the 19th century, drama began to be published in the Philippines, although plays had been staged in the country as early as 1598. The Imprenta de la Oceania Espa&ntilde;ola published local editions of Spanish plays, such as <b><i>Gracia del Canto</i></b> (Grace of the Song) and <b><i>La Conquista de Jolo</i></b> (The Conquest of Jolo) in 1865; <b><i>El Alcalde de Zalamea</i> </b>(The Mayor of Zalamea), 1880; and <b><i>El Castigo sin Venganza</i></b> (Punishment without Vengeance), 1881. The press also published Spanish translations of the works of Shakespeare and Goethe in the 1880s. Other plays published during this period were Antonio Robles&rsquo;s one-act comedy <b><i>Salir a Tiempo de Pobr</i>e</b> (Leaving Poverty in Time), 1852, by Imprenta de Santo Tomas; and Federico Bouvier&rsquo;s one-act comedy <b><i>Amor de Alojamiento</i></b> (The Love of Lodging), 1860, by Imprenta de los Amigos del Pais.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The<b> </b>komedya<i> </i>was the most popular form in Philippine theater during the Spanish colonial period. A play in verse typically about princes and princesses of Christian and Muslim kingdoms in Europe during the Middle Ages, the komedya was written in several Philippine languages. They were published during the last decades of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th. Among the plays that saw print were <b><i>Comedia de Atamante</i></b> (Comedia of Atamante) and <b><i>Comedia de Rolante y Claudina</i></b> (Comedia of Rolante and Claudina), both printed in 1895 by Imprenta de los Amigos del Pais; <b><i>Comedia de D. Juan Te&ntilde;oso en Dos Actos</i></b> (Comedia of D. Juan Te&ntilde;oso in Two Acts), 1903, by Imprenta Dulumbayan in Santa Cruz, Manila; and <b><i>Belmore y Enriqueta</i></b> (Belmore and Enriqueta), 1904, by Fajardo y Compa&ntilde;ia in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prose narratives began to be published in the late 19th century. Among them were the works of Francisco de Paula Entrala, all printed by Imprenta el Porvenir Filipino: <b><i>La Rubia de Quiapo</i></b> (The Fair-Haired One of Quiapo), 1874; <b><i>La Morena de Sampaloc</i></b> (The Brown Maiden of Sampaloc), 1875; and <b><i>Los Amores de un Pintor </i></b>(The Loves of a Painter), 1874. The same press also printed Antonio Vasquez de Aldana&rsquo;s <b><i>Maria la Vivandera</i></b><i> </i>(Maria the Provisioner) in 1874. Another work by Vasquez, <b><i>Los Tulisanes Negros, <strong>Novel</strong>a de Jimenez</i></b><i> </i>(The Black Bandits, Novel of Jimenez), 1874, was published by Botella y Compa&ntilde;ia. The Imprenta de la Oceania Espa&ntilde;ola in Manila printed three works by Jose F. del Pan: <b><i>El Aderezo de Paquita</i></b> (The Ornaments of Paquita) in 1887; <b><i>El Caballero de Copas</i></b> (The Knight of Cups), 1887; and <b><i>Otra Especie de Fausto </i></b>(Another Kind of Faust), 1887.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The prose narrative recognized as the first Filipino novel, however, was published not in the Philippines but in Spain. This work is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1780\"><strong>Ninay: Costumbres Filipinas</strong></a></i></b> (Ninay: Philippine Customs) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5576\">Pedro A. Paterno</a>, printed by Imprenta de Fortanet in Madrid in 1885. It was likely published by Paterno himself&mdash;that is, he paid for its printing and arranged its distribution himself. This was a common course of action for many Filipino novelists who followed him, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>. Self-publishing in Philippine literature is not an unusual practice, and it continues to be observed to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rizal published <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b> (Touch Me Not) in Berlin, Germany, in 1887 and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Subversion) in Ghent, Belgium, in 1891. The novels, both written in Spanish, were satirical depictions of 19th-century Philippine society and were immensely influential in the Philippine Revolution against Spain. <b><i>Noli Me Tangere </i></b>was first translated into Tagalog by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5599\">Pascual H. Poblete</a> in an edition that came out in 1906, published by Rizal&rsquo;s sister Saturnina Rizal-Hidalgo and printed by Limbagan nang El Mercantil in Manila. The first Tagalog translation of <b><i>El Filibusterismo</i></b> was by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a>, published in 1911 by I. R. Morales in Manila. The novels have been translated into other languages, both local and foreign, and issued in numerous editions throughout the years up to the present. They have been adapted in various literary forms, such as children&rsquo;s books and comic books, as well as for performance on stage and in film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"reformist\" name=\"reformist\"></a>Reformist and Revolutionary Publications</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 19th century, aside from Rizal&rsquo;s novels, publications appeared that pressed for the reform of Spanish rule in the Philippines and, later, revolution against the Spanish government. Early efforts were in the form of periodicals published by Filipino reformists in Spain: <b><i>El Eco Filipino</i></b>, a fortnightly magazine launched in 1871 and banned in 1872; the <b><i>Revista del Circulo Hispano-Filipino</i></b>, 1882, which folded after its second issue; and the weekly newspaper <b><i>Espa&ntilde;a en Filipinas</i></b>, 1887. It was <b><i>La Solidaridad</i></b>, however, that became the principal organ of the propaganda movement. Founded on 15 Feb 1889 in Barcelona, the newspaper lasted until 15 Nov 1895. Edited initially by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5463\">Graciano Lopez Jaena</a> and later by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>, <b><i>La Solidaridad</i></b> published essays in Spanish exposing abuses of the Spanish authorities in the Philippines and demanding social and political freedom, education, and equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, writings critical of Spanish rule were distributed or published or distributed in clandestine or creative ways. Del Pilar&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1596\"><strong>Dasalan at Tocsohan</strong></a></i></b> (Prayers and Temptations/Jokes), ca. 1888, which parodied The Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the Hail Mary, the Apostle&rsquo;s Creed, and the Ten Commandments, was published as a pamphlet in the format of novenas. Lopez Jaena&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1608\"><strong>Fray Botod</strong></a></i></b> (Friar Potbelly), ca. 1889, which depicted the vices and abuses of the friars, was circulated only in manuscript form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reformist and revolutionary periodicals were published in the country as well, led by the short-lived <b><i>Diariong Tagalog</i></b>, which appeared in 1882 and was edited by del Pilar. The more influential publication in the movement against the Spanish, however, was <b><i><strong>Kala</strong>yaan</i></b>, the official organ of the Katipunan. Its first issue appeared in 1896, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5393\">Emilio Jacinto</a>. It contained an editorial on solidarity and independence, a poem by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>, a manifesto by Jacinto urging revolution, and an article by Pio Valenzuela on the abuses of friars and civil guards. The publication was distributed in Manila and the neighboring provinces. It proved to be vital to the growth of the Katipunan, as the society gained thousands of new members after the first issue was released. The second issue of <b><i>Kalayaan</i></b> never saw print because the Philippine Revolution against Spain had broken out as it was being prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1898 to 1910, some 33 nationalist periodicals were published. Among those which featured revolutionary literature were <b><i>El Renacimiento</i></b>, 3 Sep 1901&ndash;30 Jan 1910; <b><i>Ang Bayang Kahapis-hapis</i></b>, 1899, which published articles and poetry; <b><i>Filipinas</i></b>, 1900-1901, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a> and containing articles, essays, and poetry; <b><i>El Pueblo</i></b>, a weekly illustrated newspaper published by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5707\">Vicente Sotto</a> in Cebu; <b><i>La Alborada</i></b>, 5 Oct 1901, a weekly periodical containing the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5419\">Teodoro M. Kalaw</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5349\">Fernando Ma. Guerrero</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5766\">Pacifico Victoriano</a>; <b><i>Muling Pagsilang</i></b>, 1901-10, the Tagalog edition of <b><i>El Renacimiento</i></b>, which published articles, essays, and satirical caricatures; <b><i>Asamblea Filipina</i></b>, begun on 14 Oct 1907, which featured articles and poems; <b><i>Balagtas</i></b>, 1907-10, with writers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5689\">Lope K.

While the literary section or supplement was only a portion of most magazines in English, those in Tagalog, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, Hiligaynon, and Ilocano thrived because of the serialized novels and the short stories. The dependence of the novel on periodicals for publication entailed the observance of certain formulas and conventions: a series of interweaving narratives to sustain the reader&rsquo;s interest, simple characterization, and language that resorts to formulaic and stock phrases. <b><i>Ang Kapatid ng Bayan</i></b> published the early Tagalog novels in serial form. Among them were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5306\">Gabriel Beato Francisco</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Cababalaghan ni P. Bravo</i></b> (The Miracle of Fr. Bravo), 1899, which is acknowledged as the first published novel in Tagalog; Lope K. Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Salawahang Pag-ibig</i></b> (Inconstant Love), 1900; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5374\">Valeriano Hernandez Pe&ntilde;a</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Rosa at Valerio</i></b> (Rosa and Valerio), 1901.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The novel was a new genre in Philippine literature, and it was received enthusiastically by readers, who were said to have bought the periodicals of the day not for the news but for the serialized novels. The period 1905-21 is recognized as the &ldquo;golden age of the Tagalog novel&rdquo; for the rapid development of the genre and the prolific production of works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was more common for novels in Tagalog and the other local languages to be published as serials in periodicals rather than as books. The titles that appeared as books usually had been issued in installments in periodicals before being published in full-length, complete arrangement. Among the Tagalog magazines that regularly featured serialized fiction were<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\"><i>Liwayway</i></a></b>, first issued in 1922; <b><i><strong>Sampaguita</strong></i></b>, <b><i>Dalaga</i></b>, and <b><i><strong>Paraluman</strong></i></b>, 1925; <b><i>Hiwaga</i></b> and <b><i><strong>Aliw</strong>an</i></b><i> </i>in the 1940s; and <b><i>Bulaklak</i></b> in the 1950s. <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, which initially appeared in 1922 as <b><i>Photo News</i></b>, was a weekly magazine published by Ramon Roces Publishing Company. With a circulation that grew from 3,000 to 80,000 in a few years, it became the primary literary outlet in Tagalog and eventually the most commercially successful magazine in the Philippines. Among its first writers were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5313\">Fausto Galauran</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5198\">Jose Esperanza Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5692\">Antonio Sempio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5691\">Teofilo Sauco</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5662\">Deogracias Rosario</a>. <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> periodically held literary contests, which served to launch the careers of some important writers in Tagalog. The contest in Jul 1925 led to the discovery of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5177\">Gregorio Coching</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5307\">Lazaro Francisco</a>, Venancio Ascal, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5780\">Teodoro Virrey</a>. Another contest in the 1960s started the careers of modernist writers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5634\">Edgardo M. Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5515\">Dominador Mirasol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5002\">Efren Abueg</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5543\">Rogelio Ordo&ntilde;ez</a>, and Rogelio Sikat aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5698\">Rogelio Sicat</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During World War II, <b><i>Liwayway</i> </b>was the only Filipino-owned publication allowed by the Japanese Military Administration to operate. Literary works were paid well to encourage writing in Tagalog, resulting in the submission of fiction and verses in haiku form. The best works of fiction of this period were compiled into an anthology titled <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/1981\"><b><i>Ang 25 Pinakamabuting Maikling Kathang Pilipino ng</i></b><i> <b>1943</b></i></a> (The 25 Best Pilipino Short Stories of 1943), 1944. <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> continues to be published today by the Manila Bulletin Publishing Corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The periodicals <b><i>Freeman</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5077\"><strong>Bag-ong Kusog</strong></a></i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5121\"><b><i>Bisaya</i></b></a>, and <b><i>Tabunon Lamdag</i></b> were the early outlets of Cebuano fiction, publishing the works of Angel Enemedo, Vicente Dutere, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5075\">Natalia Bacalso</a>, Florentino Suico, Vicente <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>Flores</strong></a>, Vicente Arias, Jacinto Alcos, Elpidio Villacrucis. <b><i>Bisaya</i></b>, first issued in 1930, was published by Liwayway Publications in Manila. It dominated Cebuano magazine publishing. First edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5551\">Vicente Padriga</a>, it grew from an initial circulation of 5,000 to 60,000 in the 1960s. The magazine ceased operations during World War II, continued in 1946, and gave birth to a sister publication, <b><i>Saloma</i></b>, in 1948. A literary pamphlet, <b><i>Saloma</i></b> appeared monthly and carried a complete novel in a single issue. It lasted until the 1950s. <b><i>Bisaya</i></b> is published today also by the Manila Bulletin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Kadapig sang <strong>Banwa</strong></i></b> and <b><i>Makinaugalingon</i></b>, 1913-41, the first outlets for Hiligaynon literature, featured the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5396\">Magdalena Jalandoni</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">Flavio Zaragoza Cano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5739\">Serapion Torre</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3116\">Jose Nava</a>. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5383\"><b><i>Hiligaynon</i></b></a>, 1934-74, originally called<b> <i>Ang Bisaya sa Hiligaynon</i></b>, was published by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5618\">Ramon Roces Publications</a>.

Hernando, Benito S. de Castro, Arturo Centeno, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5570\">Benjamin Pascual</a>. <b><i>Bannawag</i></b><i> </i>ceased publication in 1941 at the outbreak of World War II and resumed in 1945. In 1956, the Ilocano orthography started to be patterned after Pilipino. In 1961, the magazine initiated literary contests. The circulation of <b><i>Bannawag</i></b> in the late 20th century was 40,000. It is published today by the Manila Bulletin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, among the venues for literary publication was the newspaper <b><i>An Pabareta</i></b>, first published in 1933 and resumed in 1954, which had among its editors Eustaquio Dino and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5212\">Luis G. Dato</a>. It featured Bikol poetry, stories, and essays. Other periodicals were <b><i>Bikol Forum</i></b>, begun in 1971, which published essays on Bikol culture; <b><i>Bicol Chronicle</i></b>, which occasionally published literary pieces; <b><i>The Bicol Guardian</i></b><i> </i>(formerly <b><i>Premier News</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>The Inquirer</i></b>), begun in 1969, which published Bikol myths, legends, and folktales. <b><i>Bikolandia Magazine</i></b>, edited by Tomas Kilates, also published fiction, devoting majority of its pages to short stories and novels. It gave out annual awards to writers as well. <b><i>The <strong>Rainbow</strong></i></b>, begun in 1965, a monthly Christian magazine, also published poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For writings in English, periodicals also served as early important venues. Among the first to publish literary works were the <b><i>Philippine Teacher</i></b>, founded in 1904, which later became <b><i>Philippine Education</i></b><i> </i>and then <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></i></b>; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></i></b>, 1908; <b><i>Woman&rsquo;s Home Journal</i></b>, 1919, the first women&rsquo;s magazine in the Philippines; <b><i>Philippines Herald</i></b>, 1920, the first daily newspaper in English; the <b><i>Manila <strong>Tribu</strong>ne</i></b>, 1926; and <b><i>Graphic</i></b>, 1927. Three magazines in the 1930s were devoted solely to literary works: <b><i>Expression</i></b>, 1934; <b><i>Story Manuscripts</i></b>, 1935; and <b><i>Veronica</i></b>, 1937. The <b><i>Graphic</i></b><i> </i>has survived up to the present and continues to publish literary works and sponsor literary contests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b><i>Philippine Magazine</i></b> started by publishing syndicated press material from the United States, but by the 1930s it became the outlet for many significant Filipino works in English. Edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5369\">A. V. H. Hartendorp</a> from 1925 to 1941, the magazine published short stories by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5344\">N. V. M. Gonzalez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5686\">Bienvenido Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5727\">Edilberto Tiempo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5061\">Manuel Arguilla</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5209\">Amador T. Daguio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a>, and others. The magazine also published in several installments <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Definitions of Poetry,&rdquo; as well as his poems; essays on literary theory and criticism, music, dance, architecture, and visual arts by Hartendorp, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5491\">Ignacio Manlapaz</a>, D.

Otley Beyer; folktales, legends, and myths collected by Dean S. Fansler; a monthly humor column, Halo-Halo, written by T. Inglis Moore; and Four o&rsquo;Clock in the Editor&rsquo;s Office, a column that featured informal essays on discussions held by writers, artists, readers, and intellectuals who would meet for tea at 4:00 p.m. in Hartendorp&rsquo;s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the first student publications in English were the <b><i>College Folio</i></b>, initially issued in 1910, <b><i>Philippine Collegian</i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5456\"><b><i>Literary Apprentice</i></b></a><i> </i>of the University of the Philippines (UP); <b><i>The Coconut</i></b>, 1912, of the Manila High School; and <b><i>The Torch</i></b>, 1913, of the Philippine Normal School. Other student publications that also became good training ground for writers were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5677\"><b><i>Sands</i> <i>and Coral</i></b></a> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a>; <b><i>Quill</i> </b>and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5758\"><b><i>Varsitarian Quarterly</i></b></a>, University of Santo Tomas (UST); <b><i>Ateneo Quarterly</i></b>, Ateneo de Manila University; <b><i>Advocate</i> </b>and <b><i>Crossroads</i></b>, Far Eastern University; <b><i>UE Expression</i></b> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3957\"><b><i>Dawn</i></b></a>, University of the East; <b><i>Orion</i></b>, St. Theresa&rsquo;s College; <b><i>National</i></b>, National University; and <b><i>Clay</i></b>, University of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During World War II, nearly all the periodicals were shut down or sequestered, and new Japanese-sponsored or Japanese-directed publications appeared, such as <b><i>Pillars</i></b>, <b><i>Shin Seiki&ndash;Bagong Araw&ndash;New Day</i></b>, <b><i>Filipina</i></b>, and <b><i>Philippine Review</i></b>. The Japanese government discouraged the use of English and instituted Tagalog as the national language. In Jun 1942, <b><i>Liwayway</i></b><i> </i>was allowed to reopen and soon resumed its position as the leading publication nationwide. The periodicals of the period published essays, poems, short stories, and serialized novels. Some guerrilla newspapers were published underground. Among them were <b><i>Matang Lawin</i></b>, <b><i>Liberator</i></b>, <b><i>Ing Masala</i></b>, and <b><i>Ang Tigbatas</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_8\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Immediately after the war, <b><i>Aliwan</i></b> appeared and served as a new and important outlet for Tagalog fiction. Launched in Jul 1945, <b><i>Aliwan</i></b> was a periodical that was published in book form. Each issue was dedicated to a complete short novel. The publication changed its format in Jan 1946 and began carrying serialized novels and short stories. It was published by Palimbagang Tagumpay, which was partly owned by Ramon Roces, the publisher of <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>. It lasted until 1947. Other Tagalog magazines were produced during the early post-World War II period, such as <b><i>Bulaklak</i></b>, <b><i>Ilang-Ilang</i></b>, <b><i><strong>Malaya</strong></i></b>, <b><i>Sinag-Tala</i></b>, all launched in 1945, and <b><i>Bituin</i></b>, <b><i>Silahis</i></b>, and <b><i>Paraluman</i></b>, 1946. They also published novels in serial form and short stories.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_7\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the effects of the war on Philippine literature was the introduction of a new medium: the comic book, known locally as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><b>komiks</b></a>. The first Philippine comic book was <b><i>Halakhak <strong>Komiks</strong></i></b>, published in Manila late in 1946 by Jaime Lucas. It was patterned after the comic books brought in by the American soldiers during World War II. <b><i>Halakhak</i></b> featured comic strips, illustrated fiction, illustrated series on Filipino history and folklore, crossword puzzles, song lyrics with illustrations, Filipino riddles and proverbs, as well as editorials and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\">editorial cartoons</a> on the sociopolitical issues of the day. It ran for only 10 issues, but its influence lasted a long time. It broke the ground for the komiks, which would be a phenomenally popular and commercially successful form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1947, Roces established Ace Publications, a firm dedicated to comic book publishing. The company launched <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b><i> </i>that year, followed by <b><i>Tagalog Klasiks</i></b> in 1949, <b><i>Hiwaga Komiks</i></b> in 1950, and <b><i>Espesyal Komiks</i></b> in 1952. All titles were published in Tagalog and issued fortnightly. <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b> was the most popular, with its initial print run of 10,000 copies per issue in 1947 growing to 120,000 copies in 1961.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Following the lead of Ace Publications, many other comic book firms were established. Some were set up by magazine or textbook publishers, others by printing presses, and a few by komiks writers and artists themselves. Roces, too, formed other companies to produce more titles. So popular were the komiks that the writers and illustrators of the fiction they featured became household names. Among them were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a>, Danny Velasquez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3477\">Francisco V. Coching</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5339\">Pablo S. Gomez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\">Mars Ravelo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4312\">Carlo J. Caparas</a>. Many komiks characters also became icons in Philippine popular culture, such as Tony Velasquez&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\">Kenkoy</a>, Danny Velasquez&rsquo;s Trese, Ravelo&rsquo;s Darna, and Caparas&rsquo;s Panday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the early 1970s, there were around 80 komiks titles circulating in the market. The declaration of martial law on 21 Sep 1972 ceased the operations of the komiks industry. Publishing resumed eventually, with only the larger firms reopening and surviving. By 1986, 47 komiks titles were in circulation. Nearly all the publications appeared weekly; the most popular ones came out twice a week. Komiks continued to be produced up to the early years of the 21st century, but their quality and quantity have been in steady decline since the mid-1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meant for mass audiences, the literatures in local languages that the magazines and komiks published were popular and, to a certain degree, commercial. The more serious works of prose and poetry appeared in journals published by literary groups and institutions. In 1982, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5588\">Philippine Literary Arts Council</a> began publishing <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5157\"><strong>Caracoa</strong></a></i></b>, which featured poetry in English. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5750\">Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas</a> launched <b><i>Mithi</i></b> in 1985; the journal produced around 20 issues. In 1987, the first issue of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5044\">Ani</a> </i></b>appeared, published by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2435\"> (CCP)</a>. The 37th issue of <b><i>Ani</i>,</b> commemorating its silver anniversary, was published in 2012; it featured poetry and prose in English, Filipino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a>, Bikol, Chabacano, Ilocano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kakanaey</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>. In 2007, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5450\">UP Institute of Creative Writing launched</a> <b><i>Likhaan: The Journal of Contemporary Philippine Literature</i></b>, which features works in Filipino and English. The ninth edition of <b><i>Likhaan</i></b> was issued in 2015. The Artista at Manunulat ng Sambayanan (Armas) of the National Democratic Front (NDF) also publishes its journal of literature, <b><i>Ulos</i></b>, founded in 1972 and still active at present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"bookform\" name=\"bookform\"></a>Literary Publishing in Book Form </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Since the early 20th century, the publishing of literary books in the Philippines has been undertaken by</span><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\"> writers, writers&rsquo; groups, printing and publishing firms, periodical-publishing companies, bookstores, and cultural, educational, and governmental institutions. Although periodicals were the more significant outlet of literature during the 20th century, the publishing of literary books flourished, particularly during the last decades of the period.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the early decades of the 20th century, old literary forms continued to be published. Nineteenth-century versions of the pasyon, lives of the saints, and metrical romances were reissued and saw steady reprinting. Such texts were staples of new private enterprises such as that of Juan Martinez and of Praxedes Sayo Soriano, who were successful bookseller-publishers in Manila at that time. Martinez and Soriano also published novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In 1905, the first Tagalog novel in book form appeared: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1779\"><b><i>Ang Kasaysayan ng Magkaibigang si Nena at si Neneng</i></b></a><i> </i>(The Story of the Friends Nena and Neneng) by Valeriano Hernandez Pe&ntilde;a, printed by Tipo-Litografia Germania in Manila and likely published by the author himself. Most Tagalog novels of the 20th century followed the course of Hernandez&rsquo;s text, serialized initially in periodicals and then issued subsequently in complete arrangement as books. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_10\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Books of new Tagalog poetry began to be published, too, although they appeared much less frequently than books of fiction. Among the earliest publications of Tagalog poetry was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1920\">Ang Pangginggera: Tulang Handog sa Kababaihang Tagalog</a></i></b><i>&nbsp;</i>(The Panggingge Card Player: Poem Dedicated to Tagalog Women) by Lope K. Santos, printed by Juan Fajardo in Manila in 1912.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Works in English started to be published in book form in the early 1920s, led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5312\">Zoilo M. Galang</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1722\"><strong>A Child of Sorrow</strong></a></i></b>, the first Filipino novel in English, published in 1921 by Galang himself. The other pioneering publications in English that followed were <b><i>&ldquo;Never Mind&rdquo; and Other <strong>Poems</strong> </i></b>by Procopio L. Solidum, initially published in Iloilo, ca. 1922, then in Manila in the same year; <b><i>Daughters for Sale and Other Plays</i></b>, 1924,<i> </i>by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\">Carlos P. Romulo</a>; <b><i>Tales of the Philippines</i></b>, 1923,<i> </i>by Galang; <b><i>Filipino Poetry</i></b>, 1924, edited by Rodolfo Dato; <b><i>Filipino Love Stories</i></b>, 1927, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5500\">Paz Marquez-Benitez</a>; <b><i>Philippine</i></b><i> <b>Prose and Poetry</b></i>, 1927, published by the Bureau of Education for use in high schools, thus marking the beginning of the teaching of Philippine literature in English; and <b><i>Philippine Plays</i></b>, 1930, edited by Sol Gwekoh.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_9\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Writers&rsquo; groups played a significant role in the development of the publishing of literary books, as it was common practice among them to publish the works of their members. In the 1910s, the Tagalog writers&rsquo; groups <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5016\">Aklatang Bayan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5389\">Ilaw at Panitik</a> published novels. The Philippine Book Guild, formed in 1936, published books of poetry and prose in English, among them Arturo Rotor&rsquo;s <b><i>The Wound and The Scar</i></b>, 1937; Jose Garcia Villa&rsquo;s <b><i>Many Voices</i></b>, 1939; and Manuel Arguilla&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2020\"><b><i>How My Brother Leon Brought Home a Wife</i></b></a>, 1940. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5590\">Philippine Writers&nbsp;League</a>, established in 1939, published writings in English and reprints of Tagalog literary classics, such as Balagtas&rsquo;s <b><i>Florante at Laura</i></b>, issued in 1941. Group publishing continues to be practiced today, as in the case of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5379\">High Chair</a> group of poets, founded in 2002, which publishes their own and other poets&rsquo; works in a chapbook series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary book publishing in the decades following World War II saw a steady growth, only to be curbed by martial law under the Marcos dictatorship, and then surged after the EDSA Revolt of 1986. In 1954, Alberto Benipayo, who operated the Benipayo Press and Photo-Engraving Company, launched the Philippine Contemporary Writers series with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2001\"><b><i>Children of the Ash-Covered <strong>Loa</strong>m and Other Stories</i></b></a>, a collection of short stories by N. V. M. Gonzalez. Under the series, Benipayo published around 11 books, which were novels, short story collections, and a poetry anthology by some of the day&rsquo;s leading writers in English. The series lasted until the late 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some writers who began as self-publishers became independent literary publishers. Among them were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5194\">Andres Cristobal Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2943\">Alberto S. Florentino</a>, Rolando A. Carbonell, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5405\">F. Sionil Jose</a>. Andres Cristobal Cruz, who was a staff member of <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>, was behind the Filipino Signatures book series of the 1960s. <b><i>Estero Poems, Songs to My Beloved, and Other Songs: Sea Poems,</i></b><i> <b>6 Clarius Poems </b></i>is the title of its first publication, which is a collection of his own verse. He published around 17 books under the series, mainly poetry in English and Tagalog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alberto S. Florentino was a playwright who issued his own collection of one-act plays, <b><i>The World Is an Apple and Other Prize Plays</i></b>,<i> </i>1959. In 1962, he launched the Peso Books series, with Jose Garcia Villa&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1933\"><strong>Poems 55</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>as the first title. Around 20 other books of short stories, poems, and essays in English appeared under the series. In 1973, Florentino published two other series: Makata, which featured the poetry of honored writers such as Balagtas, Rizal, Villa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus,</a> Amador Daguio, Luis Dato, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5138\">Carlos Bulosan</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5799\">R. Zulueta da Costa</a>; and Storymasters, featuring the short stories of Paz Marquez-Benitez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5441\">Paz Latorena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5569\">Loreto Paras-Sulit</a>, Amador Daguio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5368\">Sinai Hamada</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\">A. E. Litiatco</a>, Arturo Rotor, and Francisco Arcellana. Florentino published around a hundred books by various authors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rolando A. Carbonell published his collection of poetry and prose, <b><i>Beyond Forgetting</i></b>, 1961, under the Horizons Book House imprint. It was a successful effort, with more than 20,000 copies sold in several reprints. He published other books of poetry by other authors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">F. Sionil Jose established the Solidaridad bookshop and publishing house in 1965. He published the magazine <b><i>Solidarity</i></b><i> </i>and literary books, mainly his own novels. In the mid-1980s, he began to produce a series of translations of Southeast Asian novels by such authors as Pramoedya Ananta Toer and Mochtar Lubis. The translations were in Filipino; 19 books were published under the series. To this day, Jose maintains his bookshop and publishing activities, as well as his writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Writers&rsquo; groups continued to be active in book publishing, with some producing anthologies containing the works of their members. The poetry group <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5314\">Galian sa Arte at Tula</a> or GAT, formed in 1973, has produced </span><b><i><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Gatilyo</span></i></b><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\"> (Trigger) and the Galian series. Another organization of poets, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5454\">Linangan sa Imahen, Retorika, at Anyo</a> or LIRA, 1985, has published <b><i>Unang Bagting</i></b> (First Chord), 1988; <b><i>Parikala</i> </b>(Irony), 1990; and <b><i>Ikatlong Bagting</i> </b>(Third Chord), 2003. Its latest anthology, <b><i>LIRA 30: Tatlong Dekada ng Makatang LIRA</i></b>, was released in 2015. Katha, a group of fictionists writing in Filipino, 1987, has issued five anthologies so far: <b><i>Engkwentro: Kalipunan ng mga Akda ng mga Kabataang Manunulat</i></b> (Encounter: Anthology of Works by Young Writers), 1989; <b><i>Habilin</i></b> (Message before Leaving) and <b><i>Impetu</i></b> (Impetus), 1991; <b><i>Alagwa</i></b> (Surge), 1997; <b><i><strong>Relasyon</strong></i></b> (Relationships), 1999; and <b><i>Kuwentong Siyudad</i></b><i> </i>(City Stories), 2002. The Women Writers in Media Now or WOMEN published the pioneering anthologies of women&rsquo;s literature <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1604\"><b><i>Filipina 1</i></b></a>, 1984, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1604\"><b><i>Filipina 2</i></b></a>, 1985. Underground novels like <b><i>Sebyo</i></b>, by Carlos Humberto (pseud.), 1990, and <b><i>Si Tatang sa Tungki ng Ilong ng Kaaway</i></b> (Tatang on the Tip of the Enemy&rsquo;s Nose), 1991, were published by the National Democratic Front&rsquo;s cultural arm called Linang, or Kilusan sa Paglilinang ng Rebolusyonaryong Panitikan at Sining sa Kanayunan. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">University presses have contributed to literary book publishing. The University of the Philippines Press, founded in 1965, and the Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1972, publish books of classic and new fiction, poetry, and drama. The De La Salle University (DLSU) Press, 1983, now De La Salle University Publishing House, issued a few literary titles in the 1980s and 1990s, but its literary interests now are focused on criticism and theory. The UST Publishing House, since its establishment in 1996, has become an active producer of books of contemporary literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In 1986, the presses of ADMU, DLSU, and UP entered into a consortium for a six-year project called the Panitikan series, which aimed to reissue some out-of-print, local classics and to make accessible the little-known but significant literatures of some 12 non-Tagalog ethnolinguistic groups through Filipino and English translations. Among the titles in this series were Rogelio Sikat&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1730\"><strong>Dugo sa Bukang-Liwayway</strong></a></i></b> (Blood at Daybreak), originally published in 1965, and Faustino Aguilar&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1789\"><strong>Pinaglahuan</strong></a></i></b> (Eclipsed), 1907. The translation series included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5163\">Casabar Constante</a>&#39;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1724\"><strong>Dagiti Mariing iti Parbangon</strong></a></i></b> (They Who Awaken at Dawn), originally serialized in <b><i>Bannawag</i></b> in 1956-57, and translated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5269\">Reynaldo Duque</a> as <b><i>Silang Nagigising sa Madaling Araw</i></b>, 1993;<i> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2036\">Marcel M.

The popularity of the books led to the establishment of many companies dedicated to publishing such novels and to other publishers producing their own romance series. The most prominent and successful of them is Precious Pages Corporation, founded in 1992, which is the most prolific Tagalog romance novel publisher today.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary books have also been produced by the leading trade publishers. New Day Publishers, established in the 1970s, publishes fiction, drama, essays, and traditional literature. Kalikasan Press, begun in the mid-1980s and now defunct, published poetry, fiction, drama, and essays. Anvil Publishing, 1990, published new writings under their Contemporary Poetry and Contemporary Fiction series, as well as, briefly, popular romance novels and crime fiction series. Anvil has scaled back on their literary titles and currently publishes select authors only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Children&rsquo;s book publishing in the Philippines began in the 1980s and has grown to be a vibrant sector in the book industry today. Firms such as the pioneering Adarna House, established in 1980, Tahanan Books, 1991, and Lampara Books, 1997, publish traditional stories and songs, and new writings for children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some bookstores ventured into publishing, such as National Book Store, Bookmark, Goodwill Bookstore, Alemar-Phoenix Publishing House, and Popular Bookstore. Although the publishing activities of these enterprises mainly involved textbooks, they did issue literary works occasionally. Alemar-Phoenix published <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5400\">Stevan Javellana</a>&rsquo;s novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1829\"><strong>Without Seeing the Dawn</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>in 1976. Among National Book Store&rsquo;s publications was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s novel <b><i>Cave and Shadows</i></b>, 1983. In the 1990s, Bookmark published new editions of the works of Joaquin, Francisco Arcellana, and N. V. M. Gonzalez, and new translations of Rizal&rsquo;s novels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary contests, which serve to generate literary production, also provide material for publication. Winning entries of literary contests, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\">Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a>, the Gawad CCP sa Panitikan, and the Gawad Collantes of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5426\">Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino</a>, are published by the sponsoring institutions. The winning entries of the Centennial Literary Prize of 1998, which was held in commemoration of the independence of the Philippines, were published by the UP Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"digitalform\" name=\"digitalform\"></a>Literary Publishing in Digital Form</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine literature has an active presence on the Internet through the websites established and managed by authors, scholars, students, and various institutions of culture, education, and literature. Panitikan.ph, a joint project of the Likhaan Foundation, the UP Institute of Creative Writing, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, features new prose and poetry. High Chair publishes an online journal of poetry, launched in 2002 and now on its 19th issue. The electronic scholarly journal <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i></b><i> </i>of the ADMU English Department has a literary section, which carries new fiction and poetry. There are also many blogs that publish Philippine literature, including regional writings. Some sites reproduce traditional and classic works; others feature new, original material.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_11\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_12\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The websites of periodicals that publish literature also maintain the presence of Philippine literature online. The <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i> </b>operates an online site featuring selected materials from their archive, while the <b><i>Philippines Graphic</i></b> offers online versions of their magazine issues. Armas of the NDF has versions of its journal <b><i>Ulos</i></b> available online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The publishing of electronic books is still at an early, tentative stage as of mid-2014. Among the publishers of literary books, only the UP Press has begun to issue e-book versions of its titles and only a small selection of literary works. Many old works of Philippine literature, however, such as early Tagalog novels and poems, have been made available for free in electronic-format digital libraries, such as Project Gutenberg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"scholarship\" name=\"scholarship\"></a>The Publishing of Literary Scholarship </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Literary scholarship is generally published by university presses, research centers, and institutes, all of which put out books, journals, monographs, and occasional papers. Most of these organizations are attached to institutions of higher learning and are usually managed by faculty and research staff. While the majority of publishing and publishing-related organizations are in Metro Manila, some scholarly publishers that are in other regions are the Cordillera Studies Center, the De La Salle Bacolod Research Center, the University of San Carlos publication office and its Cebuano Studies Center, and the Mindanao State University publication office. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Books on Philippine literary criticism and literary history have been published mainly by the presses of UP, ADMU, and DLSU. St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College, through the Babaylan Publishing Collective of its Institute of Women&rsquo;s Studies, has published some books on feminist literature and criticism. Anvil Publishing, although a trade publisher, has issued a few titles of local literary scholarship and manuals on the teaching of Philippine literature. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">There are a few academic journals dedicated to literary studies, such as <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i></b><i> </i>of the ADMU English Department and the <b><i>Journal of English and Comparative Literature</i></b><i> </i>of the Department of English and Comparative Literature of UP Diliman. Articles on Philippine literary criticism and literary history have also occasionally appeared in the journals <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b><i> </i>of the ADMU, <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b><i> </i>of UP Diliman, and <b><i><strong>Bulawan</strong></i></b><i> </i>of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts. </span><span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"> </span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5094\"><strong>Joi Barrios</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2755\"><strong>Glecy Atienza</strong></a>, and Carol Afan</strong> </em><em><strong>updated by Patricia May Jurilla, with notes from Esther Pacheco, Rosario Cruz-Lucero, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5459\"><strong>Ma.

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Organizations</b> are groups of writers who come together for a variety of purposes. Writers may organize themselves because of a common worldview, political ideology, or intellectual temperament. Others form groups for publication and workshop projects. Writers have also been known to get together for the sake of literary fellowship and sharing of artistic output, with some ritualistic elements involved. Groups outside of Manila have strengthened their ranks so that they may continue to assert regional writing and identity, in the process contributing to the development of a multiethnic body of national literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A listing of the history of writers&rsquo; groups is essential for two reasons. One, it gives a picture of how writers&rsquo; groups have influenced literary trends and movements. Second, it shows how writers may have influenced one another&rsquo;s works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The origins of literary organizing in the Philippines can be traced back to the reform movement, 1882-96. The prime movers of the reform movement based in Spain chose to publish critical, often satirical, essays about the Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. These writers, among them <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>, used the newspaper <b><i>La Solidaridad</i></b> as the venue for their campaign for reforms. While it is debatable that these propagandists organized themselves formally as a &ldquo;literary group,&rdquo; one cannot deny that these writers were bound by a common desire to work for a political cause through their writings.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The oldest literary society in the country could be the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5449\">Liceo-Artistico Literario</a>, established in 1879 to promote Spanish letters in the Philippines and to establish &ldquo;professional chairs of literature, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a>, music and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>.&rdquo; Emiliano Olano became the president of this organization, which lasted for only three years but which succeeded in launching two projects. One was the publication of a weekly (later, fortnightly) magazine, <b><i>Revista del Liceo Artistico-Literario</i></b>, 1879. It came out with six issues. The editor in chief, Francisco de Marcaida, a Filipino, had a staff of 21 Spaniards and three Filipinos, many of them award-winning prose writers and poets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other project was a literary contest. Two contests were held by the Liceo: one in 1879 and another in 1880, to commemorate the 264th death anniversary of Miguel de Cervantes. Jose Rizal&rsquo;s entries won in both contests: <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1832\">&ldquo;A la Juventud Filipina&rdquo;</a> (To the Filipino Youth) in 1879 and &ldquo;El Consejo de los Dioses&rdquo; (The Council of the Gods) in 1880.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The core activity of literary groups active during the last decade of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century was the <i>tertulia</i>, or a gathering of artists, lovers of art and culture, and friends who discuss a variety of topics. These gatherings provided venues for the study of works of other writers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> readings, literary discussions, and debates on the political issues of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <i>tertulia</i> sponsored by the Academia de la Lengua y Literatura, founded in 1892 at the residence of Vicente Ilustre by Macario Adriatico, attracted the best writers of the period. Among its 50 members, then university students, were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5348\">Fernando Ma. Guerrero</a>, Gregorio Aguilera, Luis Luna, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5051\">Cecilio Apostol</a>. By 1894, the organization was holding its gatherings at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5238\">Epifanio de los Santos</a>&rsquo;s residence in Intramuros. New members were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5557\">Rafael Palma</a>, Clemente Jose Zulueta, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5350\">Manuel Guerrero</a>. Others who were reported to have joined the literary tertulias of the Academia were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5393\">Emilio Jacinto</a> and Juan Sumulong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another literary club of the period was El Jardin de Epicuro, founded by Fernando Ma. Guerrero. The members of this group were modernist writers like Sixto Roces, Feliciano Basa, Jose R. Teotico, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5797\">Flavio Cano Zaragoza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5754\">Alejo Valdez Pica</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5373\">Jose Gavira Hernandez</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5083\">Jesus Balmori</a>. This group discussed, among other things, the works of Ruben Dario, a Spanish writer who greatly influenced their works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tertulias of Liceo, the Academia, El Jardin, and other groups attracted the participation of Tagalog writers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5630\">I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tagalog writers started to form groups during the first decade of American colonial rule. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5016\">Aklatang Bayan</a> was formed in 1910 in Tondo, Manila, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5032\">Rosauro Almario</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5172\">Gerardo Chanco</a> elected president and secretary, respectively. The Aklatang Bayan&rsquo;s objectives, published in the newspaper <b><i>Renacimiento Filipino</i></b>, included fighting &ldquo;bad&rdquo; habits and beliefs in politics, religion, and everyday life (Almario 1984, 54).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the activities sponsored by the Aklatang Bayan were weekly meetings that featured poetic orations and songs. The group also sponsored contests and propagated the national language. The Aklatang Bayan celebrated Balagtas Day, 2 Apr, by staging literary jousts in several towns in Bulacan: Baliuag, 1915; Meycauayan, 1916; and Bigaa (now Balagtas), 1917. Aklatang Bayan drew its strength from the popularity of its members, many of whom were the leading writers of the period whose activities were featured in the dailies. Active in the group were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K.

Organized during the early 20th century, the group was headed for a long time by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5198\">Jose Esperanza Cruz</a>. It was one of the biggest and most popular of the literary societies, and had among its members the likes of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> short story pioneer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5662\">Deogracias A.

Jose Esperanza Cruz, editor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\"><b><i>Liwayway</i></b></a> for more than 20 years, became the first president of Ilaw at Panitik.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Aug 1915, Cirio H. Panganiban explained that &ldquo;Ilaw,&rdquo; or light, referred to the belief and confidence of the writer, whereas &ldquo;Panitik,&rdquo; or pen, referred to a literature committed to the independence of the country. Other literary organizations active during the first decade were Samahang Mananagalog, Kapisanang Sisne, Dunong Ginto, Florante at Laura, Aklatang Barusaga, all of which were in Tondo, and Aklatang Balagtas in Sampaloc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1935, at the residence of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/4999\">Alejandro G. Abadilla</a> in Santa Cruz, Manila, the young writers of Tagalog literature formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5420\">Kapisanang Panitikan</a>. The group was a reaction to the older Aklatang Bayan and Ilaw at Panitik, whose members were being published in major outlets like <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a statement, the members of the Kapisanang Panitikan described their group as &ldquo;<i>sakdalista </i>at <i>aristokrata</i>,&rdquo; because like the radical peasant group also called Sakdalista, it rejected the reigning aesthetic in Tagalog literature and it was ready to be alienated from the mainstream (Almario 1984, 134). This group, led by Abadilla, founding vice president, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5249\">Clodualdo del Mundo</a>, founding president, &ldquo;was determined to be &lsquo;modern,&rsquo; in the sense that it was to diverge from the traditional along lines being pursued by the writers of Philippine English literature&rdquo; (Lumbera and Lumbera 1982, 112). Among the members of Panitikan were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5007\">Teodoro Agoncillo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5102\">Brigido Batungbakal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5095\">Salvador Barros</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5503\">Epifanio Gar.

Many of what they burned were the works by the older writers. The book burning was a symbolic event which showed the rift between the older writers and the members of Panitikan. In 1938, Panitikan managed to put out a magazine also called <b><i>Panitikan</i></b>. The organization endured for decades and lasted until the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1920s, a group of students of the University of the Philippines (UP) formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5752\">UP Writers&rsquo; Club</a>, &ldquo;impelled by a noble aim to elevate to the highest pedestal of possible perfection the ENGLISH language in the Islands.&rdquo; The group&rsquo;s original motto was &ldquo;ART shall not be a Means to an End but AN END IN ITSELF&rdquo; (Abad and Manlapaz 1989, 253).

The quality of the works published in the literary magazine was such as to make the editors of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5589\"><b><i>Philippine Magazine</i></b></a> and of the <b><i>Philippine Prose and <strong>Poetry</strong></i></b> textbooks reprint works first published in the <b><i>Apprentice</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At around the time that Kapisanang Panitikan was founded, some Filipino writers using English also formed a radical group. Calling themselves the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5764\">Veronicans</a>, their &ldquo;bold&rdquo; stories were rejected for publications by magazines (Serrano 2009, 81). They published their works in three magazines that they themselves started: <b><i>Expression</i></b>,<b> </b>1934, <b><i>Story Manuscripts</i></b>,<b> </b>1935,<b> </b>which was mimeographed, and <b><i>Veronica</i></b>, 1935-36, all short-lived (Abad and Manlapaz 1989, 257-58).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the writers identified as Veronicans were Francisco Arcellana, Lydia Villanueva-Arguilla, Manuel Arguilla, Ernesto Basa, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5223\">Angel de Jesus</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5245\">Oscar de Zu&ntilde;iga</a>, Lazaro Espinosa, Salvador Faustino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5296\">Lina Flor</a>, Antonio S. Gabila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5344\">N. V. M. Gonzalez</a>, Armando J. Malay, Hernando Ocampo, Pacita Pesta&ntilde;o, and Manuel Viray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1930s and early 1940s, some of the bilingual writers were members of both Panitikan and Veronicans. It was their involvement in the literary movement toward modernism that encouraged these writers to band together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Probably the first women&rsquo;s literary group was the Bachelorettes. They associated with the Veronicans in teas and literary gatherings (Ordo&ntilde;ez 1986, 2). Teresa Arzaga, Luisa Barrera, Nelly Xerez-Burgos, Corazon Juliano, Trinidad Tarrosa-Subido, Sally Barrera, Olivia Calumpang, and Carmen Perez were the eight original Bachelorettes. Both the Veronicans and Panitikan members &ldquo;saw themselves as literary rebels and <i>avant-garde </i>artists&rdquo; (Lumbera and Lumbera 1982, 112).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1939, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5590\">Philippine Writers&nbsp;League</a> was formed. Considered to be the first national writers&rsquo; group with a social orientation, it believed that literature must have &ldquo;social content.&rdquo; The League&rsquo;s officers were the following: Federico Mangahas, president; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5462\">Salvador P. Lopez</a>, vice president; Jose A. Lansang, vice president; I. P. Caballero, vice president; and R. R. Roces Jr, treasurer. The formation of the league was a crystallization of the debate already begun some years earlier, and which continued after World War II, on the function of literature. On one side were Lopez and Arturo Rotor; on the other, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5457\">A. E. Litiatco</a> and Francisco Arcellana. The league followed the &ldquo;alternative critical orientation&rdquo; offered by Salvador P. Lopez in his essays, eventually published as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1623\"><b><i>Literature and Society</i></b></a>, 1940. Lopez pointed out the &ldquo;vacuousness&rdquo; of Villa&rsquo;s aestheticism (Lumbera and Lumbera 1982, 116). In 1940, the Philippine Writers&rsquo; League sponsored the Commonwealth Literary Contests to promote socially conscious literature and accordingly rewarded entries that were such, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5799\">Rafael Zulueta da Costa</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1894\">&ldquo;Like the Molave.&rdquo;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Kalipunan ng mga Manunulat sa Wikang Pilipino (Kawika) was organized immediately after the Japanese-sponsored republic was proclaimed. At around this time, Tagalog was proclaimed as a national language, a development that had a significant impact on literature. The members of Kawika attended classes conducted by Lope K. Santos, who was then head of the Institute of National Language. Among those who enrolled were Francisco Arcellana, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3488\">Emilio Aguilar Cruz</a>, Amadeo Dacanay, Lina Flor-Trinidad, N. V. M. Gonzalez, Paz Latorena, Juan C. Laya, Salvador Lopez, Maria Luna Lopez, Hernando Ocampo, and Lydia Villanueva-Arguilla. Little else is known about Kawika except that some members who were at that time primarily writing in English shifted to Tagalog. N. V. M. Gonzalez won an award for a short story published in <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>. H. R. Ocampo, who would later on be known as a painter, also produced fiction and poetry in Tagalog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No other writers&rsquo; organization seemed to be active during the Japanese occupation. A few literary pieces were published in the <b><i>Sunday Magazine</i></b>; <b><i>Philippine Review</i></b>; <b><i>Pillars</i></b>, published by the Philippine Cultural Institute; <b><i>Bagong Araw</i></b>,<i> <b>Filipina</b></i>, and <b><i>Liwayway</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, the Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon or Hukbalahap, the main anti-Japanese resistance group in Central Luzon, had a cultural bureau that produced plays. Revolutionary songs and poetry were also produced by the guerrillas. Anonymous writers produced propaganda literature, but they did not form literary groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the war, the Philippine literary scene suffered from a lack of literary outlets. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5007\">Teodoro Agoncillo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Malaya</strong></i></b>, founded in 1945, folded up after a brief period (Almario 1984, 153-54). Moreover, the commercial magazines did not seem to encourage writings that were not popular with the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was in this context that the postwar writers produced their works. Manuel Viray, still reacting to the politics of the Philippine Writers&rsquo; League, organized the Filipino Writers&rsquo; Guild. The guild had the following objectives: advancement of the economic interests of the writer, publication of the books of its members, and cooperation with workers in allied trades and with the cause of unionism in the country. Viray thought that the guild should adopt simply the &ldquo;spectatorial attitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;should be careful of writing which makes of doctrine the motive and end of writing&rdquo; (Ordo&ntilde;ez 1986, 3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two other writers&rsquo; groups were active in the 1950s, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5624\">Ravens</a> among the writers in English and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5419\">Kapisanang Aklat, Diwa at Panitik</a> (Kadipan) among Tagalog writers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Founded in 1951, the Ravens was an offshoot of the UP Writers&rsquo; Club. Among its original members were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5053\">Pacifico Aprieto</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5304\">Hilario Francia</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5278\">S.

Most of them at that time were writing for either the <b><i>Philippine Collegian</i></b>, the official newspaper of the UP, or the <b><i>Philippinensian</i></b>, the UP yearbook. They were later joined by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5192\">Adrian Cristobal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5256\">Morli Dharam</a>, Nick Nicolas, Romy Chua, Danny Villanueva, and E. P.

Members of the Ravens, however, claim no other cause but that they liked the sound of the word. The Ravens had as mentor N. V. M. Gonzalez, who conducted informal workshops at his residence as well as at that of Virginia Moreno on Juan Luna St, Tondo. The group also held poetry readings. The Ravens were influential in the 1950s because they occupied key positions in publications like the <b><i>Literary Apprentice</i></b>, the <b><i>Philippine Collegian</i></b>, and the<i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5261\"><b>Diliman Review</b></a></i>.<i> </i>The Ravens continued to be active in the 1980s and the 1990s. In Nov 1975, they sponsored an International Poetry Festival, which was well attended by writers. The group published three anthologies of their works: <b><i>The Ravens</i></b>, 1980; <b><i>The Ravens 2</i></b>, 1996; and <b><i>Ravens in Love</i></b>, 2002.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At least two members became leading figures in the largest and most influential writers&rsquo; groups in the country. Adrian Cristobal was chairperson of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5750\">Unyon ng mga Manunulat ng Pilipinas</a>&nbsp;in the 1970s and 1980s. Elmer Ordo&ntilde;ez was elected founding chairperson of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5558\">Pambansang Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas (Panulat)</a> in 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Founded on 22 Oct 1950 at the Manuel L. Quezon Educational Institution (later University) in Quiapo, Manila, Kadipan had as its members aggressive, idealistic, and socially aware young writers from various colleges and universities in Manila. The organization&rsquo;s objectives were to promote the Pilipino language, to generate a vigorous Philippine literature, and to expand the space allotted to the national language in campus papers. Because of its commitment to the development of the national language, the group had the support of the Pilipino departments of member schools as well as the Institute of National Language (Almario 1984, 198).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among its first members were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5597\">Ponciano Pineda</a> (who later became the director of the Institute of National Language), Tomas C. Ongoco, Hilario Coronel, Pablo Bautista, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5421\">Elpidio Kapulong</a>, Benjamin Condino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5499\">C. C. Marquez Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5620\">Bienvenido Ramos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5646\">Pedro Ricarte</a>. They were joined later by Virgilio S. Almario, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5002\">Efren Abueg</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5435\">Domingo Landicho</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5487\">Rogelio Mangahas</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5046\">Lamberto Antonio</a>. These leading literary figures, as well as other members from Manuel L. Quezon University, the University of Santo Tomas, Philippine Normal College, Far Eastern University, Philippine College of Commerce, and UP, became very active in the projects of Kadipan in the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kadipan sponsored an annual literary contest, which lasted from 1956 to 1968. Winners were chosen from the poems, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\">essays</a>, or stories published in the school papers. Another valuable output of the group was the anthology <b><i>Mga Piling Akda ng Kadipan </i></b>(Selected Works of Kadipan), 1965, in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine Center of Poets, Essayists, Novelists (PEN) International was born in the late 1950s, with Alfredo T. Morales as chairman and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5405\">F. Sionil Jose</a> as national secretary. The local chapter held its first national writers&rsquo; conference in Baguio on 26-29 Dec 1958. Among the issues discussed were the state patronage of the arts, literature and politics, nationalism, and the problems of publishing. The PEN Philippine Center endured even during the martial law period. The group has hosted foreign writers, including Wole Soyinka, Richard Kim, Lin Yutang, Khushwant Singh, Hirabayashi Taiko, Hayako Sono, Norman Mailer, Gunter Grass, and Mario Vargas Llosa. It has been sponsoring several conferences on such topics as underground literature, protest theater, Filipino as the language of national literature, and feminist writing; and it continues to publish papers and resolutions on questions of freedom of expression, including protests against the disappearance of journalists and the Maguindanao Massacre in 2009. It also holds teacher-training workshops and forums around the country. Apart from F. Sionil Jose, other writers connected with the Philippine PEN are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5541\">Charlson Ong</a>, Elmer Ordo&ntilde;ez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a>, Jose Wendell Capili, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5113\">Herminio Beltran Jr</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5640\">Jun Cruz Reyes</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_7\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the 1980s and the 1990s, prolific novelist F. Sionil Jose continued to be the prime mover behind the Philippine PEN. He has also been a moving force behind the Southeast Asian writers&rsquo; conferences participated in by young writers, mostly in their 30s. Jose is well known as owner of Solidaridad Publishing House, which puts out the quarterly journal <b><i>Solidarity</i></b>. Many members of the Philippine PEN contribute to this publication. Funded by the Ford Foundation, <b><i>Solidarity</i></b> has produced a substantial number of issues and has featured essays, poetry, fiction, and drama, as well as papers delivered during Southeast Asian writers&rsquo; conferences. The members of its editorial board are writers from Southeast Asia&mdash;among them, Mochtar Lubis, Edwin Thumboo, Sulak Sivaraska, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5197\">Isagani R. Cruz</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During martial law, several writers who were also members of the PEN became political prisoners. While they may have been imprisoned not primarily for their writings but because of their political activities, several fellow members encouraged other writers to petition for their release. This, plus the support of writers from other countries, eventually pressured the Philippine government to release them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 12 Oct 1962, a new organization, the La Solidaridad Filipino-Hispana Inc, was set up to promote the value of the Spanish language in the Philippines. Its incorporators were Dr Jose Maria Delgado y Salcedo, first Filipino ambassador to the Vatican; Dr Benjamin Barrera, dean of the UP College of Medicine; Dr Jesus M. Tan, director of the San Juan de Dios Hospital; Don Francisco Delgado, Don Antonio Delgado, and Dr Agustin Perez Lizano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At around this time, Don Manuel Cuenco succeeded in having a law passed increasing the required 12 units of Spanish in college to 24. The Cuenco Law required the reading of the patriotic writings of Filipinos in Spanish. A very active organization, the Solidaridad organized radio and TV programs; published a bimonthly magazine for Spanish teachers titled El Maestro; opened Spanish-language and dance classes; and sponsored researches in Filipino music, dance, costume, and architecture. It compiled all books published in Spanish. Lectures were delivered by its members on various topics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two groups of poets became known in the 1960s for ushering in modernism in Tagalog poetry. One of these groups was the Manlilikha, whose leading lights were Virgilio S. Almario, Lamberto Antonio, Rogelio Mangahas, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5470\">Ruth Elynia Mabanglo</a>, all based at the University of the East. The poems of the Manlilikha group were published in the pages of <b><i>Dawn</i></b>, the university&rsquo;s militant campus paper, which at that time had a weekly circulation of 65,000. It is said that even the writers of <b><i>Liwayway</i> </b>and<b> <i>Taliba</i></b> eagerly awaited the works of these poets. In 1967, they came out with the anthology <b><i>Manlilikha: Mga Piling Tula 1961-1967</i></b> (Creator: Selected Poems 1961-1967), edited by Rogelio Mangahas. This collection of new poetry was determined to prove to the literary public that modernism had arrived in Tagalog poetry (Lumbera and Lumbera 1982, 248).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5078\"><b>bagay</b></a> poets, based at Ateneo de Manila University, were highly influenced by trends in European and American philosophy and literature. The group drew on the Imagists, a school of poetry formed in the first decade of the twentieth century. The word <i>bagay</i> literally means &ldquo;thing&rdquo; or &ldquo;object.&rdquo; The implication is that the poetry of the group is built on situational imagery. Bagay poems avoided sentimental and traditionally &ldquo;poetic&rdquo; subject matter. Instead, the bagay poets used ordinary experience, like hanging around in the cafeteria, coming home from the cinema, or apartment living. If a potentially emotional situation, such as a wake or a homecoming, were the subject of a piece, the use of concrete details, sharp sensual images, and precise, informal language prevented the poem from becoming maudlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A new kind of poetic discourse followed the Manlilikha and bagay period. The writers of the late 1960s and the early 1970s became more politically involved, joining not only literary organizations but mass rallies, demonstrations, and marches&mdash;activities characterizing the nationalist movement for social change known as the First Quarter Storm. Thus did poetry take on a radical voice. In 1971, these nationalist writers formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5565\">Panulat para sa Kaunlaran ng Sambayanan</a> or PAKSA. This included some of the members of the Manlilikha and bagay group and new writers based in various colleges and universities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The nationalist and progressive writers began organizing PAKSA in Jul 1970. A group met informally on 26 Sep 1970 at the Philippine College of Commerce (now Polytechnic University of the Philippines or PUP). They agreed to form an organization in order to safeguard writers&rsquo; rights against exploitative publishers and editors. They also passed a resolution to this effect and agreed on the new organization&rsquo;s name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first official meeting was held on 23 Mar 1971 at the Philippine College of Commerce, attended by 16 writers. Elected officers of the Committee for the launching of PAKSA were Domingo Landicho as chairperson, Rogelio Sikat aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5696\">Rogelio Sicat</a> as secretary general, and Bienvenido Lumbera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5543\">Rogelio Ordo&ntilde;ez</a>, and Virgilio S. Almario as spokespersons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first activity was a demonstration on 2 Apr 1971, Balagtas Day, at Plaza Moriones, site of the book-burning activity of Panitikan in 1940. The demonstration carried the theme &ldquo;Panulat para sa Pambansang Rebolusyong Pangkultura&rdquo; (Writing for the National Cultural Revolution). Marching from Plaza Moriones to the National Library, PAKSA members were joined by members of the Kabataang Makabayan (KM), Samahang Demokratiko ng Kabataan, Samahang Molabe, Tanghalang Kamanyang, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>, the last two being activist theater groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">That same afternoon, several writers were being honored inside the National Library. Those who were members of PAKSA went out to meet the marchers and added the plaques they had just received to the pyre. This symbolized the writers&rsquo; rejection of reactionary literature (Almario 1984, 267).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">PAKSA held a national workshop for writers on 24-25 Jul and 1 Aug 1971. An official congress was held on 18-19 Dec 1971. Bienvenido Lumbera was elected chairperson. The PAKSA manifesto espoused the view that since literature is part of culture and writers are a society&rsquo;s conscience, writers must be committed to the creation of literature that speaks for the people&mdash;a mass literature that should forge the revolution against American imperialism and the installation of national democracy (Almario 1984, 268). True to its name and its acronym, meaning &ldquo;theme,&rdquo; the organization worked around the basic theme of protracted struggle in the field of culture and sought to create a literature that was purposive and oriented toward praxis, one that seeks to &ldquo;expose and oppose&rdquo; the evils of Philippine society and one whose social analyses and calls to action are carried out through its writers&rsquo; street activism and cultural work in schools and factories.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">PAKSA, however, was short-lived. It was branded by the Marcos intelligence apparatus as a front of the Communist Party of the Philippines. With the declaration of martial law, many of its members either went underground or shifted to other forms of political work, thus preventing it from developing into a full-blown national organization of writers with an open national democratic orientation in literary production and other forms of cultural work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 21 Sep 1972, martial law was declared, heightening the contradiction between the establishment and colonial culture, on the one hand, and the Filipino, mass, democratic culture, on the other (Tiongson 1984, 5). Undaunted by the atmosphere of repression, writers continued to found literary organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The concept of forming a &ldquo;union,&rdquo; which implied that, like workers, writers needed to organize to fight for their rights, was brought to focus by the establishment in 1975 of the Writers&rsquo; Union of the Philippines (WUP). It later became known as the Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas (UMPIL). It was the largest group of writers in the country in the 1970s, and continues to be a viable organization with a roster of members and institutional support.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_8\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The first president of WUP or UMPIL was Adrian Cristobal, after whom the Adrian Cristobal Memorial Lecture at the annual UMPIL national convention is named. For many years Virgilio S. Almario was acknowledged as the prime mover behind the organization. Among its most active members during the early 1980s were T. D.

Coroza</a>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The main activities of the organization are an annual literary awards, consisting of the Gawad Balagtas, given to outstanding writers in various genres, the Gawad <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5500\">Paz Marquez-Benitez</a>, given to educators, and Gawad Pedro Bucaneg, given to literary organizations; an annual national convention, often revolving around a theme; conferences for teachers; poetry readings in various universities; and until 1995, the publication of its journal, <b><i>Mithi</i></b>.<i> </i>In 2013, it began the &ldquo;UMPILan&rdquo; interview series, which explores one aspect of Philippine literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1986, several officers and members of UMPIL resigned or became inactive in the organization because of political differences with other members. Thus was born another writers&rsquo; organization describing itself as a union, the Pambansang Unyon ng mga Manunulat ng Pilipinas or Panulat. An unpublished document called the &ldquo;Filipino Writers&rsquo; Declaration of 1986&rdquo; led to the founding of the organization. According to this declaration, there was a need for a national organization of writers committed to the protection, promotion, and enhancement of the economic welfare of Filipino writers; such an organization of writers had an imperative task of defending the right to free expression; and the development and propagation of a national culture was among the tasks of writers at present. More than 300 writers signed the declaration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Panulat describes itself as being committed to the welfare of its own members. Its program of action includes initiating dialogues between writers and editors, and between writers and publishers, film producers, donors, and various patrons of the arts, whether here or abroad, to secure writing grants, more and better outlets, and improved compensation for writers. It also recognizes that the problems of writers should be related to the larger problems of Philippine society. The Panulat declaration asserts that the group would also &ldquo;support all national efforts at solving problems of underdevelopment, which are at the root of the economic difficulties writers suffer from and the general depression of opportunities in publishing and writing.&rdquo; Elected founding chairperson and secretary-general during the first congress were Elmer M. Ordo&ntilde;ez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2725\">Reuel Molina Aguila</a>, respectively. Bienvenido Lumbera and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3186\">Nonilon V. Quea&ntilde;o</a> succeeded them as chairperson and secretary-general of the organization, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Panulat sponsored a grassroots-writing workshop, a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">comics</a>-writing workshop, a concert titled <b><i>Panaghoy</i></b> (Lamentation), and a conference on arts and literature which coincided with the 20th anniversary of PAKSA. Among those who have been elected to the Panulat board of directors and secretariat are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5094\">Joi Barrios</a>, JJ dela Rosa, Tala Isla, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5429\">Jose F.

In his opening remarks at the founding congress of Panulat in 1986, Ordo&ntilde;ez said that the purpose of the group was &ldquo;to form a national writers&rsquo; union that looks after and beyond the needs of its members, committed to help the less fortunate in our society and having a stake in building a just, sovereign, and democratic country.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1980s, many groups were formed by those whose writing was focused on a particular literary genre. Among these organizations are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5454\">Linangan sa Imahen, Retorika, at Anyo</a> or LIRA, 1986, and Katha, a group of fictionists, 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_9\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">LIRA was organized in 1986 by poets who attended the Rio Alma Poetry Clinic, named after Virgilio S. Almario, whose pseudonym is Rio Alma, at the Adarna House office on Quezon Ave. Vim Nadera was elected president. Among the most active members of the group were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5090\">Romulo P. Baquiran Jr</a>, Suzette Flores, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5697\">Luna Sicat</a>, and Maningning Miclat. Mike Bigornia and Teo Antonio were advisers. The group describes itself as &ldquo;bayanihan ng mga makata&rdquo; (cooperative of poets). It has produced these anthologies of works by its members: <b><i>Unang Bagting</i></b> (First Chord), 1988; <b><i>Parikala</i></b> (Irony), 1990; <b><i>Ikatlong Bagting</i></b> (Third Chord), 2003; <b><i>Lirang Pilak</i></b> (Silver Lyre), 2010; and <b><i>LIRA 30: Tatlong Dekada ng Makatang LIRA</i></b>, 2015. Today LIRA holds its annual poetry clinic every Saturdays and Sundays for four months, often in UP Diliman. It is one of the longest-running literary training programs in the country. Almario, as workshop director emeritus, still actively oversees the sessions and gives lectures every now and then, while other senior members, like Michael Coroza, Rebecca T. A&ntilde;onuevo, Roberto T. A&ntilde;onuevo, and Baquiran, handle the regular sessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In 2008, LIRA began a nationwide outreach program called Sining ng Tugma at Sukat (later called Pambansang Edukasyong Pampanitikan) aimed at promoting literature and language through the teaching of native literary works and forms. More than 3,000 teachers and students from 300 public and private schools in more than 30 towns have participated in the program. The two-day seminar includes sessions on &ldquo;Sining ng Tugma at Sukat&rdquo; (Art of Rhyme and Meter) and &ldquo;Sining ng Talinghaga at Tayutay&rdquo; (Art of Metaphor and Figures of Speech), as well as writing workshops and special lectures. As a primarily training organization, a majority of its active members continue to be young, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5670\">Edgar Calabia Sama</a>r, Giancarlo Abrahan, Mariane A. R. T. Abuan, Louie Jon A. Sanchez, John Enrico Torralba, Beverly Siy, and Phillip Kimpo Jr.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The idea to form a group of fictionists was explored in 1989 by Rolando B. Tolentino, JJ de la Rosa, Joi Barrios, Ricky Nu&ntilde;ez, and Francine Medina. Tolentino was elected founding president of Katha. Elected as officers were De la Rosa, Barrios, Romulo P. Baquiran Jr, Honorio Bartolome de Dios, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5365\">Chit Balmaceda-Gutierrez</a>. Other members were Luna Sicat, Vim Nadera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5355\">Eli Guieb</a>, Joel Sayo, Abet Umil, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4984\">Ian Victoriano</a>, Noel Salonga, Ariel Valerio, Rolando Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4375\">Mes de Guzman</a>, and Nenet Lachica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A regular activity of Katha is its Sunday workshop, which has been held at various venues&mdash;among them, the Heritage Art Center, the residences of its members, and UP. These workshops have also served as venues for writers to interact. Among those who have given lectures for Katha are Mario Miclat, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5357\">Gelacio Guillermo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice Guillermo</a>, Romeo Dizon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>, and Jun Cruz Reyes. Fidel Rillo and Romulo Sandoval have served as advisers to the group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Six anthologies have been published by Katha. These are <b><i>Engkwentro: Kalipunan ng mga Akda ng mga Kabataang Manunulat </i></b>(Encounter: Anthology of Works by Young Writers), 1989; <b><i>Impetu</i></b> (Impetus) and <b><i>Habilin </i></b>(Message before Leaving), 1991; <b><i>Alagwa</i></b> (Breakaway), 1997; <b><i><strong>Relasyon</strong></i> </b>(Relation), 1999; and <b><i>Kuwentong Siyudad</i> </b>(City Stories), 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1988, a group of women writers formed the group Women Involved in Creating Cultural Alternatives (WICCA). Among its most active members were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5286\">Marjorie Evasco</a>, Fanny Llego, Grace Monte de Ramos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5122\">Merlinda Bobis</a>, Ruth Elynia Mabanglo, Lina Sagaral Reyes, Nerissa Balce-Cortes, Rosario Cruz-Lucero, and Lilia Quindoza-Santiago. The group had several projects&mdash;among them, a bookshop, a research project about the babaylan (shaman) in Bohol, WICCA greeting cards, and several women&rsquo;s workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two writers&rsquo; groups active at PUP were the Pambansang Linangan at Ugnayan ng mga Manunulat or PLUMA, led by Rogelio Ordo&ntilde;ez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5394\">Ave Perez Jacob</a>, and the Pandayan ng Literaturang Pilipino or Pandaylipi, 1977, headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5740\">Cesario Torres</a>. PLUMA was a trisectoral organization of workers, students, and professional writers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other groups that held their own literary workshops and readings were the following: the Bestiario Writers&rsquo; Foundation, established in 1985, by Jose Y. Dalisay Jr, Isabel Banzon, Benedicto Bitonio, and Gina Apostol, and later joined by Charlson Ong, Anthony F. V. Serrano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5575\">Ma. Elena Paterno</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5632\">Danton Remoto</a>; and the Literary League of the Philippines, established in 1986 by Efren Abueg, Alfredo Tiamzon, and Angelito Santos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside of Metro Manila are these groups: the Gunglo Dagiti Mannurat nga Ilokano iti Filipinas Inc (<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5363\">GUMIL-Filipinas</a>) or the Ilokano Writers&rsquo; Association of the Philippines Inc; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5678\">Sanghiran san Binisaya</a>, based in Leyte and Samar; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5712\">Sumakwelan of Vernacular Writers</a> in Western Visayas; the Samar Alliance; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5464\">Lubas sa Dagang Bisaya</a> or LUDABI of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> writers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_10\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The GUMIL is the umbrella organization of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> writers here and abroad. Among its activities are regular and annual workshops and conferences. The group has come up with several publications, such as <b><i>Alintatao</i></b> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye), 1981, an anthology of short stories and poems in Ilocano, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2026\">Kurditan: Mga Kwentong Iluko</a> </i></b>(Canvas with Images: Ilocano Stories), 1988, an anthology of Ilocano short stories translated into Tagalog. Today the group has 11 provincial chapters, including Pangasinan, La Union, and Metro Manila, as well as seven overseas chapters in as far away as Greece. <b><i>Balikas</i></b> is its official quarterly newsletter, which includes literary pieces in Ilocano written by members. Since 2010, it has run the Pasnaan Literary Workshop for beginning writers in Ilocano. Ilocano writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5269\">Reynaldo Duque</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5617\">Cles Rambaud</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5057\">Roy Aragon</a> continue to be associated with the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important organization in the development of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a> literature is the Sanghiran san Binisaya. The organization was founded in 1909 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3225\">Norberto Romualdez Sr</a> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5242\">Jaime C. de Veyra</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5744\">Casiano L. Trinchera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2731\">Francisco Alvarado</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3063\">Iluminado Lucente</a>, Juan Ricacho, Francisco Enfectana, Espiridion Brillo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5479\">Eduardo Makabenta</a> as its members. Among its most notable achievements are establishing the alphabet and the orthography for Waray in 1923, making the Sanghiran an academy similar to the Academia Real of Spain, and influencing the direction of Waray literature from 1910 to the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Western Visayas, considered the most durable among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> literary societies is the Sumakwelan. Founded in 1948, the group had among its members <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5525\">Ramon Muzones</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5536\">Conrado Norada</a>, Emilio Zaldivar, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5518\">Lino Moles</a>. The organization continues today with chapters in Negros Occidental, Capiz, and Antique. Among its activities are contests, revivals, and seminars that promote and preserve Ilonggo. Under the leadership of poet and retired judge <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5559\">Nilo Pamonag</a>, the group published the groundbreaking Hiligaynon grammar book <b><i>Pulong Hiligaynon para sa <strong>Tanan</strong></i></b> (Hiligaynon Language for All), 2010. The book has two parts&mdash;namely, fundamental principles of Hiligaynon and the affixes, and Hiligaynon rules of spelling, correct usage, and other salient aspects. The anthology <b><i>Mga Bahandi sang Hiligaynon: Mga Pagdayaw sa Hara at mga Binalaybay </i></b>(Hiligaynon Treasure: Praises for Hara and Poems) came out in 2011. Sumakwelan also holds literary contests in Hiligaynon for students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In other regions, writers have been active in other larger organizations, such as the Banaag in Cebu and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3030\">Kulturang Atin Foundation</a> in Davao. Other writers have also been based in the academe, such as those active at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the revolutionary underground, a number of writers organized the Artista at Manunulat ng Sambayanan (Armas), founded in 1987 and affiliated with the National Democratic Front. Its members recognize the need not only for committed literature reminiscent of the line followed by the Philippine Writers&rsquo; League in the 1940s and PAKSA in the 1970s, but also for writers to work in the interests of the basic masses and the national democratic revolution. In a statement in Filipino issued during the Aquino administration, Armas called for revolutionary writers and artists to use art and literature to fight imperialism, to promote the vision of national democracy, and to work with and in behalf of workers and peasants (Guillermo 1990, 32-33).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1990s saw the Internet transform the way writers formed groups. It facilitated communication across distances, made works posted online accessible and facilitated archiving, and helped groups widen their reach by helping them publicize their activities. Programs remained primarily geared toward publication, although there was also a marked increase in clinics and workshops, aimed at promoting the appreciation and practice of literature to a broader audience. Public readings continued in diverse venues, from bars and auditoriums to picket lines at rallies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">The combination of this leap in technology, a number of state incentives, and the increasing &ldquo;academization&rdquo; of writing in schools and universities contributed further to the thriving of organizations. Regional groups outside the already established communities of Cebuano, Hiligaynon, and Ilocano writers were formed. Spurred by a renewed critical interest post-EDSA in regional literature and, in some cases, underwritten by grants from state cultural institutions like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>), writers in the regional languages have formed pioneering groups while established organizations have broadened their reach. Most emerged out of the academe, but there are some that are based in communities and operate in the grassroots. These groups seek to promote either a language, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a>, Waray, or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, or a place, like Cavite, Baguio, or Davao, in continuing response to the lopsided development of writing outside Manila. To that end, they give workshops </span>and clinics to budding writers in the region and publish works that would otherwise have not found a venue.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_11\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Baguio Writers Group was founded in 1998, professing to &ldquo;celebrate Cordilleran literature and nurture the souls of Cordilleran writers.&rdquo; Its activities include poetry readings and workshops intended for beginning writers. Founding members include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5103\">Cirilo F. Bautista</a>, Nap Javier, Francis Macansantos, Luisa Igloria, and Gabriel Baban Keith. The anthologies <b><i>The Baguio We Know</i></b>, 2009, and <b><i>Baguio Calligraphy</i></b>, 2010, are two of the group&rsquo;s publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Pangasinan, the group Ulupan na Pansiansiay Salitan Pangasinan launched a literary magazine called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5084\"><b><i>Balon Silew</i></b></a> in 2000, the first outlet for writing in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a> language since <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5478\">Maria Magsano</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Silew</i></b> (Light) in the 1930s. The publication helped resurrect writing in the Pangasinan language, as it encouraged the local literati and public school teachers, among others, to write again in Pangasinan. Among the more prominent contributors to the magazine is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5769\">Santiago Villafania</a>, one of the more prolific writers from the province. The group also holds creative writing seminars and workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Southern Luzon, the formation of the Cavite Young Writers Association in 2003 was encouraged by Tagalog novelist Efren Abueg. The group, composed mostly of students from the universities in the province, strives to hone the literary consciousness of its members, promote the study of Cavite-born writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5106\">Teo Baylen</a> and Alejandro G. Abadilla, and emphasize a Cavite &ldquo;brand&rdquo; of writing. Over the years, the group has helped publish several anthologies and has participated in cultural events. It holds small gatherings in a member&rsquo;s house where personal projects are discussed and one another&rsquo;s works critiqued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pride in the legacy of a province is also the driving force behind the groups <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3680\">Neo-Angono Artists Collective</a> and the Angono 3/7 Poetry Society in Rizal. The Neo-Angono Artists Collective, which counts visual artists, writers, musicians, filmmakers, art critics, and cultural workers as members, has given free poetry workshops and seminars to students from all over Rizal province. The Angono 3/7 Poetry Society conducts weekly workshops among members and publishes chapbooks. It published <b><i>In(ter)vention kina Maestro Lucio at <strong>Botong</strong></i></b>, 2012, an anthology of poems about Angono-born National Artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4162\">Lucio San Pedro</a>. Both groups have extensive collaboration with the local government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Quezon, Kuta ng Sining is a province-wide organization of artists and culture advocates based in Lucena City. The Guni-Guri Collective calls itself as an &ldquo;alternative artists&rsquo; group&rdquo; composed of visual and multimedia artists, musicians, and writers. The group was founded in 2010 by mostly visual artists until it was opened up to other artists who espouse the same &ldquo;progressive and pro-people orientation&rdquo; (Mallari 2014). Members are encouraged to hone and practice their craft in their own communities, and in the process educate others on how art can help society. Regular activities include workshops, exhibits, and outreach efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Bicol region witnessed perhaps the most pronounced and sustained surge in organizing activity from a virtual lack in the past. This development occurred alongside a resurgence of Bikol literature and corresponding critical attention. Aside from attempts to establish a big, region-wide organization, what particularly invigorated the scene were spirited efforts by small, mostly youthful groups gearing to promote literature in their respective communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5413\">Kabulig-Bikol</a> started in 1993 from the idea of Bikol writer and academic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5626\">Maria Lilia F. Realubit</a>, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5018\">Rudy Alano</a> as the first president and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5581\">Frank Pe&ntilde;ones </a>as one of the founding members. After being dormant in 1995-99, it was revived in 2000 to help set up Pagsurat Bikolnon, the first conference of Bikol writers, and its iterations in 2004 and 2008. It became a more compact organization in 2004, holding regular meetings and discussions on Bikol art, culture, language, and literature. Its activities include workshops, such as the Arejola workshop in Pili, Camarines Sur. <b><i>Bangraw </i></b>is its literary magazine. Over the years it became the umbrella organization with chapters in Naga, Iriga, and Albay. Prominent members include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5182\">Kristian Cordero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3058\">Jazmin Llana</a>, Honesto Pesimo Jr, Marissa Reorizo-Redburn, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5689\">Paz Verdades-Santos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5492\">Rizaldy Manrique</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Kabulig-Bikol began to wane in 2010, a breakaway group &ldquo;from the margins&rdquo; founded Parasurat Bikolnon. Pioneer members include Marissa Redburn, an entrepreneur from Masbate; Irvin Sto. Tomas, a government employee and Bikol orthography expert from Camarines Sur; and Jerome Hipolito, a college instructor at the Central Bicol State University of Agriculture. The group worked in the grassroots of their communities, differentiating themselves from the mostly academe-based initiatives of Kabulig-Bikol. They run the annual Saringsing Writers Workshop and Aking Parabasa, geared at promoting reading among children. It has also sponsored TigsTXT and Padurunongan, contests that seek to promote the <b>tigsik</b>, a traditional Bikolnon poetry form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another grassroots effort is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5039\">An Banwa: Kultura buda Arte kan Tabaco</a> (ABKAT), a community-based arts and culture group. Set up in 2005 by young artists, ABKAT aims to spearhead the research, development, and promotion of Bikol culture and language through the arts. Its most sustained activity is a monthly multi-genre cultural show called Pagtanyog (To Shake). It has been presented in barangays and schools, as well as aired over the radio. The group also organized conferences and workshops, such as the Tabaco Writers&rsquo; Workshop in 2007 and the Albayanong Parasurat Workshop in 2011 and 2012. It also held competitions, such as Seeds: Tabak Literary Contest. They have published anthologies and books, and helped spread Bikol literature on the ground by distributing to pedicabs stickers that contained tigsik verses. Its <b><i>Haraya</i></b> art magazine and <b><i>Salabay</i></b> poetry chapbook series are its other publication projects, in conjunction with concerts, art workshops, and theater performances, all in the Bikol languages. Founders include playwright Richard Madrilejos, filmmaker Frederick Maurice Lim, poet Noel Dorente, and musician Julius Bariso.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Western Visayas has also enjoyed a renewed, if short-lived, literary scene in the 1990s, which resulted in the formation of literary groups that complemented the continued activities of Sumakwelan. The formation of small groups was driven largely by the efforts of senior writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5255\">Leoncio Deriada</a> and incentives from the CCP. However, their inability to expand membership beyond the original core group led to their eventual demise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">It was the participants of Deriada&rsquo;s workshops in Iloilo, Antique, and Aklan who formed the Aklanon Literary Circle in the early 1990s. Early members include young writers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5175\">Melchor Cichon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5093\">John E. Barrios</a>, Alex de Juan, and Joeffrey Ricafuente, who was the group&rsquo;s first president. Envisioned as a group that would revive and promote Aklanon literature, the group started the monthly journal <b><i>Bueabod</i></b> in 2005 and came out with nine issues until it folded in Sep 2006 when De Juan and Barrios graduated from college. The group tried to resurrect it in 2010 with an issue that contained a short story by Barrios and some Aklanon poems, but the revival was short-lived, and the Aklanon Literary Circle ceased to exist afterward.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was the same story for a group of Karay-a writers called Tabig, which was formed in 1989 during the last days of another CCP-funded workshop. Tabig&rsquo;s founding members include Alex de los Santos, Ma. Milagros Geremia-Lachica, Acay Flores, Leah Pagunsan, Edison Tondares, and Moi Magbanua. Tabig remained a small group, whose members, mostly students, would leave upon graduation. It held workshops, exhibits, and readings. The revival of Karay-a literature is its lasting achievement. After its core members became involved with other things, the group also ceased to exist in the late 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tarangban Literary Guild, based in the University of San Agustin in Iloilo, traces its roots to the Mirror Poetry Guild, a group adjunct to the school&rsquo;s campus publication. First members include alumni of the San Agustin Regional Writers Workshop, organized by the writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5723\">John Iremil Teodoro</a>. Later, the group accepted non-alumni and branched out to genres other than poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Eastern Visayas, the writer Harold Mercurio helped spur the formation of organizations during his term as regional coordinator of the NCCA&rsquo;s National Committee on Literary Arts. Based in Tacloban, the Katig-ubanhan <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">mga Magsusurat ha Sinirangan Bisayas, or the Katig Writers Network, is an umbrella organization of writers in Leyte, Samar, and Biliran and Capul Islands. Under it are the groups Calbayog Literary Arts Organization in Calbayog, Samar; the Abaknon Literary Arts Guild in Capul, Northern Samar; the Sirak Writers in Borongan City, Eastern Samar; and the Bisdak Writers in Biliran. The groups aim to revive and spur writing in Waray, Cebuano, and Inabaknon, the language spoken in Capul Island.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Mindanao, two groups that helped revitalize writing in the region are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5214\">Davao Writers Guild</a> (DWG) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5100\">Bathalad-Mindanao</a>. Their efforts were toward the publication of works that highlight the creative output of writers from the region and, in the case of Bathalad-Mindanao, the &ldquo;Bisaya&rdquo; language as a distinct variant of the Cebuano used in Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_12\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The DWG, set up in 1999 by the formerly Manila-based poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5241\">Ricardo de Ungria</a>, is responsible for <b><i>Dagmay</i></b>, which started in 2001 as a quarterly newsletter before eventually becoming a monthly supplement to the newspaper <b><i>Sun Star Davao </i></b>and, later, a Sunday literary page. Among those published under the group&rsquo;s <b><i>Tubaw </i></b>book series were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5552\">Don Pagusara</a>&rsquo;s Cebuano and English poetry collection <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1936\"><strong>Qontrapuntal</strong></a></i></b>, 2003; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5732\">Macario Tiu</a>&rsquo;s English story collection <b><i>Sky Rose</i></b>, 2003; and Josie Tejada&rsquo;s English story collection <b><i>The House on Calle Seminario</i></b>, 2007. With help from NCAA, the group has published several other books, including two anthologies of Mindanao writing. It has either co-sponsored or instituted workshops, with all fellows coming from Mindanao, including its very own Davao Writers Workshop in 2009. Members include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5650\">Aida Rivera-Ford</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5430\">Tita Lacambra-Ayala</a>, Margarita Marfori, Eva Socorro Aranas, Josie Tejada, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5052\">Saturnino P. Apoyon</a>, its first president. The DWG has a youth wing called the Young Davao Writers, which holds an annual poetry reading event called &ldquo;LitOrgy,&rdquo; directed at a young audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Originally a chapter of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5099\">Bathalad-Cebu</a>, Bathalad-Mindanao is a small gathering of writers in Cagayan de Oro which eventually expanded to Bukidnon, Lanao, Davao, Cotabato, Butuan, Surigao, and Zamboanga. Its major projects include the creation of a Bisaya dictionary and thesaurus and establishing the Bisaya orthography toward developing writing and readership in the language. In addition, the group seeks to increase interest in the diverse cultures and concerns of Bisaya writing and publish works to heighten national awareness. Members include Rey Poloyapoy, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5613\">Gumer Rafanan</a>, Arturo Pe&ntilde;aserada, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5266\">Richel Dorotan</a>, Jonecito Saguban, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5333\">Marcelo Geocallo</a>, and Anito Beronilla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1990s and 2000s also saw the flourishing of creative writing centers based in universities, following in the heels of the UP Creative Writing Center, established in 1978 and renamed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5450\">Likhaan: The UP Institute of Creative Writing</a> in 2002. These include the Ateneo Institute of Literary Arts and Practices, 2000; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5234\">De La Salle University Bienvenido N. Santos Creative Writing Center</a>, 1991; the UST Center for Creative Writing and Literary Studies, 1999, reopened, 2012; the Silliman University Edilberto K. Tiempo and Edith L. Tiempo Creative Writing Center, 2012; and the PUP Sentro Para sa Malikhaing Pagsulat, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_13\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Campus organizations continue to be a training ground for budding writers, although no contemporary group has achieved the status of the UP Writers&rsquo; Club during the late 1920s. Workshops among members and nonmembers are a common activity, as are the publication of folios and zines and school-wide literary competitions. These campus-based groups include the UP Quill and the UP Ugnayan ng Manunulat or UP Ugat in UP Diliman; the Samahang L.A.Y.B. in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os; Literary Society and Tinta in UP Mindanao; Ateneo de Manila&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5371\">Heights</a>; Ateneo de Davao&rsquo;s Society of Ateneo Literature and English Majors; the DLSU Writers Guild and Malate Literary Folio of De La Salle University; the Thomasian Writers Guild of UST; and the FEU Writers Guild of Far Eastern University. In 2011, there was a collaborative effort among the UP Writers&rsquo; Club, Heights, Malate Literary Folio, and the Thomasian Writers Guild, with the publication of <b><i>Buklod</i></b>, featuring works from members and alumni of the four organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">UMPIL and Philippine PEN continued to be the two biggest nationwide organizations of writers, both with continuing ties with academe and state cultural institutions. Outside the big organizations with institutional support, there were spirited efforts mostly by poets to organize and promote literature through regular readings, workshops, and so-called alternative publication. The most sustained effort to this end has been that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5379\">High Chair</a>, a small nonprofit press. High Chair has refused institutional backing, traditional distribution channels like commercial bookstores, and maximum revenue schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">High Chair has not explicitly defined an aesthetic, although the influence of modernism may be detected in the works of members. Among those who founded it are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5603\">Allan Popa</a>, Marc Gaba, Mabi David, Alex Gregorio, and Kristine Domingo. Other poets who came to be identified with the group include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5195\">Conchitina Cruz</a>, Adam David, Vincenz Serrano, Mark Anthony Cayanan, Mesandel Virtusio Arguelles, Jose Perez Beduya, Oliver Ortega, and Joseph de Luna Saguid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beginning informally in 2001 and officially organized the following year, High Chair comes out with a semiannual online journal of poems, essays, and interviews. A special issue, in 2009, was on the Maguindanao Massacre. The books it published include Popa&rsquo;s <b><i>Kami sa Lahat ng Masama </i></b>(We from All Evil), 2003; Gregorio&rsquo;s <b><i>The Rosegun</i></b>, 2004; Arguelles&rsquo;s <b><i>Ilahas</i></b> (Feral), 2004; Cruz&rsquo;s <b><i>Elsewhere Held and Lingered</i></b>, 2008; Gaba&rsquo;s <b><i>Nouveau Bored</i></b>, 2009; and David&rsquo;s <b><i>You Are Here</i></b>, 2009. In 2011, it launched a poetry appreciation program called Compass. Members visit school- and community-based writers&rsquo; groups and conduct discussions and workshops using a unique teaching module it has developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Learning and interaction&rdquo; are the main thrusts behind Pinoypoets, formed in 2004, a group of poets and poetry enthusiasts. Disavowing any political ideology or advocacy, the group aims to provide a venue for members to enrich their knowledge and improve their craft. It has held workshops, published chapbooks, and produced a CD featuring original poems written and read by members. Its online activities include posting of poems for workshop as well as writing exercises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-2000s, another group of poets, led by Joel Toledo and Andrea Teran, started Happy Mondays, a biweekly poetry reading series, which had also come to refer to the loose collective of writers who frequented the readings and held informal workshops and discussions. The readings took place at Mag:net Caf&eacute; and Gallery in Quezon City and, later, in other venues. Regular members include Arkaye Kierulf, Rafael San Diego, Naya Valdellon, Marie La Vi&ntilde;a, Allan Pastrana, Pocholo Goitia, and Daryll Delgado, although Almario, Gemino Abad, Jose Lacaba, Krip Yuson, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5326\">J. Neil Garcia</a>, Marjorie Evasco, Marne Kilates, Angelo Suarez, Conchitina Cruz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5243\">Lourd de Veyra</a>, and Mookie Katigbak have each at one point read at a Happy Mondays event. Like High Chair, the group demurs at professing a single poetic aesthetic, although a cursory survey of its members&rsquo; works would reveal an inclination toward a poetry of affect, the same one fostered in the workshop circuit, where almost all its members have emerged from.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1545\">children&rsquo;s literature</a>, Kuwentista ng mga Tsikiting (Kuting) is credited by the Reading Association of the Philippines for &ldquo;having professionalized writing for children, raising it to the level of art, and for ensuring the emergence of the Golden Age of children&rsquo;s literature&rdquo; (Alba 2003). Formed during the 1995 UP National Writers Workshop, Kuting was composed of university teachers, journalists, visual artists, writers for TV, and students. Members formed a support network for the then-burgeoning genre, pushing for writers&rsquo; rights in the children&rsquo;s book publishing industry and sharing opportunities with each other. They also hold workshops and seminars exclusive to members, as well as outreach activities like storytelling sessions and book drives for the benefit of children in need. Its publication projects include <b><i>Water in the Ring of Fire</i></b>, 1996, an anthology of folktales from the Asia Pacific region, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5549\">Carla Pacis</a>, features Kuting members. Members include Pacis, Lara Saguisag, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5648\">Augie Rivera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5329\">Luis Gatmaitan</a>, Heidi Eusebio-Abad, Becky Bravo, May Tobias-Papa, Robert Magnuson, and Rhandee Garlitos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Another group credited for invigorating a genre is the Lit Critters, organized by the writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5029\">Dean Alfar</a> in 2006. Its regular critiquing sessions are grounded on what its manifesto asserts as the value of speculative fiction, or &ldquo;non-realist&rdquo; fiction, as &ldquo;a valid and vibrant form of literature&rdquo; (Alfar 2014). Early sessions were devoted to craft, technique, and literary theory, and, later, workshops. From the core group&mdash;Alfar and his wife Nikki, Kate and Alexander Osias, Andrew Drilon, and Vincent Michael Simbulan&mdash;the group&rsquo;s membership has expanded to include Charles Tan, Kenneth Yu, Elyss Punsalan, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5164\">Ian Rosales Casocot</a>, who leads its Dumaguete chapter. Its contribution to Philippine letters is the assimilation of speculative fiction into the mainstream, evident in the thriving community of readers, especially of Alfar&rsquo;s Philippine Speculative Fiction series, which began in 2005.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Creators and enthusiasts of graphic literature also formed groups, championing the genre and helping spur its resurgence in the 1990s and 2000s, as well as asserting a Filipino quality in the traditionally Western form. A pioneering group is Alamat Comics. Inspired by noted Filipino-American comic book writer and artist Whilce Portacio, Alamat was founded in 1994 as an umbrella organization of independent Filipino comic book creators and studios. Founding members include Gerry Alanguilan, Carlo Vergara, David Hontiveros, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5062\">Arnold Arre</a>, Budjette Tan, Bow Guerrero, J. B. Tapia, and others. Portacio rallied them to work together under one banner that people would easily identify as a &ldquo;Philippine-made comic book.&rdquo; True enough, Alamat single-handedly helped Filipinos carve a niche in an industry traditionally ruled by American titles. Their pioneering efforts are credited for revivifying the local comic book industry. While individual groups still funded the printing and distribution of their comic books, Alamat as an organization became a central promotional office, in which information, such as affordable printing presses, is shared and publicity for Alamat titles is emphasized. Alamat creators mounted exhibits in rock clubs and galleries. They were invited to conduct workshops and seminars in schools. Since 2005, only a handful of the original Alamat members have remained active. While some have set up their own publishing companies or are being published by a commercial press, they continue to place the Alamat logo on the cover of their works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">A newer group is Studio Salimbal, which takes its name from the mythological ship in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> lore that transports people to heaven. Established in 2013, it is run by professional graphic artists Elbert Or and Paolo Chikiamco and counts as members industry stalwarts such as Budjette Tan and Mervin Malonzo, as well as young artists Koi Carreon and Cristina Rose Chua. Like Alamat, the group aims to &ldquo;create avenues for sustainable production of comic books and creative intellectual properties.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_14\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Independent groups include Meganon Comics and Gerry Alanguilan&rsquo;s Komikero Artists Group based in San Pablo, Laguna. Meganon Comics is a group of young independent artists and writers who aim to foster a more sustainable indie comics community by assisting creators in publishing their works and reaching a wider market. The core group includes Tepai Pascual, Maika Ezawa, Paolo Herras, and Brent Sabas. The Komikero Artists Group is a loose gathering of mostly comic book artists, but it includes painters, photographers, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation</a> artists. The group occasionally organizes events, including the San Pablo Comics Art Festival in 2003, 2009, and 2011. Active members include Jonas Diego, Johnny Danganan, Kevin Ray Valentino, Jason Torres, Brian Balondo, Dexter Entera, Ryan Toledo, and Geoff Borgonia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from building a thriving community of comic book artists and enthusiasts, the comic book organizations mentioned have helped create a Filipino aesthetic and sensibility in the comic book genre, with works that use elements drawn from local myths and folklore or that rework foreign genres to tell Filipino stories. Most of the stories in Alamat titles are set in the Philippines, with a good mix of genres, ranging from Pinoy superheroes to space opera and science fiction. Studio Salimbal has a project called &ldquo;Mythspace,&rdquo; a &ldquo;space opera&rdquo; that reimagines Philippine folklore creatures as aliens, and &ldquo;Bravos,&rdquo; which is set in a universe where the Philippines has a monopoly on superpowers. For his San Pablo group, Alanguilan discourages the use of styles closely associated with other cultures, like Japanese manga. There is also a conscious effort to promote the works of old masters of Filipino comics, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3477\">Francisco Coching</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3732\">Nestor Redondo</a>, Alfredo Alcala, and Alex Ni&ntilde;o.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Campus organizations, like the UP Graphic Arts in Literature (GRAIL), established in 1999, provide a venue for young creators and enthusiasts to nourish their interest in the genre. UP GRAIL participates in local comic book conventions by showcasing its annual anthologies, created by members. Skills improvement is also on the agenda, with its scriptwriting, layout, paneling, and general art workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Progressive post-EDSA writers&rsquo; groups, mostly in the ranks of the youth, continue to emphasize the political role of art and writers in society in the tradition of PAKSA. Kilometer 64 and Kataga (Word) profess to abiding by a critique of history and society as they seek to bring literature closer to the masses. Founded in 2003, Kilometer 64, or KM 64, gets its name from the initials of Kabataang Makabayan and the year it was established, 1964. Members write nationalist poetry, which they disseminate through publications and public readings in bars, schools, picket lines, and urban poor communities. Its first efforts include a pamphlet of anti-imperialist poetry printed in time for US President George W. Bush Jr&rsquo;s Philippine visit. Its chapbooks include <b><i>Ped Xing </i></b>(Pedestrian Crossing), <b><i>Chacha: Sayaw sa Bubog</i></b> (Chacha: Dance in Broken Glass), and <b><i>Please Fasten Your Seatbelt</i></b>, all published in 2004, and <b><i>Kabyawan</i></b> (Sugar Mill), 2005, which recounts the harsh plight of tenants in Hacienda Luisita. In the same year, during KM&rsquo;s 40th anniversary, KM 64 published <b><i>40: Mga Tulang Alay sa mga Martir na Kabataan</i></b> (40: Poems Dedicated to Youth Martyrs), which consists of poems written by members and nonmembers: Lumbera, Jesus Manuel Santiago, Domingo Landicho, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5428\">Emmanuel Lacaba</a> and Amado V. Hernandez. Tulagalag, a portmanteau of the words &ldquo;tula&rdquo; (poem) and &ldquo;lagalag&rdquo; (wanderer), is a mobile and public poetry initiative in which poems are posted in public places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kataga was formed by Reuel Aguila in 2008. It published its first anthology, <b><i>Kataga 1</i></b> (Word 1), in 2013. The introduction to the book stressed the need for writers to go beyond their private concerns and ensure that their works reach their audience. The poems engage human rights violation, enforced disappearances, poverty, and the indignities of daily life in a society as grossly unequal as the Philippines. A satellite chapter in the Quezon province is Kataga-Lucena, which is composed of two divisions, Panitikan (Literature) and Pagtatanghal (Performance). Other Kataga chapters can be found in Manila, Quezon City, and Zambales. There is also a Kataga chapter online.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In general, there are three reasons why organizations are formed. One is to provide a venue for writers to develop their craft by training and interaction; another is to seek opportunities and venues for the publication of their works; a third is to articulate a particular vision of society through literature and advance this by means of a political agenda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The organizational affiliation of writers may provide clues in the study of their works as one divines or attempts to determine their sources and influences. The mentorship of organizations by established writers&mdash;like Virgilio S. Almario for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5314\">Galian sa Arte at Tula</a> (GAT) and, later, LIRA; Fidel Rillo for Katha; and N. V. M. Gonzalez for the Ravens&mdash;can exert an influence on the style and substance of a writer&rsquo;s craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the writing community in the Philippines remains small and largely parochial, almost all writers tend to belong to groups, whether informal cliques or big organizations. This dynamic makes organizations vital transmission grounds for the spread of aesthetic and political predispositions, which over time can shape the country&rsquo;s overall literary landscape. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Rolando B.

Writers may organize themselves because of a common worldview, political ideology, or intellectual temperament. Others form groups for publication and workshop projects. Writers have also been known to get together for the sake of literary fellowship and sharing of artistic output, with some ritualistic elements involved. Groups outside of Manila have strengthened their ranks so that they may continue to assert regional writing and identity, in the process contributing to the development of a multiethnic body of national literature."

Active members include Jonas Diego, Johnny Danganan, Kevin Ray Valentino, Jason Torres, Brian Balondo, Dexter Entera, Ryan Toledo, and Geoff Borgonia."

Most of the stories in Alamat titles are set in the Philippines, with a good mix of genres, ranging from Pinoy superheroes to space opera and science fiction. Studio Salimbal has a project called &#x201C;Mythspace,&#x201D; a &#x201C;space opera&#x201D; that reimagines Philippine folklore creatures as aliens, and &#x201C;Bravos,&#x201D; which is set in a universe where the Philippines has a monopoly on superpowers. For his San Pablo group, Alanguilan discourages the use of styles closely associated with other cultures, like Japanese manga. There is also a conscious effort to promote the works of old masters of Filipino comics, including <a href=\"/3/3/3477\">Francisco Coching</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3732\">Nestor Redondo</a>, Alfredo Alcala, and Alex Ni&#xF1;o."

Kilometer 64 and Kataga (Word) profess to abiding by a critique of history and society as they seek to bring literature closer to the masses. Founded in 2003, Kilometer 64, or KM 64, gets its name from the initials of Kabataang Makabayan and the year it was established, 1964. Members write nationalist poetry, which they disseminate through publications and public readings in bars, schools, picket lines, and urban poor communities. Its first efforts include a pamphlet of anti-imperialist poetry printed in time for US President George W. Bush Jr&#x2019;s Philippine visit. Its chapbooks include <b><i>Ped Xing </i></b>(Pedestrian Crossing), <b><i>Chacha: Sayaw sa Bubog</i></b> (Chacha: Dance in Broken Glass), and <b><i>Please Fasten Your Seatbelt</i></b>, all published in 2004, and <b><i>Kabyawan</i></b> (Sugar Mill), 2005, which recounts the harsh plight of tenants in Hacienda Luisita. In the same year, during KM&#x2019;s 40th anniversary, KM 64 published <b><i>40: Mga Tulang Alay sa mga Martir na Kabataan</i></b> (40: Poems Dedicated to Youth Martyrs), which consists of poems written by members and nonmembers: Lumbera, Jesus Manuel Santiago, Domingo Landicho, <a href=\"/9/9/5428\">Emmanuel Lacaba</a> and Amado V. Hernandez. Tulagalag, a portmanteau of the words &#x201C;tula&#x201D; (poem) and &#x201C;lagalag&#x201D; (wanderer), is a mobile and public poetry initiative in which poems are posted in public places."

The poems engage human rights violation, enforced disappearances, poverty, and the indignities of daily life in a society as grossly unequal as the Philippines. A satellite chapter in the Quezon province is Kataga-Lucena, which is composed of two divisions, Panitikan (Literature) and Pagtatanghal (Performance).

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Literary training</b> is the process by which writers learn their craft. In the Philippines, this activity includes the training of students in the creation and transmission of oral literature, formal education in universities offering creative or imaginative writing courses, and workshops offered by cultural institutions and organizations involved in literary creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the case of oral literature, because it is continually evolving, the singer and the storyteller are themselves creators of literary works. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, for example, accretion and omission occur; characters, elements, and passages are added, embellished, or deleted. Some forms of literary expression may be etched on bamboo like the <b>surat <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The epic is learned at an early age, usually from a relative. Pagyaw, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5493\">E. Arsenio Manuel</a>&rsquo;s source for the Manobo songs <b><i>The Maiden of the Buhong Sky</i></b> and <b><i><strong>Tuwaang</strong> Attends a Wedding</i></b>, learned them from a bard named Inuk, who belonged to a family of epic chanters. Liyos Ambog, the source for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2372\">Subanon</a> epic <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1962\"><strong>Ag Tobig nog Keboklagan</strong></a></i></b> (The Kingdom of Keboklagan), learned it from her mother Anaya. Anaya&rsquo;s mother Sapar had learned it at the age of six. Blagtas Pandakan, the source for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1831\"><b><i>Agyu</i></b></a>, learned the epic from his uncle Sugalan, who, in turn, had learned it from his father Ampalid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Precolonial poets followed rules, learning from childhood that each stanza consisted of three, four, or five lines with a single assonantal rhyme (Lumbera 1986). The conventions of oral literary forms, such as formulaic repetitions, stereotyping of characters, and regular rhythmic and musical devices&mdash;learned during childhood&mdash;facilitated the transmission of poems, songs, tales, and sayings. Over time, the origin and original meaning of the words may be lost as the songs are learned by rote. The contemporary <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>, once practicing an animistic religion, have become Christians, and call their place Santa Cruz instead of Lemlunay. They continue to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chant</a> a song about Lemlunay taught to them by the babaylan (priestess), yet they cannot explain the meaning of the phrases &ldquo;spirits that guard&rdquo; and &ldquo;spirits that destroy&rdquo; (Almario 1991).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Spanish colonial period, European poetic forms were introduced by the Spanish friars who ran printing presses and published books. The octosyllabic romance, for example, was used by Fr Francisco de San Jose in <b><i>Memorial de la Vida Christiana en Lengua Tagala</i> </b>(Guidelines for the Christian Life in the Tagalog Language), 1605. It was also in this book that the term <b>ladino</b> was first used to refer to poems in both Spanish and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, and to poets writing in this manner. The first verses written by Filipinos using the romance are attributed to Fernando Bagongbanta and the anonymous author of the poem &ldquo;May Bagyo Ma&rsquo;t May Rilim&rdquo; (Though It is Stormy and Dark). During the 18th century, Tondo became known as a center for poets. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5228\">Jose de la Cruz</a>, considered to be the best among them, is said to have taught himself philosophy and canon law. He became the teacher of many aspiring poets, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a> aka Balagtas, Ananias Zorilla, Tomas Ledo, and the brothers Juan and Prudencio Feliciano. De la Cruz reputedly charged a <i>sisiw</i> (chick) for lessons, thus earning the epithet &ldquo;Huseng Sisiw.&rdquo; De la Cruz wrote poems at the request of young men courting women, and he scripted dramas commissioned by committees for town fiestas. In this way, the language of Tagalog poetry &ldquo;moved from the earthiness of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5056\">Gaspar Aquino de Belen</a> to the refinement and elegance of Jose de la Cruz.&rdquo; Poetic diction may be said to have begun with De la Cruz (Lumbera 1986, 103).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was Balagtas&rsquo;s works which represented the fusion of all the traditions of Tagalog poetry from the 16th to the 19th century. After obtaining the equivalent of a high school education at the San Juan de Letran, Balagtas took higher studies, which included Latin, philosophy, theology, canon law, and Roman and Spanish laws, at the Colegio de San Jose. His works show that he had read Virgil and Homer and was familiar with Greek and Roman mythology. In <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Florante and Laura), ca. 1838, Balagtas not only employs the <b>talinghaga</b> and the monorhyming quatrain of precolonial Tagalog poetry; he also uses classical allusions and incorporates diverse elements of the Spanish ballad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the Spanish colonial government established a system of education in 1863, rhetoric and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> were among the courses included in programs leading to a <i>bachillerato en artes </i>(bachelor of arts). In the normal schools and universities, students read <b>trozos</b> or selections from famous Catholic and Castilian prose and verse writers like Cervantes, Mariana, Fray Luis de Leon, Herrera, Rioja, Zorilla, and Lope de Vega (Tiongson 1978).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rise of the middle class in the 19th century resulted in its sending its children to Europe to study. While no records show that they studied creative writing formally, many were influenced by, on the one hand, the literary works they read in Europe and, on the other, the folk forms familiar to them. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> studied medicine but followed the tradition of realism employed by Galdos, Balzac, Hugo, and Dickens. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>, who studied law at the University of Santo Tomas, deliberately used folk and popular forms for his poems and satirical works (Lumbera 1986, 140). Both propagandists also mastered the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\">essay</a> as shown in Rizal&rsquo;s &ldquo;Su Excelencia, Se&ntilde;or Don Vicente Barrantes&rdquo; (His Excellency, Mr Vicente Barrantes) and Del Pilar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Asimilacion de Filipinas&rdquo; (Assimilation of the Philippines).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Examples of revolutionary literature written in Tagalog using monorhyming quatrains are the trilogy of poems &ldquo;Hibik ng Pilipinas sa Inang Espa&ntilde;a (Filipinas&rsquo; Lament to Mother Spain), 1889, by Hermenegildo Flores; &ldquo;Sagot nang Espa&ntilde;a sa Hibik nang Pilipinas&rdquo; (Spain&rsquo;s Reply to Filipinas&rsquo; Lament), 1889, by Marcelo H. del Pilar; and &ldquo;Katapusang Hibik ng Pilipinas&rdquo; (Last Lament of Filipinas), 1896, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>. The first two poems were written as companion pieces; Flores was both teacher and fellow propagandist to del Pilar. Bonifacio became familiar with versification as an actor in Tagalog plays and was much inspired by Rizal&rsquo;s two novels, <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong> </i></b>(Touch Me Not), 1887, and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></i></b> (Subversion), 1891. These two factors may have contributed to the dramatic force and explicit revolutionary intent of his reply to &ldquo;Hibik&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sagot.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the establishment of the Revolutionary Government of Malolos on 23 Jun 1898, immediately created were the Universidad Literaria de Filipinas on 19 Oct 1898 and the Instituto Burgos, which set the curriculum followed by other schools. While Tagalog had been proclaimed the national language, the general curriculum continued to include the reading and writing of Spanish and the appreciation of Spanish literature. Among the teachers were writers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5349\">Leon Ma. Guerrero</a> (Tiongson 1978, 141).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the first decades of the 20th century, the American Insular Government pursued two orientations in the education of Filipinos for &ldquo;citizenship&rdquo;: industrial or manual education, begun by Fred Atkinson; and &ldquo;literary&rdquo; or liberal education, first broached by David Barrows. English was made the language of instruction in 1900. Elementary schools used the Baldwin Readers and later the Insular Readers. In high schools, students became familiar with works such as Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Evangeline&rdquo;; Irving&rsquo;s<i> <b>Sketchbook</b></i>; an anthology titled <b><i>English <strong>Poems</strong> from Chaucer to Kipling</i></b>, George Eliot&rsquo;s <b><i>Silas Marner</i></b>; and Shakespeare&rsquo;s <b><i>The Merchant of Venice</i></b> and <b><i>Macbeth</i></b> (Tiongson 1978, 141-47).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even with the establishment of more colleges and universities and the teaching of language and literature, creative writing in Tagalog or in any of the other regional languages was not taught as a subject. Instead, poets continued to follow &ldquo;rules&rdquo; learned through other poets or their works. The formalization of these rules of traditional poetry, which had come to be called <b>balagtasismo</b>, after Balagtas, was made by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K. Santos</a> in his paper &ldquo;Particularidades de la Poesia Tagala&rdquo; (Particularities of Tagalog Poetry), 1929, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a> in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1672\"><strong>Ang Tatlong Panahon ng Tulang Tagalog</strong></a></i></b> (The Three Periods of Tagalog Poetry), 1947. The formal teaching of poetry, however, has been limited to the mechanical use of rhetorical elements; observance of the basic rules on rhyme and meter; and the memorization of the <b>aral</b> (lesson) from versification. Additional elements, such as irony and tension, were studied from the works of foreign writers, such as William Empson, I. A. Richards, Paul Valery, or Charles Olson, who were deemed superior to Filipino critics and writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5332\">Teodoro E. Gener</a> or Rufino Alejandro (Almario 1991, 5).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the first-generation novelists were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5374\">Valeriano Hernandez Pe&ntilde;a</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5643\">Roman Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5306\">Gabriel Beato Francisco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>, Lope K.

Born in the late 19th century, many of them finished secondary education at Ateneo de Manila, San Juan de Letran, or the Universidad de Santo Tomas, where they became familiar with the works of Quevedo, Cervantes, Galdos, Voltaire, Zola, Dumas, and Eugene Sue. Many were also educated during the American colonial period. The works of Shakespeare, Hugo, Dante, Milton, Tolstoy, and Dumas were studied for forms and themes. These works were translated into Tagalog by Gerardo Changco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5433\">Francisco Laksamana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5067\">Narciso Asistio</a>, and Rosendo Ignacio.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Established by the American colonial government in 1908, the University of the Philippines (UP) and, in particular, its College of Arts and Sciences, greatly contributed to the rise of English as a literary language in the opening decades of the 20th century. Creative writing classes today may be traced to the composition classes under its Department of English during the American colonial period. In terms of training, no other Philippine university would go on to have a more &ldquo;significant&rdquo; and &ldquo;sustained&rdquo; impact in creative writing&mdash;particularly in English (Dalisay 2007, 7). Most of the first- and second-generation writers in English studied at UP. The undergraduate English classes served as their training ground as writers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5336\">Angela Manalang Gloria</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5148\">Casiano Calalang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5388\">F.

Among the teachers were George Pope Shannon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5500\">Paz Marquez-Benitez</a>, C. V. Wickers, Vicente M. Hilario, Cristina Jamias, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5659\">Carlos P. Romulo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5369\">A. V. H. Hartendorp</a>. Paz Marquez-Benitez, who wrote the first Filipino modern short story in English, held a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a> class thrice a week that proved to be training ground for many beginning fictionists. She encouraged new work, &ldquo;good or bad,&rdquo; helping students polish their style and technique (Alegre and Fernandez 1984, 98, 113). It was under her class where Casiano Calalang wrote &ldquo;Soft Clay,&rdquo; Paras-Sulit wrote &ldquo;Laarni,&rdquo; and Bienvenido Santos wrote &ldquo;The Years are Very Long,&rdquo; which she reputedly described as &ldquo;the best story I have read written by a Filipino.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Essay writing was taught by Professor Valenzuela, while literature teacher C. V. Wickers encouraged Angela Manalang Gloria and Luis Dato to write poetry. Other teachers included Tom Inglis Moore in poetry, Robert Conklin in advanced English, and Mrs Conklin in dramatic presentation. Today, UP Diliman is the only university that offers the full range of programs in creative writing in English and Filipino, from the two-year certificate to a PhD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Organizations also became a venue for training writers, often in the form of workshops and other methods of informal tutelage. Many of the writers who were members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5752\">UP Writers&rsquo; Club</a> or staffers of the <b><i>Philippine Collegian</i></b> held informal sessions to discuss each other&rsquo;s stories and poems as well as current literature. The works of Wilbur Daniel Steele, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Robert Frost, Carl Sandburg, Amy Lowell, Bernard Shaw, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3280\">Vidal Tan</a>, and Carlos P. Romulo were among those they discussed. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5624\">The Ravens</a>, which had started as an offshoot of the UP Writers&rsquo; Club, were mentored by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5344\">N. V. M. Gonzalez</a>, who conducted informal workshops at his residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some first-generation writers also went abroad for formal training in creative writing. Maria Kalaw-Katigbak was awarded the Barbour Scholarship in Michigan in 1933 and majored in creative writing. In 1941, Bienvenido Santos, then president of Legazpi College, went to the United States on a Rockefeller Grant and at one point studied under American novelist Philip Roth. N. V. M. Gonzalez, also on a Rockefeller, went to the United States in the late 1940s and was influenced by a number of &ldquo;Southern Agrarians&rdquo; who championed a militant regionalism that resonated with his so-called rural sensibility. All three, including Salvador P. Lopez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5788\">Leopoldo Yabes</a>, would become teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The training for some second-generation writers consisted of reading as well as of direct interaction with other writers and critics. The books of Erskine Caldwell, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Thomas Wolfe were available to them. However, it was through writing workshops that most gained access to the works of others and improved their craft. The workshop model, together with the creative writing programs in universities, would prove to be the most defining training venues for Filipino writers, especially in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5727\">Edilberto</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5728\">Edith L. Tiempo</a>, who along with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5252\">Ricaredo Demetillo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5391\">Dominador Ilio</a> were the first Asians to attend the prestigious Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop, institutionalized the workshop model in the Philippines when they established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5698\">Silliman National Writers Workshop</a> in 1962. Patterned after the pioneering Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop, it was originally under Silliman&rsquo;s English department. It traces its roots to a university-based semestral workshop that was credited for two to three units, which students could get upon official arrangement with Edilberto Tiempo. Held every summer for five, and, eventually, three weeks in Dumaguete City, the workshop discussions center on the poems, short stories, plays, and essays submitted by the participants, the majority of whom write in English. Occasional works in Filipino and other regional languages were submitted with translations until it became an all-English workshop. Applicants submit samples of their works&mdash;three to five short stories, a suite of seven poems or so, three to five essays, a play&mdash;and recommendation letters from professors or former workshop fellows. Applications average 70-80 a year. Board and lodging, as well as minimal transportation and living allowances, are provided to the chosen participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Tiempos ran the workshop for nearly 50 years, a period in which their name became synonymous with Silliman and all that it stood for in the literary world. Their daughter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5729\">Rowena Tiempo-Torrevillas</a>, herself a writer and professor at the University of Iowa, took over as director in 2011. Succeeding her were Susan Lara and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5241\">Ricardo de Ungria</a>. Over the years, regular panelists have included Dumaguete-based writers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5054\">Cesar Ruiz Aquino</a>, Myrna Pe&ntilde;a-Reyes, Bobby Villasis, and Ernesto Superal-Yee, and guest panelists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/4997\">Gemino Abad</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5034\">Merlie Alunan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5286\">Marjorie Evasco</a>, D.

Yuson</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"text-justify:distribute-all-lines\">The Silliman Workshop has had a &ldquo;tremendous influence&rdquo; in creative writing in English in the country, as well as in other writers&rsquo; workshops (Pernia 2002, 7). &ldquo;Practically all Filipino writers of any importance&rdquo; have gone to Silliman at one point, either as fellows, lecturers, or panelists (Bautista 1998). Its roster of alumni includes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5131\">Gregorio Brillantes</a>, Rogelio Sikat aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5696\">Rogelio Sicat</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5428\">Emmanuel Lacaba</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio S.

National Artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a> served as panelists at the inaugural workshop in 1962. Other former fellows include Bienvenido Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G. Fernandez</a>, N. V. M. Gonzalez, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the same way that more than half of &ldquo;second-wave&rdquo; programs in the United States were founded by Iowa graduates, subsequent workshops in the Philippines are said to be modeled after Silliman. Former Silliman fellows and panelists went on to become part of other workshops, often bringing with them the critical praxis they had learned in Dumaguete. These include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5040\">Jaime An Lim</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5720\">Anthony Tan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5337\">Christine Godinez-Ortega</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5255\">Leoncio Deriada</a> with the Iligan workshop; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5021\">Erlinda Alburo</a> with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5184\">Cornelio Faigao Workshop</a>; Ophelia Dimalanta with the UST workshop; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5501\">Elsa Coscolluela</a>, Grace Monte de Ramos, and Marjorie Evasco with the IYAS workshop; Merlie Alunan with the UP Visayas workshops; and Aida Rivera-Ford and Ricky de Ungria with the Davao Writers Workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The annual workshops in Dumaguete are also credited for the spread and ascendance of New Criticism as a critical lens and, consequently, a &ldquo;Silliman school of writing,&rdquo; which places a premium on craft above everything else (Alunan 1997, 115). Dominant in the United States from the 1940s to the 1960s, New Criticism views literary texts as autonomous, self-contained objects. The workshops at Silliman generally scrutinized works based on such standards, favoring those that have a certain &ldquo;finish, smoothness, and polish&rdquo; (119). This emphasis on aesthetics and form, while recognized for improving writers&rsquo; technique, has also been criticized for its willful disregard of context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">UP began the UP National Writers Summer Workshop three years after the founding of the Silliman workshop, in 1965, and was held every other year thereafter until 1980, when it started to be held annually for 10 days and, eventually, a week. The venue was mainly in Diliman and, occasionally, in UP&rsquo;s other campuses in Cebu, Davao, Tacloban, Miag-ao, and Baguio, where it has been held since 2003. After it was established in 1979, the UP Creative Writing Center (UPCWC) started to take charge of the workshop. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5386\">Alejandrino Hufana</a>, Francisco Arcellana, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&nbsp;served successively as directors of the center and became prime movers of the annual workshop, assisted by a workshop director. Applicants submit samples of their works, which are then evaluated by the associate directors of the UPCWC. Board and lodging, as well as a minimal allowance, are provided for the students. Works in poetry, fiction, and drama, in both English and Filipino, are discussed. Sometimes, a particular genre, theme, or audience is given focus in a workshop. For instance, the 1983 workshop was in children&rsquo;s literature, 1984 in poetry, 1985 in fiction, 1986 in drama, and 1990 in gender issues. Aside from the workshops, there are lectures and discussions on a certain topic. Among those who have been workshop directors are N. V. M. Gonzalez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5542\">Elmer Ordo&ntilde;ez</a>, Gemino Abad, Jose Dalisay Jr, Rogelio Sikat aka Rogelio Sicat, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5435\">Domingo Landicho</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5425\">Thelma</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5425\"> Kintanar</a>. In 2007, the workshop was reformatted to cater to &ldquo;mid-career&rdquo; writers to respond to the dearth in mentorship for writers who are in a latter stage of their careers. Thus, only those who have already published a book or who are about to publish their first book are eligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Influenced by the university&rsquo;s nationalist leaning, the conduct of the UP National Writers Workshop, including its theme, venue, orientation, and format, is seen as being more attuned to history, a counterpoint to Silliman&rsquo;s formalist tendencies (Ordo&ntilde;ez 1993, 215). The analyses often &ldquo;incline heavily towards all forms of Marxism&rdquo; (Bautista 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like UP&rsquo;s, the Ateneo Writers&rsquo; Workshop was also established in 1965 but lasted only until 1968, although the university had a workshop on writing in Pilipino in 1970. It was revived in 2001. UST held its first national writers&rsquo; workshop in 2000. It was discontinued in 2009 and revived in 2012 but limited to invited UST students. It became competitive and national in scope again in 2014. UP&rsquo;s Department of Filipino and Philippine Literature set up the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5554\">Palihang Rogelio Sicat</a> (Rogelio Sicat Workshop) in 2008 for works in Filipino and other Philippine languages with Filipino translations. Criticism workshops include UST&rsquo;s J. Elizalde Navarro National Workshop on Criticism and DLSU&rsquo;s Kritika National Workshop on Art and Cultural Criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For writers in the regional languages, workshops have long been a boon because of the dearth of other institutional support (Nadera 2007). The Cebuano Studies Center of the University of San Carlos in Cebu began the Cornelio Faigao Memorial Annual Writers Workshop in 1984 for works in Cebuano and English. Named after Faigao, who was then chairman of USC&rsquo;s English Department, it is the longest-running workshop that accepts work in a regional language. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5390\">Iligan National Writers Workshop</a> was set up in 1994 by the Mindanao State University&ndash;Iligan Institute of Technology. Explicitly geared to promote regional literature, it allocates slots to fellows from Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Works in Cebuano, Hiligaynon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2358\">Karay-a</a>, as well as in English and Filipino, are eligible for the IYAS Creative Writing Workshop, established in Bacolod City&rsquo;s University of St. La Salle in 2001. Other university-based workshops include UP Tacloban&rsquo;s Panagsugat All-Visayas Workshop, Ateneo de Zamboanga&rsquo;s Western Mindanao Writers Workshop, UP Clark&rsquo;s Kapampangan workshops, and UP Baguio&rsquo;s Cordillera Creative Writing Workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the apparent breadth and number of such activities, funding for writing workshops remains to be limited (Pernia 2002, 11). Even Silliman, which has achieved a measure of stature, &ldquo;constantly faces the threat of dissolution because of financial constraints.&rdquo; In 1990, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> withdrew its support of the workshop, forcing organizers to look for government and corporate sponsors. It &ldquo;returned&rdquo; to Silliman only in 2008. The 17th edition of the Iligan workshop did not get its usual funding from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, and fellows had to pay for their own transportation, board, and lodging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Over the decades, workshops have also been a major project of most literary organizations, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5314\">Galian sa Arte at Tula</a> on poetry; Katha on fiction; Telon Playwrights Circle on drama; Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas on the teaching of literature; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5558\">Pambansang Unyon ng mga Manunulat</a> on grassroots writing; and the Artista at Manunulat ng Sambayanan (Armas) on revolutionary literature. Campus organizations, like the UP Writers&rsquo; Club and Ateneo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5371\">Heights</a>, also hold annual workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Now a yearly five-month-long course, the poetry clinic of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5454\">Linangan sa Imahen, Retorika, at Anyo (LIRA)</a> traces its roots to the weekly critiquing session of a small group of young poets under the guidance of Virgilio S. Almario. Over the years, it has produced a roster of important writers in Filipino, including founding members <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5090\">Romulo P. Baquiran Jr</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5527\">Vim Nadera</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5048\">Teo Antonio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5697\">Luna Sicat</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5187\">Michael M. Coroza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5647\">Fidel Rillo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5049\">Rebecca A&ntilde;onuevo</a>. The LIRA clinic, which emphasizes &ldquo;a strong grounding in Filipino literary traditions&rdquo; before transitioning to more &ldquo;modern&rdquo; forms, conforms with the nativist poetics of Almario, who as workshop director emeritus continues to exert a strong influence on the clinic&rsquo;s conduct.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2008, the group started a nationwide outreach program called Sining ng Tugma at Sukat (later Pambansang Edukasyong Pampanitikan) for nonmembers. The two-day seminar for teachers and students also focus on &ldquo;native literary works and forms,&rdquo; with sessions on &ldquo;Sining ng Tugma at Sukat&rdquo; (Art of Rhyme and Meter) and &ldquo;Sining ng Talinghaga at Tayutay&rdquo; (Art of Metaphor and Figures of Speech).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Poetry group and alternative press <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5379\">High Chair</a> has also developed a poetry appreciation program called Compass, in which members visit school- and community-based writers&rsquo; groups and conduct discussions and workshops. The group Pinoypoets used the Internet as a venue to train members, mostly poets and poetry enthusiasts, with online writing exercises and workshops. The Lit Critters, a group of writers of speculative fiction, continues to hold workshops for members and prospective members alike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Regional organizations also conduct workshops, from those that are exclusive to members to others that are open to the public: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5363\">Gunglo Dagiti Mannurat nga Ilokano iti Filipinas Inc</a> and the Baguio Writers Group for writers from northern Luzon; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5413\">Kabulig-Bikol</a>, Parasurat Bikolnon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5039\">An Banwa: Kultura buda Arte kan Tabaco</a> for writers from Bicol; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5099\">Bathalan-ong Halad sa Dagang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5786\">Women in Literary Arts</a>, and Tarantula for writers in Cebuano; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5214\">Davao Writers&rsquo; Guild</a> for writers from Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">State cultural institutions also fund workshops. The NCCA has held workshops on regional writing, emergent literature, and women&rsquo;s writing. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, through its Coordinating Center for Literature, offers workshop and venue grants for literary organizations and institutions. For example, it was funding from the CCP that helped revive Western Visayas writing through workshops in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Cichon 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a result of all these activities, by the 1990s, &ldquo;young writing&rdquo; had become inseparable from universities (Lumbera 1995, 5). The decade saw, in addition to even more workshops, the establishment or reopening of more university-based creative writing centers and programs similar to UP&rsquo;s. These have provided writers with more &ldquo;institutional resources to undertake training and publication projects&rdquo; (Dalisay 2007, 8). These include the Ateneo Institute of Literary Arts and Practices, 2000; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5234\">De La Salle University Bienvenido N. Santos Creative Writing Center</a>, 1991; and the UST Center for Creative Writing and Literary Studies, 1999, reopened, 2012. Silliman University&rsquo;s Creative Writing Center was renamed the Edilberto K. Tiempo and Edith L. Tiempo Creative Writing Center in 2012 after Edith L. Tiempo&rsquo;s death the previous year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of these, Silliman has the oldest and longest-running creative writing program in the country, established by the Tiempos in 1951 as a possible area of concentration for English majors (Pernia 2002, 6). An MA was set up in 1960, which required attendance at the then-semestral writers&rsquo; workshop, a thesis in a student&rsquo;s chosen genre, and an examination. An MFA, described as &ldquo;a specialized degree program &hellip; intermediate between the usual MA and the doctor&rsquo;s degree,&rdquo; was briefly offered in 1972 before being canceled owing to the lack of enrollees (49). It currently has a PhD program under which students may submit a creative work with a critical introduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other schools followed suit. In UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, communication arts students can specialize in creative writing. UP Mindanao&rsquo;s program, set up in 1995, is the only one of its kind in Mindanao. DLSU offers an MFA and a DFA, while Ateneo offers a BFA. UST, whose literature students can take creative writing electives, revived its MA program in 2012. Far Eastern University, Miriam College, and the University of San Carlos offer creative writing electives, but these do not lead to an academic degree. Starting in 1992, students at the state-funded Philippine High School for the Arts in Los Ba&ntilde;os can major in creative writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This increase in creative writing programs, especially at the graduate level, mirrors a similar boom in postwar United States. In America, this surge is said to have had the most impact on postwar American literary production. It forged new roles for writers, turning &ldquo;[older] writers into salaried writing professors and students into tuition-paying apprentices&rdquo; (McGurl 2009, 4). As proof of the programs&rsquo; positive contribution, proponents point to the &ldquo;surfeit of literary excellence,&rdquo; the &ldquo;system-wide rise&rdquo; in the quality of American literature after World War II (410). In the Philippines, the relevance and efficacy of creative writing programs&mdash;and the workshop structure at their pedagogical core&mdash;have similarly been defended, often by the argument that training programs in other arts, such as in music and dance, are rarely, if at all, questioned (Dalisay 2013). Meanwhile, in the United States, critics have argued that the phenomenon has homogenized writing, with students coming up mostly with the &ldquo;workshop story&rdquo; or &ldquo;McPoem&rdquo; (Earnshaw 2007, 20). The New Critical emphasis on aesthetics and aversion to &ldquo;extra-literary&rdquo; ideas have also been criticized as simplistic and naive. The ideological underside of creative writing programs during the Cold War has also been up for scrutiny (Bennett 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the end, the full impact of training activities on the country&rsquo;s literary landscape cannot be fully ascertained by any statistical data, although the achievements of writers who participate in workshops, undergo informal tutelages, and enroll in creative writing programs can be seen as products of these modes of training. Their effects are more &ldquo;cumulative, rather than periodic &hellip; the effervescence evident in the writing scene&rdquo; (Bautista 1998). While literary training platforms can be manipulated to be conduits of self-serving politics and ideology, at their best, they can help &ldquo;inaugurate &hellip; the sensitivity, the imagination, and the craftsmanship&rdquo; necessary in the writers&rsquo; continued practice of their vocation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5094\">Joi Barrios</a>,</strong> </em><em><strong>updated by Glenn Diaz, with notes from Phillip Kimpo Jr,</strong> </em><em><strong>Mabi David, and John Bengan</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Almario, Virgilio S. 1991. <em>Taludtod at Talinghaga</em>.

It was also in this book that the term <b>ladino</b> was first used to refer to poems in both Spanish and <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, and to poets writing in this manner. The first verses written by Filipinos using the romance are attributed to Fernando Bagongbanta and the anonymous author of the poem &#x201C;May Bagyo Ma&#x2019;t May Rilim&#x201D; (Though It is Stormy and Dark). During the 18th century, Tondo became known as a center for poets. <a href=\"/9/9/5228\">Jose de la Cruz</a>, considered to be the best among them, is said to have taught himself philosophy and canon law. He became the teacher of many aspiring poets, such as <a href=\"/9/9/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a> aka Balagtas, Ananias Zorilla, Tomas Ledo, and the brothers Juan and Prudencio Feliciano. De la Cruz reputedly charged a <i>sisiw</i> (chick) for lessons, thus earning the epithet &#x201C;Huseng Sisiw.&#x201D; De la Cruz wrote poems at the request of young men courting women, and he scripted dramas commissioned by committees for town fiestas.

When a work is adapted, it is modified to fit into certain conditions or conventions different from those in which it originally appears. Settings, for example, may be localized; and plots, rearranged, condensed, or extended to appeal to a target audience. Generally, translation is a matter of language; adaptation, of form. Thus, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5172\">Gerardo Chanco</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sa Gitna ng Lusak</i></b> (Wallowing in Mud), 1918, would be a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> translation of the Spanish version of Alexandre Dumas&rsquo;s <b><i>Camille</i></b>, 1882; Cora Ifugo&rsquo;s <b><i>Lisa</i></b>, being made for dance, would be an adaptation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippine experience, however, translations and adaptations are not always separate. Ruperto S. Cristobal&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang</i></b><i> <b>Bulaklak sa Kabaret</b></i> (The Flower in the Cabaret), 1920, for example, is both a translation into Filipino and, with its Filipinized setting, an adaptation of Dumas&rsquo;s novel. Moreover, a translation may be more than one step away from its source. For instance, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5745\">Joaquin Tuason</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Bagong Robinson, Historiang Nagtuturo nang Mabuting Caugalian, na Ginauang Tanungan</i></b> (The New Robinson, Story That Teaches Good Conduct, Done in Primer Form), 1879, is a Tagalog translation of a Spanish translation of a German adaptation of the English novel <b><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></b>, 1719, by Daniel Defoe.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Translation and adaptation are done for various purposes. They may be done to aid proselytizing and moral edification. The Philippine Bible Society, the Translator&rsquo;s Association of the Philippines, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics, for instance, have translated the Bible into different Philippine languages&mdash;Tagalog, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>&mdash;to evangelize rural and tribal communities. Bible translation has come hand in hand with literacy projects in which indigenous folklore has been translated or adapted.<b> </b>Other translations or adaptations are done to foster nationalism or spread political propaganda. During the 19th century, translations of revolutionary literature, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;El Amor Patrio&rdquo; (Love of Country), 1882, helped to spur the local folks to overthrow the Spanish colonial government. The contents of these translations advocate the love of freedom and forward a strong nationalist sentiment. Some translations or adaptations serve to heighten one&rsquo;s consciousness of other cultures, to explore one&rsquo;s own culture, and to exhibit it to foreign audiences. <b><i>Mga Piling Akda buhat sa Panitikang </i></b></span><b><i>Aleman</i></b> (Selected Works from German Literature), 1970, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5506\">B. S. Medina</a> makes German literature available to non-German readers. Conversely, <b><i>Hiligaynon Literature: Texts and Contexts</i></b>, 1992, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5385\">Lucila Hosillos</a>, and <b><i>Gaddang Literature</i></b>, 1984, edited by Ma. Luisa Lumicao-Lora, allow foreign readers to enjoy local literatures. Translation societies pursue the twin tasks of preserving national literature and conscienticizing local and foreign audience by translating works from the different local languages. Translations may also have pedagogical purposes. The translation of children&rsquo;s literature has been driven by educational policy to promote the national language, and to implement mother tongue instruction in the initial grades, and likewise by the business prospects of instructional materials development. Still other translations or adaptations, especially those of the Western classics during the early decades of American rule, serve as literary models. Local writers received pointers in writing and in experimenting with form. Other translations function primarily to provide entertainment, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5075\">N. B. Bacalso</a>&rsquo;s translation of <b><i>Captain Blood</i></b> and of the comics series <b><i>Siegfred</i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3020\">Piux Kabahar</a>&rsquo;s translation of <b><i>Bertoldo, Bartolino y Cacaseno</i></b> (Bertoldo, Bartolino, and Cacaseno) by Giulio Cesare della Croce.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The history of translation in the Philippines actually predates the colonial era. Centuries before the coming of the Spaniards, Southeast Asia, being located between India and China was at the nexus of trade with China, India, the Mediterranean and Eurasia. Trade cities developed quickly where Arabic, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese were spoken, but where Malay was the lingua franca (Reid 2000, 23). Malay became an important source language in which hundreds of Malay words passed on to Tagalog. The region, the Philippines included, was thus fertile ground for translational exchange, although not in the form of published texts. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1551\">Folk literature</a> in various versions circulated especially in the borderless seas of maritime Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"spanish\" name=\"spanish\"></a>Spanish Colonial Period</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The desire of the Spanish colonizers, who began to arrive in the islands in the 16th century, to Christianize the natives led to the translation of many religious texts into the local tongues. To do this, missionaries learned the local languages first and codified these in <b>artes</b> (grammar books) and <b>vocabularios</b> (dictionaries). Then, the friars used their printing presses to publish the translations of European religious literature from the 16th to the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first product of these presses was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1600\"><b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola y Tagala</i></b></a> (Christian Doctrine in the Spanish and Tagalog Languages), 1593, by Fr Domingo de Nieva, in which the original Spanish text appeared first, followed by the Tagalog text in Roman alphabet and a translation in the <i>baybayin</i>, the local syllabary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some other translations of catechisms, or books that expound on Catholic doctrines and guide believers in such practices as praying and confessing, were Fr Francisco Blancas de San Jose&rsquo;s <b><i>Memorial de la Vida Christiana en Lengua Tagala</i></b> (Guidelines for the Christian Life in the Tagalog Language), 1605, which was translated into Chinese as <b><i>Memorial de la Vida Christiana en Lengua China</i></b> (Guidelines for the Christian Life in the Chinese Language) in 1605, and <b><i>Librong Pinagpapalamnan Yto nang Aalisin nang Tauong Christiano sa Pagcoconfesar at sa Pagcocomulgar</i></b> (Book Containing the Things That Should Be Removed by Confession and Communion), 1608; <b><i>Explicacion de la Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Tagala </i></b>(Explication of the Christian Doctrine in the Tagalog Language), 1628, by Fr Alonso de Santa Ana; and <b><i>Mga Aral na Mahal </i></b>(Sacred Lessons) by Fr Pedro Lopez, based on Fr Juan Eusebio&rsquo;s <b><i>Practica del Catecismo Romano</i></b> (Practice of the Roman Catechism).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the catechisms translated later were <b><i>Catecismo na Pinagpapalamnan nang manga Pangadyi at Maicling Casaysayan na Dapat Pagaralan ng Tauong Cristiano</i></b> (Catechism Containing Prayers and Short Narratives That Should Be Studied by Christians), 1868, by Fr Luis de Amesquita, based on the original by Geronimo Ripalda; <b><i>Pagpapaonaua na Parang Tanongan sa Caocolang Dapat na Gagawin nang manga Batang Bagong Magcocompisal</i></b> (Catechism on the Prerequisites to Be Fulfilled by Youths before Confession), based on a Spanish original by Fr Miguel de la Madre de Dios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other religious materials, such as prayer books, meditations, and novenas, were also translated. Among them were <b><i>Meditaciones, cun manga Mahal na Pagninilay na Sadia sa Santong Pag Eexercicios</i></b> (Meditations, or Holy Reflections Proper to the Spiritual Exercises), 1645, by Fr Pedro de Herrera, based on the Spanish <b><i>Meditaciones</i></b>, a retreat manual by Fr Francisco de Salazar; <b><i>Manga Panalanging Pagtatagobilin sa Caloloua nang Tauong Naghihingalo </i></b>(Prayers of Commendation for the Soul of the Dying), 1760, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5056\">Gaspar Aquino de Belen</a>, based on Thomas de Villacastin&rsquo;s <b><i>Recomendacion de las Almas</i></b>, in turn a translation of <b><i>Ordo Commendationis Animarum</i></b>; and <b><i>Pagsisiyam at Maicling Casaysayan Ucol sa Larauang Mapaghimala nang Mahal na Virgen nang Capayapaan at Mabuting Paglalayag, at nang manga Cababalaghang Gaua Niya, na Sinasamba sa Bayan ng <strong>Antipolo</strong></i></b> (Novenas and Short Narratives about the Miraculous Portrait of the Blessed Virgin of Peace and Good Voyage and Miracles Made by Her, Who is Worshipped by the Townspeople of Antipolo), 1835, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5594\">Mariano Pilapil</a>, based on a Spanish original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest translations of prose narratives arose with the evangelical zeal of the Spanish missionaries. Works that expound on proper social behavior or holiness within a minimal narrative frame, generally called conduct books, were translated. <b><i>Aral na Tunay na Totoong Pagaacay sa Tauo nang manga Cabanalang Gaua nang manga Maloualhating Santos na si Barlaan at ni Josaphat </i></b>(Actual Lesson in Guiding People to Truth Based on the Holy Works of the Glorious Saints Barlaan and Josaphat), 1712, one of the earliest of its kind, is a translation by Fr Antonio de Borja of Jacobo Biblio&rsquo;s Latin translation of a Greek version by San Juan Damasceno of the legend of Barlaan and Josaphat. During the European Renaissance, this tale was used by Spanish writers, such as Lope de Vega, who wrote the play <b><i>Barlaan y Josafat</i></b>, 1618. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5745\">Joaquin Tuason</a> translated another work with the same didactic intent: <b><i>Ang Bagong Robinson</i></b>, 1879.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Similarly, <b>vidas</b>, or biographies of saints, explain tenets of the Catholic religion through narrative. The lives of saints served as examples for the Filipino converts. Examples of vidas translated into the local languages include Roman de los Reyes&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Sagrada Familia o Ang Buhay nang Mag Ina ni Jesus na Tumubos sa Atin</i></b> (The Holy Family or the Life of the Mother and Her Son Jesus Who Has Redeemed Us), 1892, based on an excerpt from a book by Arcoiriz de Paz; Joaquin Tuason&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang manga Carangalan ni Maria</i></b> (The Honors of Mary), 1878, based on the Spanish translation of an Italian original; <b><i>Casaysayan nang manga Cababalaghan at <strong>Milagros</strong> na Guinaua nang Mahal na Virgen del Rosario na Sinasamba sa Capilla nang manga Pareng Dominico</i></b> (Account of the Marvels and Miracles Made by the Blessed Virgin of the Rosary, Who is Venerated at the Chapel of the Dominican Priests) by Vicente Garcia; <b><i>Buhay ni Santa Rita de Casia</i></b> (Life of Saint Rita of Casia), 1895, by Fr Raimundo Cortazar, who appended a novena and prayers for the saint; and <b><i>Buhay ni Santa Margarita de Cortona</i></b> (Life of Saint Margaret de Cortona), 1888, by Joaquin Tuason, based on Luz de Menestral by Francisco Buina.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Adaptations of stories from the Bible and the Apocrypha were also done. Like the vidas, these give concrete insights into the lives of the faithful. Examples include <b><i>Masamyong Bulaclac sa Jardin ni Jesucristo</i></b> (Fragrant Flower in the Garden of Jesus Christ), by Lucio Caraan, which depicts the life of Jesus Christ, and <b><i>Libro nang Martir sa Golgota</i></b> (Book of the Martyr of Golgotha), 1886, by Juan Evangelista. Evangelista&rsquo;s account of the life of Jesus is a translation of Enrique de Perez Escrich&rsquo;s two-volume Spanish novel <b><i>El Martir del Golgota: Tradiciones de Oriente </i></b>(The Martyr of Golgotha: Traditions of the Orient), 1863. Joaquin Tuason&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Malacas na Samson na Nagligtas sa manga Israelitas sa Caalipinan sa manga Filisteo</i></b> (The Strong Samson Who Saved the Israelites from Slavery under the Philistines), 1879, is a retelling of the life of Samson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Translation of prose narratives of the religious sort did not cease to be made after the Spanish period. In the 20th century, Epifanio Alfafara translated Jose Palles&rsquo;s <b><i>La Pasion del Redentor into Cebuano as Kasakitan sa Manunubos</i></b> (The Sufferings of the Redeemer), and Elpidio Fegi translated <b><i>Martir sa Golgota</i></b> from Tagalog into Cebuano. Although they were not consciously translated to proselytize, as the conduct books had been, these translations reinforced the religious&mdash;specifically, Catholic&mdash;orientation of the local folks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In translations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, the religious impulse was equally strong, and in the case of the <b>ladino</b> poets, this was coupled with a pedagogic intent. This group of native poets was knowledgeable in both Tagalog and Spanish, and they wrote bilingual verses, which were popular in the 17th century. In their poems, a line in one language would be followed by its equivalent in the other language, one line explaining the other, as in Fernando Bagonbanta&rsquo;s poem, an excerpt of which goes thus (Lumbera 1986, 240-41): </span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">Salamat nang ualang hangga</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\"><i>gracias se den sempiternas</i>,<i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">sa nagpasilang nang tala</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\"><i>al que hizo salir la estrella; </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">macapagpanao ang dilim</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\"><i>que destierre las tinieblas </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">sa lahat na bayan natin</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\"><i>de toda esta nuestra tierra</i>.<i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">(Undying gratitude is due</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">to the one who caused the star to rise</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">and dissipate the darkness</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"bodytext-poetry\" style=\"margin:0in 0.25in 0.0001pt\">everywhere in this, our land.)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Poems of this sort were meant to teach Spanish, but because of metrical constraints, the ladino&rsquo;s translations were not always exact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the most famous ladino were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5598\">Tomas Pinpin</a>, whose Tagalog translations of Spanish songs were collected in <b><i>Librong Pagaaralan nang manga Tagalog nang Uicang Castila</i></b> (A Book for the Tagalog to Study the Spanish Language), 1610, and Fernando Bagongbanta, whose Salamat nang Ualang Hangga&rdquo; (Undying Gratitude) appeared in <b><i>Memorial de la Vida Christiana en Lengua Tagala</i></b>, 1605.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 18th century saw the composition of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a>, or verse narratives recounting Christ&rsquo;s life and sufferings. These were later translated from the Tagalog to other local languages. Gaspar Aquino de Belen&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1898\"><b><i>Mahal na Passion ni Jesu Christong Panginoon Natin na Tola</i></b></a> (Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Verse), 1704, became the model of other pasyon to come in the different languages in the archipelago. It was translated into Cebuano as <b><i>Pasion sa Atong Guinoong Jesuchristo</i></b> (Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">A more popular pasyon is <b><i>Casaysayan nang Pasiong Mahal ni Jesucristong Panginoon Natin na Sucat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Sinomang Babasa</i></b> (The Story of the Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ That Should Inflame the Heart of the Reader), 1814, commonly known as <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong>Pasyon</strong></a></strong></i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><b><i>g <strong>Genesis</strong></i></b></a> (The Passion of Genesis) or <b><i>Pasyong Pilapil </i></b>(The Passion by Pilapil). This pasyon has been translated into Pangasinan as <b><i>Pasion na Cataoan tin Jesucristo</i></b>, 1855; into Bikol as <b><i>Casaysayan can Mahal na Pasion ni Jesucristo Cagurangnanta</i></b>, 1867; into Kapampangan as <b><i>Bienang Queralandalanan ning Guinutang Jesucristo</i></b>, 1876; into Ilocano as <b><i>Biag da Apotayo Jesu, Maria quen Jose</i></b>, 1889; and into Ilonggo as <b><i>Quinabuhi cag Pasion ni Jesucristo nga Aton Guinoo</i></b>, 1892.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although the bulk of the prose and poetry translated during the Spanish period was religious, translations of secular prose also existed and flourished during the 19th century. An emergent Filipino middle class created a demand for translations of such works, and opportunities for publishing were opening up with the establishment of commercial printing presses in Manila, such as the Imprenta de Amigos de Pais, then available to the wealthy, literate members of the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1800s, translation of secular prose narratives works slowly caught up with translations of religious materials. Such were Jose Rizal&rsquo;s translation of five of Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s stories for children and Hermenegildo Flores&rsquo;s translation of Antonio de Trueba&rsquo;s <b><i>El Angel y el Diablo</i></b> into Filipino as <b><i>Ang Anghel at ang Diablo</i></b> (The Angel and the Devil), 1882, which appeared in <b><i>Diariong Tagalog</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In poetry, side by side with the pedagogical and religious translations made by the ladino were translations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>: the <b>awit</b> and the <b>korido</b>. Although they indirectly espoused religious values, especially in their depiction of conflicts between Muslims and Christians, metrical romances were more escapist than edifying. European romances had been translated into local languages by Spanish missionaries as early as the late 1500s. Later, local writers translated and adapted such romances as the Charlemagne cycles, the Arthurian cycles, and the myths of Greece, often localizing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Examples of the awit and korido are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1864\"><b><i>Salita at Buhay ng Doce Pares sa Francia</i></b></a> (Story and Life of the Twelve Pairs of France), a retelling of <b><i>Historia del Emperador Carlo Magno</i></b> (History of Emperor Charlemagne); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5228\">Jose de la Cruz</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1849\"><b><i>Ang Walang Pagkupas na Kasaysayan ni <strong>Bernardo Carpio</strong></i></b></a> (The Unfading Story of Bernardo Carpio), which combines episodes from <b><i>Las Mocedades de Bernardo del Carpio</i></b>, a play by Lope de Vega, and the <b><i>Primera Cronica General</i></b>; and <b><i>Salita at Buhay ni Roberto el Diablo Anac nang Duque de Normandia at sa Huli Tinauag na Tauo nang Dios</i></b> (Story and Life of Robert the Devil, Son of the Duke of Normandy and Later Called the Man of God), an adaptation of <b><i>La Espantosa y Maravillosa Vida de Roberto el Diablo</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Whereas the translation of religious writings might have served a colonialist purpose, the translation of secular prose often had an opposite function. The rise of translations of nationalistic works in the 1800s paralleled the growing sense of discontent with Spanish rule. Wealthy Filipinos, educated in Europe and exposed to liberal ideas, clamored for reforms; poor Filipinos, weary of oppression, were calling for revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Discursive writings that helped to animate the nationalist spirit include Jose Rizal&rsquo;s translation of <b><i>The Rights of Man</i></b>, 1789, into Tagalog as <b><i>Ang mga Karapatan ng Tao</i></b>, 1891, which circulated in Manila in pamphlet form; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>&rsquo;s translation of Rizal&rsquo;s essay &ldquo;El Amor Patrio&rdquo; (Patriotism) into Tagalog, which appeared together with the original Spanish text in <b><i>Diariong Tagalog</i></b> on 22 Aug 1882.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pasyon itself, in one instance at least, became possessed by the revolutionary spirit. Hitherto used for edification, it became a site for propaganda when Marcelo H. del Pilar adapted the <b><i><strong>Pasyong Genesis</strong></i></b> into &ldquo;Pasyong Dapat Ipag-alab nang Puso nang Tauong Baba sa Kalupitan nang Fraile&rdquo; (Passion That Should Inflame the Heart of the Person Who Suffers the Cruelty of the Friars), 1888. It was an attack on the Spanish clergy in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>The American Colonial Period and the Japanese Occupation</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American colonial period, translation driven by nationalism continued. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>El Verdadero Decalogo</i></b> (The True Decalogue) was translated into Tagalog as <b><i>Ang Sampung Aral ni Mabini</i></b> (The Decalogue of Mabini), 1921, by Albino Dimayuga from the Spanish. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5416\">Teodoro M. Kalaw </a>translated his own memoirs titled <b><i><strong>La Revolucion Filipina</strong></i> </b>from Spanish to English as <b><i>The Philippine Revolution</i></b>, 1925, which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio S. Almario</a> would later translate into Filipino as <b><i>Ang Himagsikang Filipino</i></b>, 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rizal was an obvious instrument of nationalism, his works periodically translated throughout the 20th century and beyond. Enjoying the most popularity with translators of Philippine poems is his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\">&ldquo;Mi Ultimo Adios&rdquo;</a> (My Last Farewell). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a> translated the poem into Tagalog in 1896 as &ldquo;Pahimakas&rdquo; (Farewell). It was later translated into Tagalog by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5630\">I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado</a> as &ldquo;Ang Aking Pahimakas&rdquo; (My Farewell), 1911; other Tagalog translations are by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5694\">Jose Sevilla</a>, by Jose Gatmaitan, and by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4378\">Vicente de Jesus</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3139\">Mariano Proceso Byron Pabalan</a> translated it into Kapampangan, and at least 15 Cebuano versions of the same poem exist. &ldquo;Mi Ultimo Adios&rdquo; has also been rendered into Ilonggo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a>, and Ilocano. English translations have been made by Charles Derbyshire and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>. Versions of the poem in Indonesian, Malaysian, Chinese, Japanese, and Bengali exist, as do translations in French, German, Italian, Hungarian, Swedish, and Latin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Almost as popular among translators, and eventually used as a weapon against Americanism, is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>, aka Balagtas. His farce <b><i>La India Elegante y el Negrito Amante</i></b> (The Elegant Native Woman and Her Aeta Suitor), ca. 1860, has an Ilocano translation by Efraim Fa. Ordinaria, published in <b><i>Ilocos Times</i></b>. Balagtas is better known, however, for <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></a></strong> </i></b> (Florante and Laura), 1838, a metrical romance often interpreted as an allegory of national struggle. It has been repeatedly translated into Pangasinan and Ilocano. A Kapampangan version was done by Francisco Xavier Panlilio; a Cebuano version, by Adela del Rosario; a Bikol version, by Pelagio Guamil; and an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a> version, by Buenaventura Mirafuente. Balagtas&rsquo;s romance was novelized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5774\\\\\">P. R. Villanueva</a> in 1949.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Translations of <b><i>Florante at Laura</i></b> into foreign languages have also been made. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5238\">Epifanio de los Santos</a> and Felix Ferrer, on separate occasions, translated it into Spanish. Jose Rizal, Teodoro M. Kalaw, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5557\">Rafael Palma</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5117\">Manuel Bernabe</a> all did versions of the romance in Spanish. English translations were made by George St. Clair, Arsenia Yap, Adela E. del Rosario, and, as collaborators, Jose P. Villarica and Marcela Dayao Villarica. Rizal made a German version of <b><i>Florante at Laura</i></b>, as did Pablo Laslo and Otto von Scheerer. Madame Angela de la Cantera wrote a French version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Balagtas&rsquo;s works would be influential in the development of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1536\">Philippine literature</a>, especially the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a>, which would follow them in using courtly love and complicated family relations or in depicting themes of good versus evil through allegorical characters. More importantly, however, the Balagtas tradition became a disguised mouthpiece against Americanization in the first two decades of the 20th century. The Balagtas poets&rsquo; reaffirmation of the traditions of Christianity and the spirit of the propaganda and revolutionary movements was to them a patriotic stance. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1938\">Sa Dakong Silangan</a> </i></b>(In the East), 1928, is an example of anti-Americanism in the form of a romance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">In fiction, the choice of what was translated or adapted also hinted at nationalist inspiration. Among the authors frequently translated or adapted were 19th-century European writers Victor Hugo, Leo Tolstoy, and Alexandre Dumas, <i>p&egrave;re</i> and <i>fils</i>, whose works reveal social and political dimensions. Writers like Aurea Jimenez Santiago, Gerardo Chanco, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5067\">Narciso Asistio</a>, who read the European writers in Spanish translation, made them available to the Filipinos in the local languages. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hugo&rsquo;s works, which were laced with flowery images and melodramatic hyperboles, clearly exhibited his love of liberty and sympathy with the common folk. They were thus compatible with the nationalist spirit of the time. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5619\">Benigno Ramos</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ng Kalayaan</i></b> (Freedom&rsquo;s Offspring), 1926, is a translation of one of Hugo&rsquo;s plays. Gerardo Chanco translated <b><i>Les Miserables</i></b>, a novel about the wretched classes in French society, into <b><i>Sakit ng Sangkatauhan </i></b>(Sickness of the Human Race), 1921-23, as did Aurea Jimenez Santiago, who titled her translation <b><i>Si Jean Valjean, o, Ang mga Labi</i></b> (Jean Valjean or the Dregs), 1952. Santiago also translated <b><i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i></b> as <b><i>Ang Kuba sa Notre Dame</i></b>, 1952.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tolstoy, known for his altruism, his belief in liberalism, and his use of realism, was another favorite among Filipino translators. His masterpiece <b><i>Anna Karenina</i></b> was adapted by Narciso Asistio into <b><i>Natapos Na ang Lahat</i></b> (Everything is Ended), 1930, and <b><i>What Men Live By</i></b> was translated as <b><i>Sa Ano Nabubuhay ang Tao</i></b>, 1919, by Sofronio Calderon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Dumases, like Hugo, were known for their melodramas, but their works were nonetheless a favorite among reformists, such as Jose Rizal. Aurea Jimenez Santiago translated <b><i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i></b><i> </i>as <b><i>Ang Konde ng Monte Cristo</i></b> in 1952. Another work, <b><i>Amaury</i></b>, was translated by Gerardo Chanco in 1919 as <b><i>Amaury, o, Pumapatay at Bumubuhay</i></b> (Amaury or One Who Kills and Brings to Life).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rizal&rsquo;s<b> </b>two novels enjoyed a number of translations throughout the American colonial period. <b><i><strong> <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> (Touch Me Not), 1887, was translated into Tagalog by Sofronio Calderon in 1906, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5599\">Pascual Poblete</a> in 1909, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a> in 1912, and by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5330\">Pedro Gatmaitan</a> in 1926 (Testa de Ocampo 2011, 521); into Kapampangan by Pedro Manike in 1933; and into English by Charles Derbyshire, who gave it the title <b><i>Social Cancer</i></b>, 1912, and by Feliciano Basa and Francisco Benitez in 1933.

Filipino writers translated Western short stories that were not originally in English through reading English or Spanish translations. &ldquo;The Tell-Tale Heart&rdquo; by Edgar Allan Poe, from whom Filipino fictionists learned &ldquo;unity of effect&rdquo; and the classic dramatic arc, was translated by Pascual de Leon as &ldquo;Pusong Mapagsuplong,&rdquo; 1914, and by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5007\">Teodoro Agoncillo</a>&rsquo;s as &ldquo;Pitlag ng Puso,&rdquo; 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other translations of Western short stories during this time include &ldquo;Ang Tatlong Pag-ibig&rdquo; (The Three Loves), 1904, Gonzalo G.

Spanish novels were among the favorite sources of such translators as Rosendo Ignacio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5013\">Rosalia Aguinaldo</a>. Ignacio translated <b><i>Los Amantes de Teruel</i></b> (Lovers of Teruel) as <b><i>Ang Martir na Pag-ibig</i></b> (The Martyr to Love), 1923; and M. Ibo Alfaro&rsquo;s <b><i>Vivir es Amor</i></b> (To Live is to Love) as <b><i>Ang Buhay Ay Pag-ibig</i></b> (Life is Love), 1918.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other examples of translations of this sort include <b><i>Ang Pag-ibig na May Piring</i></b> (Blindfolded Love), 1929, by Rosalia Aguinaldo based on Salvador Farina&rsquo;s <b><i>Amor Vendado</i></b> (Peddler&rsquo;s Love); &ldquo;Huling Tanda ng Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Last Sign of Love), 1920, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5257\">Leonardo Dianzon</a>, based on a short story by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5083\">Jesus Balmori</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1930s, commercialism was to direct the production of many translations. This orientation was reinforced by <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\">Liwayway</a> </i></b>magazine and its sister publications <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5121\"><b><i>Bisaya</i></b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5087\"><b><i>Bannawag</i></b></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5383\"><b><i>Hiligaynon</i></b></a>. These published novels, stories, and poems revolving around love, betrayal, filial piety, and suffering. Foreign works translated or adapted into the local languages include those by Alexandre Dumas, Lew Wallace, Rafael Sabatini, Charles Dickens, and Victor Hugo, whose sprawling works met the public demand for serialized fiction containing much sentiment and plot convolutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Charles Dickens&rsquo;s <b><i>David Copperfield</i></b> was translated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5125\">Flaviano Boquecosa</a> into Cebuano as <b><i>Si David, ang Ilo</i></b> (David the Pitiful), 1935-36. The novel would influence Boquecosa&rsquo;s own output, especially his two novels: <b><i>Ang Palad ni Pepe</i></b> (The Fate of Pepe), 1937, and <b><i>Ang Anak ni Pepe</i></b> (The Child of Pepe), 1939. Boquecosa also translated <b><i>Jane Eyre</i></b>, 1947-48, and <b><i>Anna Karenina</i></b>, 1949-51. Dumas&rsquo;s <b><i>Camille</i></b> was translated by Gerardo Chanco as <b><i>Sa Gitna ng Lusak</i></b>, 1918, and adapted by Ruperto S. Cristobal as <b><i>Ang Bulaklak sa Kabaret</i></b> (The Flower in the Cabaret), 1920. Local novelists, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5313\">Fausto Galauran</a>, I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5032\">Rosauro Almario</a>, would draw from the Camille character. Their novels in turn would be translated into other local languages and serialized in magazines. Examples include <b><i>Ang</i></b> <b><i>Hatol ng Langit</i></b> (Heaven&rsquo;s Judgment) and <b><i>Ang Kamay ng Diyos</i></b> (The Hand of God).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Catering to the readers&rsquo; taste for love stories and bildungsroman, the magazines in the different local languages serialized Tagalog novels in translation. Translated into Cebuano were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5158\">Nemesio Caravana</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sanlibong Pisong Kagandahan</i></b> (Thousand-Peso Beauty) and <b><i>Bagong Manunubos</i></b> (New Redeemer); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5307\">Lazaro Francisco</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Sa Paanan ng Krus</i></b> (At the Foot of the Cross), 1935-36, <b><i>Pamana ng Isang Pulubi</i></b> (Legacy of a Beggar), 1936-37, and <b><i>Singsing na Pangkasal</i></b> (Wedding Ring), 1939-40; Fausto Galauran&rsquo;s <b><i>Lihim ng Kumpisalan</i></b> (Secret of the Confessional), 1939; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5442\">Adriano P. Laudico</a>&rsquo;s<b><i> Si Pamela: Ang Mutya ng <strong>Palengke</strong></i></b> (Pamela: The Muse of the Market).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The rise of t</span>he cinema further encouraged the translation of works for entertainment. Many works of adventure, suspense, and romance were translated and adapted. Some of the most famous ones include Flaviano Boquecosa&rsquo;s translations of Edgar Rice Burroughs&rsquo;s Tarzan series, made between 1933 and 1934: <b><i>Tarzan: Ang Tawong Unggoy</i></b> (Tarzan: The Ape Man), <b><i>Ang Pagbabalik ni Tarzan</i></b> (The Return of Tarzan), and <b><i>Ang mga Mananap ni Tarzan</i> </b>(The Beasts of Tarzan).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In poetry, classic works of Western literature, like the <b><i>Divine Comedy</i></b> by Dante and <b><i>Paradise Lost</i></b> by John Milton, were translated into the various Philippine languages. Rosendo Ignacio&rsquo;s prose paraphrase of <b><i>Divine Comedy</i></b> was titled <b><i>Ang Bathalang Dula</i></b>, 1917.<i> </i>Spanish poems were also translated: Julian Cruz Balmaseda translated Roman de Campoamor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cantares Amorosos&rdquo; (Amorous Songs) into Tagalog as &ldquo;Sa Aklat ng Pag-ibig&rdquo; (In the Book of Love), 1915; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5555\">Jose Palma</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mi Caida&rdquo; (My Downfall) as &ldquo;Pagkasawi Ko&rdquo; (When I Die), 1915.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">English Romantic poets, such as John Keats, Lord Byron, and Percy Bysshe Shelley, were often translated, especially by the <b>balagtasista</b>, or followers of Balagtas, such as Gerardo Chanco. Manuel Aguinaldo translated Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Footsteps of Angels&rdquo;; Benigno Ramos&rsquo;s &ldquo;Isang Tula ni Mutsihito&rdquo; (A Poem of Mutsihito), 1911, is a translation of a poem by Emperor Mutsihito of Japan; Benigno Ramos&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ipagsakdal&rdquo; (Accuse), 1920, is from a stanza of one of Ralph Waldo Emerson&rsquo;s poems. Maria Caballero&rsquo;s &ldquo;Talinghaga ng Pag-ibig&rdquo; (Metaphor of Love), 1923, is from Percy Bysshe Shelley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Love&rsquo;s Philosophy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, the <b><i>Pasyong Pilapil</i></b> was translated into other local languages during the first half of the 20th century. Pascual M. Diaz translated the pasyon into Waray in 1916 as <b><i>Casayuran nang Pasion nga Mahal ni Jesuchristo nga Guenoo Naton</i></b>, and Jacinto Bernal translated it into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Samal</a> in 1916 as <b><i>Pasion nan Catauan tamon Jesucristo sa Salita Sambali</i></b>. An Ibanag translation appeared in 1948, titled <b><i>Pasion nay Yatufam a Jesucristo Aquimallo tan Dios</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the Japanese government used translation to obtain the support of the Filipinos against the United States and to promote Japanese interests. Essays extolling Japanese benevolence and promising independence to the Philippines in the near future were rendered into the local languages or into English. Examples include Premier Tozjo&rsquo;s <b><i>Visit Brings the Philippines Closer to Independence</i></b>, 1943, and <b><i>Peace and Freedom</i></b>, translated into English, Filipino, Cebuano, Ilonggo, Tagalog, and Bikol. <b><i>One Nation, One Heart, One Republic</i></b>, 1943, by Jose Laurel, was likewise translated into Ilocano, Tagalog, Bikol, Spanish, Waray, and Cebuano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Books translated from the Japanese into English and Tagalog were <b><i>The Flowering of the Racial Spirit</i></b>, 1942, translated by Kazi-o Nisina; <b><i>Kautusang Panloob ng mga Manggagawa sa Arsenal </i></b>(Internal Rules for the Workers of the Arsenal) and <b><i>Nippon at Bushido</i></b> (Nippon and Bushido), 1943, translated by Gen Artemio Ricarte. A book that helped propagate the Japanese language was <b><i>Mga Salitaan sa Nippongo ukol sa mga Filipino</i></b> (Conversations in Nippongo about the Filipinos) by Swadi Kiyoshi, which featured typical conversations in Japanese for various occasions, with Tagalog translations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Newspapers and magazines produced under Japanese supervision carried propaganda and, to some extent, Nippongo lessons. Some newspapers were <b><i>La Vanguardia</i></b>, whose contents were mostly Spanish translations of <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">the news given out in the <b><i><strong>Tribu</strong>ne</i></b>; and<b> <i>Panay Times</i></b>, also known as <b><i>Panay Shu-ho</i></b>, published in English and Ilonggo. <b><i>Shin Seiki</i></b>, 1942-44, and <b><i>Ang Kapitbahay</i></b>, 1944, were magazines that featured articles in English and Tagalog. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A Tagalog translation of the <b><i>Noli</i></b>, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3802\">Guillermo E. Tolentino</a>, was published in 1944 and titled <b><i>Huwag Mo Akong Salingin</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"after\" name=\"after\"></a>After World War II</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rizal continued to be translated after World War II. Three Tagalog translations of the <b><i>Noli</i></b> appeared in 1950: by Bartolome del Valle and Benigno Zamora; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3230\">Dionisio S. Salazar</a>; and by Maria Odulio de Guzman, Domingo D. de Guzman, and Francisco Laksamana. At least two more Tagalog translations&mdash;one by Leonardo A. Dianzon, I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado, and Dionisio San Agustin, 1956, and another by Felisa de la Paz and Carmen B. Mallari, 1970&mdash;were made before the declaration of martial law (Testa-de Ocampo 2011, 522). Lourdes Bengson Ungson translated it into Pangasinan as <b><i>Agmoak Didiwiten</i></b> in 1958. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5546\">Camilo Osias</a> in 1956, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5123\">Jorge Bocobo</a> in 1956, Priscilla Valencia in 1967, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5762\">Jovita Ventura</a> in 1989 rendered the novel into English; but among the English translations, the most popular is <b><i>The Lost Eden</i></b>, 1961, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5349\">Leon Ma. Guerrero</a>. Madeline Lao Lim and She Fen, on separate occasions, translated the novel into Chinese. German and Japanese versions of the novel also exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Rosendo Ignacio translated the novel <b><i>El Filibusterismo </i></b>into Tagalog as <b><i>Ang Pagsusuwail</i></b> (The Rebellion), 1958; and Lourdes Bengson Ungson translated it into Pangasinan as <b><i>Say Isusungpad Uley</i></b>, 1964. Translations into Ilonggo, Ilocano, and Cebuano have also been made. English translations of <b><i>El Filibusterismo</i></b> from this period include <b><i>Greed</i></b>, 1951, by A. A. Tablan and A. T. Veloro, and <b><i>The Subversive</i></b>, 1965, by Leon Ma. Guerrero. Henry Yeh made a Chinese translation of the novel in 1960.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The impact of Rizal&rsquo;s two novels can be seen in the numerous adaptations made from them. Novels, from Florentino Suico&rsquo;s <b><i>Puthaw ug Dugo</i></b> (Iron and Blood), 1931, to the underground <b><i>Hulagpos</i></b> (Breaking Free), 1980, by Mana de Verdades Posadas (pseud.), contain motifs found in Rizal&rsquo;s works, as does the contemporary short story &ldquo;Ang Pinakahuling Kuwento ni Huli&rdquo; (The Final Story of Huli), 1989, by Lilia Quindoza-Santiago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.1pt\">Apart from Rizal, prose narratives continued to be translated after American rule and World War II. The campus paper <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3957\"><b><i>Dawn</i></b></a> published <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5487\">Rogelio Mangahas</a>&rsquo;s translation of <b><i>La Forma de la Espada</i></b> by Jorge Luis Borges and <b><i>Der Dichter</i></b> by Herman Hesse. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Translations of foreign short prose narratives were published as an appendix to manuals in short story writing, such as <b><i>Ang Sining ng Maikling Kwento</i></b> (The Art of the Short Story), 1957, by Mariano C. Pascual, which contains 10 short stories. In 1967, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5194\">Andres Cristobal Cruz</a> made a collection of German fiction translated into Filipino, titled <b><i>Paghahanap at Iba Pang Kwentong Aleman</i></b> (Searching and Other German Stories), 1967. The book in turn was translated into Ilocano as <b><i>Napili a Sarita Dagiti Aleman</i></b> (Selected Stories from German), 1970, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5378\">Juan S. P. Hidalgo</a>. <b><i>Talaarawan ng Isang Baliw</i></b> (Diary of a Madman) and <b><i>Ang Pulang Lampara</i></b> (The Red Lamp), both bearing a similar ideological slant, are translations from Lu Xun (Lu Hsun) and Mao Tse-tung, respectively. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5047\">Lilia F. Antonio</a> translated <b><i>The Little Prince</i></b> by Antoine de Saint-Exupery into <b><i>Ang Munting Prinsipe</i></b>, 1969.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from novels and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short stories</a>, folktales were another form of prose narrative continually translated. Before the establishment of the New Republic in 1946, Rizal had retold the legend of Mariang Makiling and the fable of the monkey and the turtle, Dean Fansler had collected his students&rsquo; retellings of Philippine folktales in <b><i>Filipino Popular Tales</i></b>, 1921, and one of Fansler&rsquo;s students, Lim Sian Tek, had introduced Chinese folktales in <b><i>Folk Tales from China</i></b>, 1926, and <b><i>More Folk Tales from China</i></b>, 1944.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Now in the 1950s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5621\">Maximo Ramos</a> published retellings of Philippine folklore in these books: <b><i>Tales of Long Ago in the Philippines</i></b>, 1953; <b><i>Philippine Myths and Tales for Young Readers</i></b>, 1957; <b><i>Creatures of Midnight</i></b>, 1967;<b> </b>and <b><i>Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology</i></b>, 1971. These books and other similar titles by Ramos would be republished in 1990 as a set titled <b><i>Realms of Myths and Reality</i></b>. Aesop&rsquo;s fables were adapted by Bartolome del Valle in<b> <i>Isinatulang mga Pabula ni Esopo</i></b><i> </i>(The Fables of Aesop Rendered in Verse), 1974. <b><i>Romance in Philippine Names</i></b>, 1979, contains retellings of native stories on the origins of place names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Samples of Philippine folklore were further translated in the 1980s in such books as <b><i>A Treasury of Mandaya and Mansaka Folk Literature</i></b>, 1980, which gathers the riddles, proverbs, songs, and tales from the Mindanao area and renders them in English;<b> <i>Cordillera Tales</i></b>, 1989, by Luisa Igloria (then writing as Maria Luisa B. Aguilar-Cari&ntilde;o), which retells stories from the Mountain Province; and <b><i>Mga Ginto sa Iloilo</i></b> (Gold Nuggets in Iloilo), 1990, by Felicisima Torres-Campos, which renders tales from Ilonggo into Filipino. Susie L. Tan&rsquo;s two volumes of <b><i>Tales for Big Children</i></b>, 1995, retell Chinese and Filipino folk literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In poetry, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5562\">Jose Villa Panganiban</a> made Japanese poetry accessible by translating a sample in <b><i>Tanaga, Haiku, Pantun</i></b>, 1963. About two decades earlier, Emilio Aguinaldo had translated haikus in <b><i>El Renacimiento</i></b>. The <b><i>Rubaiyat</i> <i>of Omar Khayyam</i></b> was translated into Filipino by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5687\">Ildefonso Santos</a> in 1952, based on Edward Fitzgerald&rsquo;s English version, and by Rufino Alejandro in 1972. During the 1950s, the works of some Filipino poets, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a> and Jose Corazon de Jesus, were rendered into Chinese in <b><i>W&eacute;nli&aacute;n Z&aacute;zh&igrave;</i></b> (Literary Art Magazine) by members of the Philippine-Chinese Literary Workers&rsquo; Union.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Translations of foreign poems found their way into the collections of well-known poets, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5372\">Amado V. Hernandez</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1882\"><strong>Isang Dipang Langit</strong></a></i></b> (A Stretch of Sky), 1961. The leading translator of this period, however, was the trilingual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5282\">Federico Licsi Espino Jr</a>, whose works include <b><i>Sa Paanan ng Parnaso </i></b>(At the Foot of Parnassus), 1965, and <b><i>Toreng Bato, Kastilyong Pawid</i></b> (Stone Tower, Castle of Palm Leaves), 1966. Licsi Espino translated poets from England, America, Poland, Russia, and Czechoslovakia in <b><i>Kudyaping Banyaga</i></b> (Foreign Lyre), 1966, with Rufino Alejandro; <b><i>Balalayka ni Pasternak</i></b> (Balalaika of Pasternak), 1967; and <b><i>Makabagong Panulaan</i></b> (Modern Poetry), 1974. Espino also translated his own Spanish poems into English in <b><i>Bird in the Lyric Cage</i></b>, 1970.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The works of the modernist poets such as T. S. Eliot, Arthur Rimbaud, Charles Baudelaire, Ezra Pound, Federico Garcia Lorca, Salvatore Quasimodo, Wallace Stevens, Robert Frost, and Pablo Neruda were popular among translators in Philippine colleges. Most of these translations appeared in campus journals and newspapers. Rogelio Mangahas, Virgilio S. Almario, and Licsi Espino were among the most active translators. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a> made a Filipino translation of T. S. Eliot&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Waste Land.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, the modernists were not the only poets translated. Translation production increased markedly during the martial law era in the 1970s, spurred by protests of nationalist and anti-imperialist movements against the dictator. The turbulent times of the Marcos years (1965-86) produced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1885\"><b><i>Kamao</i></b></a> (Fist), 1971, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>, a collection of protest poems by Mao Tse-tung, Bertolt Brecht, Che Guevarra, Pablo Neruda, Otto Rene Castillo, and other progressive poets, translated from English into Filipino. An interest in Third World literature is indicated by the Filipino translations of Licsi Espino&rsquo;s <b><i>Mga Tulang Afro-Asyatiko</i></b> (Afro-Asian Poems), 1975, and <b><i>Ang Panulaan ng Afrika at Timog-Silangang Asya</i></b> (The Poetry of Africa and Southeast Asia), 1981, with co-translator Paula Espino.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Just as Marcelo H. del Pilar had adapted the pasyon to expose the abuses of friars, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5655\">Francisco &ldquo;Soc&rdquo; Rodrigo</a> adapted the pasyon to criticize martial law in <b><i>Pasyon sa Kamatayan ng Ating Kalayaan</i></b> (Passion on the Death of Our Freedom), 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Translations of prose works aimed at heightening the political consciousness of the Filipinos continued to be produced in the 1970s.

The first was the launch of the Panitikan series in 1986 by a consortium of the University of the Philippines Press, the Ateneo de Manila University Press, and the De La Salle University Press. The second was the alignment of cultural institutions in promoting regional literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Panitikan series made Philippine works in the different local languages available to modern readers. Works written in local languages were reprinted in the original with an accompanying translation into English or Filipino or both. The primary purpose for the Panitikan series was to translate works from various regional literatures into Filipino so these would become part of a national literature. The series was sustained till the 1990s. A total of 36 works from the various regional languages were translated into Filipino, among which were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5312\">Zoilo Galang</a>&rsquo;s Kapampangan novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1721\"><strong>Ing Capalaran</strong></a></i></b> (Fate), 1923, translated by Lourdes H.

It devoted issues to regional literature with translations of the works: Cebuano in 1987, Ilocano in 1988, and Hiligaynon in 1989. In the 1990s, the practice continued, with literature from Samar, Mindanao, Cordillera, Bikol, Pangasinan, and Aklan. Apart from <b><i>Ani</i></b>, the CCP<b><i> </i></b>published <b><i>Handurawan</i></b> (Ideals), 1990, a trilingual anthology of poems by winners of the CCP literature grants for poetry, 1988-89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside of these institutions, there were other efforts, individual or institutional, to translate regional literature.

These books would be supplemented 30 years later with the publication of <b><i>Cebuano Fiction / Sugilanong Sugboanon: Until 1940</i> </b>and <b><i>Cebuano Fiction / Sugilanong Sugboanon: 1941-2005</i></b>, 2009, both books the product of the same team behind <b><i>Cebuano Poetry</i></b>. Kapampangan literature was translated in at least three volumes: <b><i>Kapampangan Literature: A <strong>Historical</strong> Survey and Anthology</i></b>, 1981, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5490\">Edna Zapanta Manlapaz</a>; <b><i>Literature of the Pampangos</i></b>, 1981, edited by Rosalina Ichban-Castro; and <b><i>Kapampangan Writing: A Selected Compendium and Critique</i></b>, 1984, by Evangelina Hilario-Lacson.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mamitua Saber and Sr Delia Coronel, ICM, supervised the multivolume translation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> epic <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></i></b>, 1983-86. The Committee on Culture and Information of the ASEAN produced <b><i>Epics of the Philippines</i></b>, 1984, which contains five Philippine epics in English translation&mdash;<b><i>Aliguyon</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a></i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></a></i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1831\"><b><i>Agyu</i></b></a>, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1940\"><strong>Sandayo</strong></a></i></b>&mdash;and <b><i>Philippine <strong>Metrical Romance</strong>s</i></b>, 1985, with translations of <b><i>Bernardo Carpio</i></b>, <b><i>Juan Te&ntilde;oso</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1880\">Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></a> </i></b>(Adarna Bird), <b><i>Florante at Laura</i></b>, and <b><i>Abdulla and Patli Isara</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A third development may be mentioned. The Solidarity Translation Series, funded by the Toyota Foundation and published by the Solidarity Publishing House, was begun in 1987. While institutional efforts to translate works in the Philippine local languages into Filipino to develop a national language and literature were vigorous, the translation of Asian literature was limited in comparison. The Solidarity Translation Series rendered Japanese and Southeast Asian titles into Filipino. The source texts were mostly English translations of Southeast Asian works, although a number of translators worked directly with the foreign language texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The series came up with 63 titles between 1987 and 1994 (Zafra 2004). Among these are <b><i>Si Taw at Iba Pang Kuwentong Thai</i></b> (Taw and Other Thai Stories), 1988, translated from an English translation by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>; Oe Kenzaburo&rsquo;s <b><i>Isang Personal na Bagay</i> </b>(A Personal Matter), a translation into Filipino by Rogelio Mangahas of John Nathan&rsquo;s translation in English from the original Japanese <b><i>Kojinteki na Taiken</i></b>, 1992; <b><i>Mga Kuwentong Bayan mula sa Vietnam</i></b> (Folktales from Vietnam), 1992,<i> </i>translated from English into Filipino by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5324\">Fanny Garcia</a>; Pramoedya Ananta Toer&rsquo;s <b><i>This Earth of Mankind</i></b>, translated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5425\">Thelma Kintanar</a> from the original Bahasa Indonesia into <b><i>Ang Daigdig ng Tao</i></b>, 1992; and Yasunari Kawabata&rsquo;s <b><i>Snow Country</i></b>, translated by Rogelio Sikat aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5696\">Rogelio Sicat</a> into <b><i>Lupain ng Taglamig</i></b>, 1991, from Edward G.

An important translation is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5514\">Mario Miclat</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Taong Yungib ng Peking</i></b><i> </i>(The Peking Man), 1999, a translation into Filipino of Cao Yu&rsquo;s play. Most translations of foreign works in the Philippines are sourced from the English translations of foreign texts, but Miclat worked from the original Chinese. The book is also one of the few individual efforts at translating works from Asia. Joaquin Sy has translated a number of works written in Chinese, including Bai Ren&rsquo;s novel, rendered as <b><i>Lagalag sa Nanyang </i></b>(Adrift in the Southern Sea), 2007.<i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Initiatives also came from the Committee on Culture and Information of ASEAN. This was part of the goal of the overall ASEAN COCI to publish translations of classic texts and key modern texts in English and in the national language of each participating country. Other than the translations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a> and metrical romances in the Philippines mentioned earlier, another title is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5090\">Romulo P. Baquiran Jr</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>ASEANO: An Anthology of Poems from Southeast Asia</i></b>, 1995.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Religion remains a driving force but it is no longer as pervasive. It is confined largely to the translation of the Bible in different languages by the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) and the Philippine Bible Society. Translations have also been a necessary component of studies on religion and culture, and critical assessments of these in the postcolonial period. Among these is the pathbreaking study <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1592\"><b><i>Contracting Colonialism: Christian Conversion in Tagalog Society under Early Spanish Rule</i></b></a>, 1988,<i> </i>by Vicente Rafael; Alcina&rsquo;s <b><i>Historia de las Islas e Indios de Bisayas </i></b>(History of the Islands and Indios of Visayas)<b> </b>of 1668, translated into English in 2002 by Cantius J.

Almario in 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The tradition of translating revolutionary literature which galvanized the anti-Spanish sentiments in the 19th century continues, the most popular being Rizal&rsquo;s <b><i>Noli </i></b>and <b><i>El Filibusterismo</i></b>. There are Soledad Lacson Locsin&rsquo;s and Ofelia Jamilosa-Silapan&rsquo;s in English; and Virgilio S. Almario&rsquo;s and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5725\">Ligaya Tiamson-Rubin</a>&rsquo;s in Filipino.

The Premio Zobel issues Filipino-Spanish classics in bilingual editions. Conversely, Philippine poetry and prose in Spanish translation are being published in <b><i>Perro Verde</i></b>, an annual magazine published by the Instituto Cervantes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Within the second decade of the new millennium, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\">Soledad Reyes</a> translated Tagalog classics into English: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5596\">Macario Pineda</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Gold in Makiling</i></b>, 2012; and Rosario de Guzman Lingat&rsquo;s <b><i>What Now, Ricky?</i></b>, 2013, and <b><i>The Death of Summer</i></b>, 2013. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5742\">Maria Luisa F.

Established in 1989, the primary concern of the Sentro ng Wikang Filipino is to install Filipino as the medium of instruction, research, publication, and language for official communication in accordance with the Philippine Constitution of 1987. One of its major programs is translation materials production and translator training. In this connection, it publishes a journal called <b><i>Daluyan</i></b>, begun in 1996, which has devoted issues to translation and publishes translations, and it has supported and published literature translated into Filipino from the Philippine regional languages such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2058\"><b><i>Selebrasyon at Lamentasyon: Antolohiya ng Maikling Kuwento ng Panay</i></b></a> (Celebration and Lamentation: Anthology of Short Stories of Panay), 1989, edited by Carmen L.

Among the titles are <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1946\"><i>Siso Sakradang</i> </a><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1946\">ug Iba Pa nga mga Siday han Tagoangkan</a> </i></b>(Seesaw Up and Down and Other Poems of the Womb), 2010, poems in Waray by Janice Claire Salvacion; <b><i><strong>Tanan</strong>g Namilit sa Hangin</i></b> (All in the Air), 2010, poems in Cebuano by Noel P.

Among these areas are translations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1545\">children&rsquo;s literature</a> and romance novels and best sellers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The translation of children&rsquo;s literature has been driven by educational policy to promote the national language, and to implement mother tongue instruction in the initial grades, and likewise by the business prospects of instructional materials development. A pioneering stakeholder has been Adarna House, and in the late 1990s, Lampara Books. Most titles from Adarna are in Filipino, in keeping with its vision of promoting reading and love of country, and propagating the national language, but some titles are bilingual, such as <b><i>Si Ambongan</i></b><i> </i>(Ambongan), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5046\">Lamberto Antonio</a>&rsquo;s adaptation into Filipino of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5199\">Gemma Cruz Araneta</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Little Hero of Mactan</i></b>, 2012, with a translation into Cebuano by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5021\">Erlinda Alburo</a>; Virgilio S. Almario&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Kamatis ni Peles</i></b> (Peles&rsquo;s Tomato), 2013, published in Filipino and Cebuano; Kristine Canon&rsquo;s <b><i>Bakit Matagal ang <strong>Sundo</strong> Ko</i></b> (Why Is the Person Picking Me Up Late?), 2003, published in Filipino and English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lampara has created the Easy-to-Learn Books (ETLB) for early academic learners. Most titles come out in two languages, Filipino and English. The texts in both languages are adaptations of Western classics and Filipino myths, legends, and other stories to suit the developmental stage of the readers. Among the adaptations of Western classics are <b><i>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</i></b>,<i> <b>Robinson Crusoe</b></i>,<i> <b>Alice in Wonderland</b></i>,<i> <b>Beauty and the Beast</b></i>,<i> <b>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</b></i>, and <b><i>Aesop&rsquo;s Fables</i></b>. But there are adaptations and illustrated titles for young adults, such as <b><i>Sense and Sensibility</i></b>,<i> <b>Kidnapped</b></i>,<i> <b>The Picture of Dorian</b></i><b> <i>Gray</i></b>,<i> </i>and <b><i>The Scarlet Letter</i></b>. Classic legends and myths in the Philippines are retold for today&rsquo;s young readers. Young adult novels have been translated into Filipino: <b><i>Harry Potter</i> <i>and the Sorcerer&rsquo;s Stone</i></b>, by Becky Bravo; <b><i>Charlotte&rsquo;s Web</i></b>, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5285\">Eugene Evasco</a>; and <b><i>The Fault in</i> <i>Our Stars</i></b>, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5632\">Danton Remoto</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the survey has shown, translation has been carried out largely for academic and religious purposes, but an important development in the past few decades is the tie-up between translation and the global book industry, For instance, Lampara titles have been translated into various foreign languages as a result of the company&rsquo;s efforts to tap the foreign market. It has given Wins Holland the rights to translate ELTB titles into Dutch and Portuguese for the European and Brazilian markets; likewise, it has permitted a Singaporean book distributor to translate some ETLB titles into Mandarin, Malay, Bahasa, and Tamil for the Southeast Asian market. Lampara has also acquired the rights to produce books on popular non-Filipino characters such as Dora the Explorer, Winnie the Pooh, and the superheroes of Marvel comics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Commercialism was noted with regard to the translation of popular literature in the 1930s. Today, one factor for the commercialization of translation is the demand for romance novels in Tagalog. It is the most widely read book in the country, second only to the Bible (&ldquo;Survey&rdquo; 2003). A significant slice of the market is Filipino overseas contract worker sector which has been feminized since the early 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An offshoot of the market for romance novels in Tagalog is the translation of foreign best sellers. Securing rights from international publishing houses, Precious Pages Corporation has published translations of best sellers such as <b><i>Twilight</i></b>,<i> <b>New Moon</b></i>,<i> </i>some Barbara Cartland titles, the <em>Hunger Games trilogy</em>, <b><i>Fifty Shades of</i> <i>Grey</i></b>, among others. Other titles in the pipeline are novels by other best-selling authors such as Danielle Steele, Sidney Sheldon, and Nicholas Sparks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary best sellers have also been translated into Filipino, like <b><i>The House of Spirits</i></b>, by Rosario Torres-Yu, and<i> <b>The Alchemist</b></i>, by Edgar<i> </i>Maranan. A parallel development is the translation of classics into Filipino for an academic readership. This is the target of Anvil Publishing Inc, which has published titles from Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde. This is not as lucrative as the translation of best sellers. Such translations are significant for their contribution to value formation and cultural literacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In sum, much translation in the period has been produced with a clear sense of purpose: to develop a truly national language, not just a Tagalog-based Filipino, and to mainstream regional works into a national literature. This is a long, arduous process because of our diverse cultures and languages and the difficulty of agreeing on what the national language should be, what is the canon of national literature, and how to move away from colonial and center-periphery dynamics. For instance, literatures in the local languages translated come mainly from the eight major languages, which were the preferred target ever since the Spanish period. The indigenous cultures must find their place in a national literature through translation, even while some translations have already been published, among which in this period is Carmen Unabia and Victorino Saway&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1970\"><b><i>Tula at Kuwento</i> <i>ng Katutubong Bukidnon</i></b></a> (Poetry and Stories of the Native Bukidnon), 1996. A number of publications are valuable retrievals of ethnic literatures; some of these are Manuel Dularawan&rsquo;s <b><i>Oral Literature of the <strong>Ifugao</strong></i></b>, 2005; Gerald Rixhon&rsquo;s <b><i>Voices from Sulu: A Collection of Taosug Oral Traditions</i></b>, 2010; Nicole Revel&rsquo;s <b><i>Literature of Voice, Epics of the Philippines</i></b>, 2005; and Yukihiro Yamada&rsquo;s <b><i>Ichbayat Folkways</i></b>, 1995. But these are in English translation, making minimal their contribution to the national language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other factors in the last decades have had an impact on the nature and shape of translation production in the country. These are the global economy, the attendant technologies, and a growing consciousness of our Southeast Asian connections, as manifested institutionally in ASEAN initiatives. More than ever, there is need for a vigorous and well-coordinated translation program to keep in step with these changes. Along with such programs must be developed theory and criticism on translation and adaptation grounded in Philippine experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some publications have addressed these concerns: <b><i>Salin-Suri: Panimulang Pagmamapa ng mga Larangan ng Pag-aaral sa Pagsasalin sa Filipinas</i></b><i> </i>(Translation-Analysis: Mapping Out the Field of Translation Studies in the Philippines), 2009, edited by Galileo Zafra; Maria Theresa L. de Villa&rsquo;s <b><i>Teorya at Praktika sa Pagsasalin ng &ldquo;Philippine Society and Revolution&rdquo; ni Amado Guerrero 1968-1982</i></b>,<i> </i>2002; and, with respect to adaptations, Patrick Campos&rsquo;s &ldquo;Adaptation Criticism of Screen Rizal as Metacriticism,&rdquo; 2011, and Joyce Arriola&rsquo;s &ldquo;Korido-Komiks to Film: Sourcing, Adapting and Recycling the Bernardo Carpio Story,&rdquo; 2014. A comprehensive study of Rizal&rsquo;s Tagalog translation of Schiller&rsquo;s <b><i>William Tell</i></b> is<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5358\">Ramon Guillermo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Translation and Revolution</i></b>, distinctive for its use of computer-aided method of analysis and its ideological framework. Apart from the landmark bibliography on translation <b><i>Apat na Siglo ng Pagsasalin</i> </b>mentioned<b> </b>above, other useful references are Nilo Ocampo&rsquo;s survey of theses and dissertations in the book <b><i>Pananaw at Karanasan sa Pagsasalin: Mga Teorya at Lapit</i></b>, 1992,edited by Ofelia J. Silapan, and two compendiums in which translations are listed: <b><i>A Bibliography of Philippine Linguistics</i></b>, 1996, and&nbsp;<b><i>Bibliography of SIL in the&nbsp;</i><i>Philippines</i></b>,<i> </i>2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Still, translation has been largely unexamined, an indication that it continues to be an activity secondary to creative practice and literary scholarship, with most translators remaining invisible. Theory and practice will need to be informed with new paradigms on translation that confront central issues having to do with questions on originality, loss, infidelity, equivalence, neutrality, and source-target relations, and that explore the interdisciplinary connections of translation.  <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Lilia Antonio, Jonathan Chua, and Galileo Zafra,</strong> </em><em><strong>updated by Corazon Villareal, with notes from Teresita Ang See</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Almario, Virgilio S. 1984. <em>Balagtasismo versus Modernismo: Panulaang Tagalog sa Ika-20 Siglo</em>.

When a work is adapted, it is modified to fit into certain conditions or conventions different from those in which it originally appears. Settings, for example, may be localized; and plots, rearranged, condensed, or extended to appeal to a target audience. Generally, translation is a matter of language; adaptation, of form. Thus, <a href=\"/9/9/5172\">Gerardo Chanco</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Sa Gitna ng Lusak</i></b> (Wallowing in Mud), 1918, would be a <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> translation of the Spanish version of Alexandre Dumas&#x2019;s <b><i>Camille</i></b>, 1882; Cora Ifugo&#x2019;s <b><i>Lisa</i></b>, being made for dance, would be an adaptation."

Moreover, a translation may be more than one step away from its source. For instance, <a href=\"/9/9/5745\">Joaquin Tuason</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Ang Bagong Robinson, Historiang Nagtuturo nang Mabuting Caugalian, na Ginauang Tanungan</i></b> (The New Robinson, Story That Teaches Good Conduct, Done in Primer Form), 1879, is a Tagalog translation of a Spanish translation of a German adaptation of the English novel <b><i>Robinson Crusoe</i></b>, 1719, by Daniel Defoe."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "<span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:.05pt\">Translation and adaptation are done for various purposes. They may be done to aid proselytizing and moral edification. The Philippine Bible Society, the Translator&#x2019;s Association of the Philippines, and the Summer Institute of Linguistics, for instance, have translated the Bible into different Philippine languages&#x2014;Tagalog, <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, and <a href=\"/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>&#x2014;to evangelize rural and tribal communities. Bible translation has come hand in hand with literacy projects in which indigenous folklore has been translated or adapted.<b> </b>Other translations or adaptations are done to foster nationalism or spread political propaganda. During the 19th century, translations of revolutionary literature, such as <a href=\"/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&#x2019;s essay &#x201C;El Amor Patrio&#x201D; (Love of Country), 1882, helped to spur the local folks to overthrow the Spanish colonial government. The contents of these translations advocate the love of freedom and forward a strong nationalist sentiment. Some translations or adaptations serve to heighten one&#x2019;s consciousness of other cultures, to explore one&#x2019;s own culture, and to exhibit it to foreign audiences. <b><i>Mga Piling Akda buhat sa Panitikang </i></b></span><b><i>Aleman</i></b> (Selected Works from German Literature), 1970, by <a href=\"/9/9/5506\">B. S. Medina</a> makes German literature available to non-German readers. Conversely, <b><i>Hiligaynon Literature: Texts and Contexts</i></b>, 1992, edited by <a href=\"/9/9/5385\">Lucila Hosillos</a>, and <b><i>Gaddang Literature</i></b>, 1984, edited by Ma. Luisa Lumicao-Lora, allow foreign readers to enjoy local literatures. Translation societies pursue the twin tasks of preserving national literature and conscienticizing local and foreign audience by translating works from the different local languages. Translations may also have pedagogical purposes. The translation of children&#x2019;s literature has been driven by educational policy to promote the national language, and to implement mother tongue instruction in the initial grades, and likewise by the business prospects of instructional materials development. Still other translations or adaptations, especially those of the Western classics during the early decades of American rule, serve as literary models. Local writers received pointers in writing and in experimenting with form. Other translations function primarily to provide entertainment, such as <a href=\"/9/9/5075\">N. B. Bacalso</a>&#x2019;s translation of <b><i>Captain Blood</i></b> and of the comics series <b><i>Siegfred</i></b>, and <a href=\"/7/7/3020\">Piux Kabahar</a>&#x2019;s translation of <b><i>Bertoldo, Bartolino y Cacaseno</i></b> (Bertoldo, Bartolino, and Cacaseno) by Giulio Cesare della Croce."

Centuries before the coming of the Spaniards, Southeast Asia, being located between India and China was at the nexus of trade with China, India, the Mediterranean and Eurasia. Trade cities developed quickly where Arabic, Italian, Portuguese, and Chinese were spoken, but where Malay was the lingua franca (Reid 2000, 23). Malay became an important source language in which hundreds of Malay words passed on to Tagalog. The region, the Philippines included, was thus fertile ground for translational exchange, although not in the form of published texts. <a href=\"/9/73/1551\">Folk literature</a> in various versions circulated especially in the borderless seas of maritime Southeast Asia."

In this connection, it publishes a journal called <b><i>Daluyan</i></b>, begun in 1996, which has devoted issues to translation and publishes translations, and it has supported and published literature translated into Filipino from the Philippine regional languages such as <a href=\"/9/79/2058\"><b><i>Selebrasyon at Lamentasyon: Antolohiya ng Maikling Kuwento ng Panay</i></b></a> (Celebration and Lamentation: Anthology of Short Stories of Panay), 1989, edited by Carmen L.

Most titles from Adarna are in Filipino, in keeping with its vision of promoting reading and love of country, and propagating the national language, but some titles are bilingual, such as <b><i>Si Ambongan</i></b><i> </i>(Ambongan), <a href=\"/9/9/5046\">Lamberto Antonio</a>&#x2019;s adaptation into Filipino of <a href=\"/9/9/5199\">Gemma Cruz Araneta</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>The Little Hero of Mactan</i></b>, 2012, with a translation into Cebuano by <a href=\"/9/9/5021\">Erlinda Alburo</a>; Virgilio S.

Among the adaptations of Western classics are <b><i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</i></b>,<i> <b>Robinson Crusoe</b></i>,<i> <b>Alice in Wonderland</b></i>,<i> <b>Beauty and the Beast</b></i>,<i> <b>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</b></i>, and <b><i>Aesop&#x2019;s Fables</i></b>.

It has given Wins Holland the rights to translate ELTB titles into Dutch and Portuguese for the European and Brazilian markets; likewise, it has permitted a Singaporean book distributor to translate some ETLB titles into Mandarin, Malay, Bahasa, and Tamil for the Southeast Asian market.

A parallel development is the translation of classics into Filipino for an academic readership.

Such translations are significant for their contribution to value formation and cultural literacy."

				"value": "In sum, much translation in the period has been produced with a clear sense of purpose: to develop a truly national language, not just a Tagalog-based Filipino, and to mainstream regional works into a national literature. This is a long, arduous process because of our diverse cultures and languages and the difficulty of agreeing on what the national language should be, what is the canon of national literature, and how to move away from colonial and center-periphery dynamics. For instance, literatures in the local languages translated come mainly from the eight major languages, which were the preferred target ever since the Spanish period. The indigenous cultures must find their place in a national literature through translation, even while some translations have already been published, among which in this period is Carmen Unabia and Victorino Saway&#x2019;s <a href=\"/9/78/1970\"><b><i>Tula at Kuwento</i> <i>ng Katutubong Bukidnon</i></b></a> (Poetry and Stories of the Native Bukidnon), 1996. A number of publications are valuable retrievals of ethnic literatures; some of these are Manuel Dularawan&#x2019;s <b><i>Oral Literature of the <strong>Ifugao</strong></i></b>, 2005; Gerald Rixhon&#x2019;s <b><i>Voices from Sulu: A Collection of Taosug Oral Traditions</i></b>, 2010; Nicole Revel&#x2019;s <b><i>Literature of Voice, Epics of the Philippines</i></b>, 2005; and Yukihiro Yamada&#x2019;s <b><i>Ichbayat Folkways</i></b>, 1995. But these are in English translation, making minimal their contribution to the national language."

These are the global economy, the attendant technologies, and a growing consciousness of our Southeast Asian connections, as manifested institutionally in ASEAN initiatives. More than ever, there is need for a vigorous and well-coordinated translation program to keep in step with these changes. Along with such programs must be developed theory and criticism on translation and adaptation grounded in Philippine experience."
