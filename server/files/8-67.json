It became a monthly special in the 1990s, and was adapted for the stage and performed worldwide beginning in the 2000s. The show reaffirmed and encouraged appreciation of the beauty of Filipino art and culture through music. The care and the skill that the production team put into every episode of the show were a testament of the producer&rsquo;s commitment to bringing culture closer to television audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The show pioneered in shooting musical performances in scenic spots all over the country. Mainstay and guest singers, garbed in traditional Filipino costumes, rendered musical compositions on locations like rice fields, beaches, old houses, historical places, and tourist destinations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It regularly featured Filipino musical forms like the <i>kundiman</i> (romantic ballad), the <i>balitaw</i> (Visayan folk songs), <i>harana</i> (serenades), folk songs from other regions of the country, lullabies, excerpts from <i>sarsuwela</i>, and, in some instances, contemporary Filipino compositions. Siguion-Reyna collaborated with artists like <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4203\"><strong>Restie Umali</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>, Levi Celerio, and other contemporary composers to contribute to the show. Umali composed 65 original songs and Celerio wrote 180 song lyrics for various <b><i>Aawitan Kita</i></b> episodes and specials. The show featured guest artists like <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4133\"><strong>Irma Potenciano</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4965\"><strong>Ruben Tagalog</strong></a></strong></strong>, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4151\"><strong>Conching Rosal</strong></a></strong></strong>, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4055\"><strong>Mabuhay Singers</strong></a></strong></strong>, Janet Basco, Darius Razon, Bimbo Cerrudo, and <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3358\"><strong>Cris Villonco</strong></a></strong></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Aawitan Kita</i></b>&rsquo;s first year productions were shot at the San Agustin Church and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\"><strong>Fort Santiago</strong></a> in Intramuros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some episodes of the show were musical docu-dramas that explored significant aspects of our country&rsquo;s history. Noteworthy examples of these musicals in the 1970s were &ldquo;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1292\"><strong>Sisa</strong></a></strong>,&rdquo; directed by Arling Gonzalez and Mitos Villareal, &ldquo;Pagpatak ng Ulan&rdquo; (When the Rain Drops), &ldquo;Ang Lakambini at ang Supremo&rdquo; (The Muse and the Leader), directed by Lupita Concio, and &ldquo;Dung-aw&rdquo; (Death), directed by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a></strong></strong>. &ldquo;Ang Lakambini at ang Supremo,&rdquo; 1975, is an expos&eacute; of the death of Katipunan leader <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a></strong></strong> in the hands of <i>katipunero </i>leaders from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>. &ldquo;Dung-aw,&rdquo; 1975, co-produced with the Philippine National Bank, examined agrarian issues in the Ilocos region and how these are implicated in the nationalist movement of katipuneros to create a nation. &ldquo;Dung-aw&rdquo; was written by Mario O&rsquo;Hara, with cinematography by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4734\"><strong>Romy Vitug</strong></a></strong></strong>, production design by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4743\"><strong>Fiel Zabat</strong></a></strong></strong>, music by Lutgardo Labad, editing by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4664\"><strong>Augusto Salvador</strong></a></strong></strong>, sound by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4280\"><strong>Angel Avellana</strong></a></strong></strong>, and starring Armida herself as Gabriela Silang, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4552\"><strong>Mario Montenegro</strong></a></strong></strong> as Diego Silang, and Bey Vito as Pablo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Aawitan Kita</i></b> also mounted sarsuwela on television, like &ldquo;Ang Binhi&rdquo; (The Seedling), &ldquo;Sayang&rdquo; (Lost Opportunity), &ldquo;Ang Nazareno&rdquo; (The Nazarene), and Amado Hernandez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ulo ng Lechon&rdquo; (Head of the Roasted Pig).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2005, the show was reformatted as a stage musical series, the first of which was <b><i>Aawitan Kita sa Makati</i></b> (I&rsquo;ll Sing to You in Makati),&rdquo; a special project for the senior citizens of Makati City that was continued for years as a monthly musical theater piece. <b><i>Aawitan Kita sa Amerika</i></b> (I&rsquo;ll Sing to You in America) and <b><i>Aawitan Kita sa Australia</i></b> (I&rsquo;ll Sing to You in Australia), both in 2011,<br />\r\nwere contemporary Filipino <i>sarsuwela </i>in three acts set in a typical Filipino community. Both were directed by Carlos Siguion-Reyna and written by Bibeth Orteza.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The show spawned three music recording albums: <b><i>Aawitan Kita</i></b> Volumes 1 and 2 for <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4226\"><strong>Villar Records</strong></a></strong></strong> and <b><i>Sa Lungkot at Saya . . .

The lower class family is beleaguered by the problem of finding money, even turning to prostitution and theft just to get by. The upper class is characterized by exaggerated consumption and the propensity for drugs and violence. The middle class is perpetually stressed by the pressure to move up the social ladder and the fear of falling down into the conditions of the poor.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Characters command scenes with their specific antics: the greedy, corrupt and lascivious Congressman Anding Tengco (Trinidad) who eyes the presidency; his pill-popping, shopping-crazy wife Barbara (Tomas); the spoiled brat and special child Dino Tengco (Yllana), who brandishes his family&rsquo;s guns, goons, and gold; the Tengco family&rsquo;s personal driver, hitman and fall guy, Del (Isla); the hysterical social climber Tita de los Santos (Villa), who covers her furniture with plastic; Tita&rsquo;s husband Tito (Webb), who serves as Congressman Tengco&rsquo;s campaign manager; the drivers&rsquo; union leader Samuel (Lagmay) and his wife Ningning (Inventor) who constantly nags him; the Lagmay daughter, Jenny (Sevilla), who studies in an exclusive girls&rsquo; school but who will most likely end up becoming a &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; dancer like one of the characters; the gay beautician, Benny dela Croix (Paulate), who brings to light all the other characters&rsquo; stupidities; Benny&rsquo;s idiotic provincial lass and nightclub dancer, Clara (Martin), who graduated with honors from a university in the province; and a host of characters that spoof the lifestyle of the political elite, the economically rich, and the masses. All are portrayed in exaggeration, making caricatures of identifiable real-life personalities and social issues.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The program faced problems as an alternative comedy show. A member of the House of Representatives complained when his family name was used as the congressman&rsquo;s name, causing the change into the name &ldquo;Tengco.&rdquo; Advertisers were wary of supporting a program that was initially too critical of politics. Viewers also had difficulty following the flow of the story when they missed certain episodes and so the show was reformatted as an episodic sitcom. The compromise was to make a socially relevant comedy program that could be enjoyed by the masses but would not touch on specific political situations and real-life personages that would merit censorship and advertisers&rsquo; boycott.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Abangan</i></b> was remade by ABS-CBN as <b><i>Eto Na Ang Susunod na Kabanata</i> (</b>This is the New Chapter<b>)</b> in 2001-03, following the same format and satirical style, and starred almost all the original members of the program, except Webb and Yllana.

Each episode&rsquo;s focus on natural disasters emphasizes that humanity cannot fully master nature. The program examined several environmental catastrophes that occurred in the Philippines across decades, juxtaposes these events with disasters in Japan, New Zealand, the United States and Africa, and describes the resilience of Filipinos in the wake of tragedies.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The promotional video teasers disseminated prior to the launch of the pilot episode underscored the need for disaster awareness and preparation.

Its mission was to bring color and joy to all children by inspiring them to be creative and taking them to different art adventures, thus the program&rsquo;s slogan &ldquo;Ating Mundo&rsquo;y Gawing Makulay&rdquo; (Let&rsquo;s Make Our World Colorful).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Each episode revolved around a central theme and featured regular segments done in the huge <b><i>Art Angel </i></b>set in GMA&rsquo;s Studio 2. The &ldquo;Main Project&rdquo; featured an exciting, easy-to-do art project. As hosts Ate Pia and Kuya Tonipet gave a step-by-step demo. Gelo, the animated, wise-cracking angel-dog, would pop out onscreen to give his zany remarks as the cautious &ldquo;Teka-Muna Angel&rdquo; (Wait-a-Minute Angel), voiced by a kid, is heard every now and then to give safety reminders in using scissors, cutter, and glue gun. &ldquo;Art Iba Pa&hellip;&rdquo; (Art Etc.) featured Ate Pia and co-host Krystal doing simple arts and crafts projects which children and their moms could also do together. In &ldquo;Pintado&rdquo; (Painted), Kuya Tonipet joined Pintado, the tattooed/painted hand, in this guessing game-basic drawing instructional rolled into one. In &ldquo;Lights, Camera, Obra!&rdquo; (Lights, Camera, Artwork), guest celebrities would take a break from their hectic schedules to flex their artistic skills.

It presented the <i>bahay kubo</i> (nipa hut) as the most common house of Filipinos, especially in the past. It is built with basic, cheap but durable materials, such as the <i>kugon</i> (cogon grass) and the bamboo, thereby making it adaptable to the weather conditions of the country. Its large windows let in more air and light, which allows for a natural ventilation of the structure.

It presented the elevated native houses of Bukidnon in Mindanao, which are now rarely seen. It also featured the Monastery of Transfiguration in Malaybalay City designed by Architect Leandro Locsin which was based on the basic bahay kubo. The highlight of the second part is the feature on the architecture of the houses of two indigenous groups, the Daraghuyan-Bukidnon and the Talaandig, whose ancestors have chosen some portions of Mt Kitanglad, also in Bukidnon, as their settlement site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Daraghuyan Cultural Heritage Center, popularly known in Bukidnon as the modern <i>tologan</i> (clan house),<i> </i>is a living space for the entire tribal community.

Producer and Host: Guidote-Alvarez.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Conceded by many as the exemplar of Filipino drama on television, the pre-martial law <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> was a joint venture of ABC-5, then owned by Marcos Roces, and the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA), which Cecile Guidote-Alvarez founded and headed at that time. The program brought to the mass television audience the best in Philippine literature, especially prize-winning short stories, plays, and excerpts from novels adapted for TV, and original teleplays by established and new writers and playwrights. It ran for a total of 250 weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The title <b><i>Balintataw</i></b>, proposed by Mauro R. Avena and highly recommended by writer Clodualdo del Mundo Sr, specifically refers to the mind&rsquo;s eye, a &ldquo;space within which the creative imagination can freely breathe, move, and expand.&rdquo; Lupita Concio and Joey Gosiengfiao, who were then on the pool of artists of Channel 5, were involved with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3169\"><strong>PETA</strong></a> in the planning and execution of the program. Concio served as the program&rsquo;s first director and Gosiengfiao the show&rsquo;s first stage manager, a job that would subsequently be handled by Jose Roy Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4596\"><strong>Elwood Perez</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Avena wrote the pilot scripts of the program. The first script he wrote was &ldquo;Ang Mananayaw&rdquo; (The Dancer), an adaptation of Alberto Florentino&rsquo;s one-act play <b><i>The Dancers</i></b>. The first script, however, that went on air when <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> premiered on 19 Aug 1967 was &ldquo;Inulang Tipanan&rdquo; (Rain-drenched Rendezvous), an adaptation of a story written by Concio, about a middle-class young lady, played by an uninitiated in drama, socialite Chingbee <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>w.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The weekly drama program follows a standard format.

Host Arevalo then makes his appearance to introduce the teleplay. Next is the drama proper. The host returns at the end to round up the presentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike its contemporaries, <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> was not star-oriented. It had no acting mainstay. Actors for both the main and supporting roles, including short appearances, came mainly from theater and film. For example, the episode &ldquo;Inanod ng Biyaya&rdquo; (Swept by Grace), an adaptation by Avena of Linda Ty Casper&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;The Dead Well,&rdquo; had stage actor Adul de Leon. &ldquo;Kabalyerong Tanso&rdquo; (A <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/545\"><strong>Fake</strong></a> Knight), an adaptation by Wilfrido Sanchez of a Filipino literary piece in English, had stage actors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2716\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2716\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2716\"><strong>Tommy Abuel</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a> and Jimmy Asencio essaying roles with respected movie actors Vic Silayan and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4593\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4593\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4593\"><strong>Barbara Perez</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>.

Mimeographed copies of the script were distributed to each member of the production team.

Younger writers of the period, such as Tony Perez and Franklin Osorio, also contributed memorable teleplays for <b><i>Balintataw</i></b>. Some original teleplays were Elwood Perez&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ina sa Lupang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>&rdquo; (Mother in a Free Land) and &ldquo;Ang Pagdalaw ng Isang Kahapon&rdquo; (The Visit of a Yesterday), and Pierre Salas&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Aguinaldo Ko ay Ikaw&rdquo; (You are my Gift) and &ldquo;Wanted: A Secretary.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Balintataw </i></b>also featured foreign literary classics. Among the plays that it adapted to Filipino life and to the television medium were Paddy Chayefsky&rsquo;s <b><i>The Mother</i></b>, Rod Serling&rsquo;s <b><i>Requiem for a Heavyweight</i></b>, Arthur Miller&rsquo;s <b><i>Death of a Salesman</i></b> and <b><i>All My Sons</i></b>, Tennessee <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a>s&rsquo;s <b><i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i></b> and <b><i>This Property is Condemned</i></b>, Anton Chekov&rsquo;s <b><i>Three Sisters</i></b>, Eugene Ionesco&rsquo;s <b><i>The Bald Soprano</i></b>, and Robert Anderson&rsquo;s <b><i>Tea and Sympathy</i></b>. <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> also adapted for television stories and novels of D.

Henry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The program explored human and social relationships through a social realist lens that contextualized the struggles and challenges faced by the characters of the drama in concrete political conditions of the country. Characters included the prostitute, the other woman, a drug pusher, an ageing actress, a Protestant missionary, a revolutionary, a lovelorn landlady, a labor leader, a senator, a poet, a hero, a swinger, and a socialite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Balintataw</i></b> introduced many &ldquo;firsts&rdquo; in Philippine television. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> was the first kiss on local TV, with actor Nestor Torre kissing on the lips a theater actress from the University of the Philippines in the episode &ldquo;Goodbye, My Gentle&rdquo;. Most of its episodes concluded with an &ldquo;unhappy ending,&rdquo; which was uncommon during the period when much of the drama on TV was romantic and idealist. It also introduced themes unexplored by local soaps during the period: the <i>bakla</i> or gay in &ldquo;Duplex;&rdquo; blatantly political issues in &ldquo;Idolo ng Madla&rdquo; (Idol of the Masses); religio-sexual themes in &ldquo;Mambo Girl;&rdquo; poverty, prostitution, and squatter demolition in &ldquo;Oli Impan (Holy Infant);&rdquo; and social unrest, such as those resulting from agrarian conflict in &ldquo;Lagablab sa Karimlan&rdquo; (Conflagration in the Twilight) and the massacre of farmers in &ldquo;Sa Bawat Patak ng Dugo (For Every Drop of Blood).&rdquo; Other social issues tackled by the program included the Intramuros of the 1800s, postwar Intramuros slums, the bleak Ilocos landscape, a logging camp, indigenous peoples such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/149\"><strong>Igorot</strong></a>, issues in a fishing village, sensitive liaisons, the presence of US military bases in the country and its consequences, such as the G.I. baby, and many issues concerning social injustices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of <b><i>Balintataw</i></b>&rsquo;s stories were tragic, the characters ending up dead, defeated, or dehumanized. It presented society as a prison from which the characters could not escape. The program, however, also explored other genres like situational comedy, farce, period play, and dance drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Balintataw</i></b> introduced innovations in local television production: the use of a full script based on quality material; the appointment of a script supervisor to oversee the quality of the scripts; the use of a stable of scriptwriters instead of one regular writer and a pool of stage directors; and the use of serious actors from theater and film instead of box-office stars. Most importantly, the drama anthology respected its audience as thinking and discriminating individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The program went off the air in Mar 1972. Guidote-Alvarez revived the program on the government station PTV-4 in 1987 upon her return to the Philippines from self-exile in the United States. The post-EDSA <b><i>Balintataw </i></b>maintained its original format. It also went into radio in 1987, but reformatted as a cultural magazine program aimed at confronting the global challenges of poverty and climate change. <b><i>Radyo Balintataw</i></b>, hosted by Guidote-Alvarez, is aired daily on DZRH. It features drama, poetry, music, and storytelling during weekdays, and interviews, reports and commentaries on socio-political issues with focus on eco-cultural concerns every Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Balintataw</i></b> and its directors, writers, and performers won 18 Citizens&rsquo; Awards for Television (CAT) from the Citizens Council for Mass Media from 1967 to 1972, including five for best drama anthology, plus the CAT Hall of Fame Award in 1972. The revived <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> received the Gawad CCP Para sa Telebisyon in 1988 and 1991. <b><i>Radyo Balintataw</i></b> won the KBP Golden Dove Award for best culture and arts program, 2008 and 2014; best drama program, 2008; best drama series, 2013 and 2014; and best documentary, 2012. It won best drama and best entertainment program, both in 2014, from the Catholic Mass Media Awards. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Eulalio R.

Mimeographed copies of the script were distributed to each member of the production team.

Composed of footage and photos from actual events, the documentary chronologically narrates the horrors of martial rule. It first presents how Marcos appealed the murder conviction against him in the Supreme Court and won acquittal, after which he won government positions, became a Senator, then rose to the presidency. Interviews with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos defending her husband&rsquo;s &ldquo;compassionate society,&rdquo; denying human rights violations, and justifying the vision of &ldquo;The New Society&rdquo; are juxtaposed with footage of the violence of the Marcos dispensation, such as torture, summary execution, bloody demonstrations, and arrest of opposition leaders and student activists.

				"value": "The 90-minute documentary tackles the dark period of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, beginning from his re-election as President in 1969, to the declaration of martial law in 1972, until the EDSA People Power Revolution that overthrew his regime in 1986. Composed of footage and photos from actual events, the documentary chronologically narrates the horrors of martial rule. It first presents how Marcos appealed the murder conviction against him in the Supreme Court and won acquittal, after which he won government positions, became a Senator, then rose to the presidency. Interviews with <a href=\"/4/24/1189\"><strong>Imelda</strong></a> Marcos defending her husband&#x2019;s &#x201C;compassionate society,&#x201D; denying human rights violations, and justifying the vision of &#x201C;The New Society&#x201D; are juxtaposed with footage of the violence of the Marcos dispensation, such as torture, summary execution, bloody demonstrations, and arrest of opposition leaders and student activists. The irony is heavily emphasized with the &#x201C;Bagong Lipunan&#x201D; (New Society) hymn of the government embedded in the sequences that reveal the tyranny of the regime. The documentary details Marcos&#x2019;s political moves and corruption to keep himself in power, discusses events such as the First Quarter Storm and the bombing of Plaza Miranda, analyzes crony capitalism, and enumerates the Rolex 12, which is the collective name of 12 of the closest and most powerful advisers of Marcos who were mostly members of the military."

The word <i>batibot</i> means &ldquo;small but strong,&rdquo; an apt description for the show&rsquo;s production style and objective of empowering Filipino children. The program&rsquo;s predecessor, <b><i>Sesame!</i></b>, was a 1980s co-production of the Philippine Sesame Street Project (PSSP), then managed by the Philippine government&rsquo;s Ministry of Human Settlements, and the New York-based Children&rsquo;s Television Workshop (CTW), the producer of the TV program <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b>. <b><i>Sesame!</i></b> consisted of segments in English and Filipino in a magazine format. The PSSP became the Philippine Children&rsquo;s Television Foundation, the producer of <b><i>Batibot</i></b>, when it parted ways with CTW in 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Batibot</i></b> followed a magazine format that mixes studio sequences with storytelling, situational skits, modular lessons, short educational music videos, animation, live action films, and puppetry to produce an integrated learning experience for the child. The contents convey Filipino nationalism through the use of the Filipino language and appreciation of things Filipino. Its segments address the lives of Filipino children, framed by an educational curriculum that considers the child&rsquo;s intellectual, psycho-motor, moral, and sociocultural development. A significant segment that helps reawaken Filipino children&rsquo;s love for literature is &ldquo;Mga Kuwento ni Kuya Bodjie&rdquo; in which Kuya Bodjie (Pascua) uses direct on-camera storytelling, supplemented by colorful illustrations depicting choice scenes. The show&rsquo;s 30-minute radio version, <b><i>Radyo Batibot</i></b>, specifically designed for children with ages 7 to 12, follows the same format, but designs the lessons, content, and approaches appropriate for the characteristics, needs, and interests of its target audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Batibot</i></b> featured characters from Philippine folk tales, like Pong Pagong, the six-foot giant turtle mascot who stands on his hind legs, towers over human characters, and loves <i>kangkong</i> (water spinach), and Kiko Matsing, the husky-voiced, smart-alecky muppet monkey. Some mainstay muppet characters include the young chatty sisters Ningning and Gingging; the inquisitive and child-like creatures from outer space, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1008\"><strong>Sitsiritsit</strong></a> and Alibangbang, whose names are derived from a nursery rhyme; the talkative and fashion-conscious starlet, Irma Daldal, and her male partner, Tikyo Tiktilaok; the superhero Kapitan Basa who loves to read; and the lovable bespectacled fortune teller Manang Bola who, ironically, sometimes suffers from memory loss and whose lines when consulting her crystal ball &ldquo;Perlas na bilog, huwag tutulog, sabihin agad sa akin ang sagot&rdquo; (Crystal ball, be alert, tell me right away the answer) followed by &ldquo;ba be bi bo bu&rdquo; became so popular in teaching vowel sounds and an effective way to answer the many questions of children. These muppets keep company with friendly human characters, like the resident storyteller Kuya Bodjie (Pascua), the helpful lady Aling Nena (Ferro), big brothers Mang Lino (Gruta) and Mang Mokyo (Cruz), jeepney driver Kuya Ching (Arellano), and the caring neighborhood friends Luz (Dessa Quesada), Ate Sylvia (Africa), Ate Isay (Alvarez-Se&ntilde;a), Ate Sienna (Olaso), Kuya (Inocian), Ben (Quesada), and JD (Bunso).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1994, Pong Pagong and Kiko Matsing were pulled out from the show because of alleged licensing issues with CTW. In 1999, PCTVF cooperated with Ry/Bashman Productions in repackaging the show as <b><i>Batang Batibot</i></b> but went off the air in 2000 when it had difficulties facing tough competition from the growing number of Filipino and foreign educational programs. The revived program in 2010, with some original and new cast members, featured two segments, &ldquo;Kwentong Batibot&rdquo; (Batibot <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a>) and &ldquo;Balik Batibot&rdquo; (Return to Batibot), a collection of selected episodes from the original <b><i>Batibot</i></b> program.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Batibot </i></b>spawned the production of children&rsquo;s books, cassette tapes of the program&rsquo;s songs, language learning tapes and videos, live entertainment programs that focus on environmental protection, and the same company&rsquo;s production of the Chinese-Filipino TV program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1485\"><strong>Pin-Pin</strong></a></i></b> and another children&rsquo;s TV show <b><i>Koko Kwik Kwak</i></b>, whose character is a four-year-old eaglet patterned after Pag-asa, the first Philippine eagle hatched under laboratory conditions. PCTVF produced 6,650 episodes in a span of 22 years, plus 29 episodes from the revival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Batibot</i></b>&rsquo;s numerous awards include the Gawad CCP Para sa Telebisyon in 1987, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1994, and 1995; the KBP Golden Dove Awards in 1991, 1992, 1995, 1997, 2000, and 2011; the PMPC Star Awards for TV in 1987, 1989, 1992, 1997, 2000, and 2013; and several Catholic Mass Media Awards. It also won several awards and commendations from the Prix Jeunesse International Festival which includes the Special Jury Prize in 1990, the BMW prize for the &ldquo;most outstanding program produced with limited facilities&rdquo; in 1998, and the UNICEF Prize in 2002. Batibot was also one of the finalists in the &ldquo;Up to 6 years old Non-Fiction&rdquo; category of the same festival. Pascua also won two PMPC Star Awards, as best children&rsquo;s show host, in 1987 and 1988. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Romulo P. Baquiran Jr, Eulalio R.

The word <i>batibot</i> means &#x201C;small but strong,&#x201D; an apt description for the show&#x2019;s production style and objective of empowering Filipino children. The program&#x2019;s predecessor, <b><i>Sesame!</i></b>, was a 1980s co-production of the Philippine Sesame Street Project (PSSP), then managed by the Philippine government&#x2019;s Ministry of Human Settlements, and the New York-based Children&#x2019;s Television Workshop (CTW), the producer of the TV program <b><i>Sesame Street</i></b>. <b><i>Sesame!</i></b> consisted of segments in English and Filipino in a magazine format. The PSSP became the Philippine Children&#x2019;s Television Foundation, the producer of <b><i>Batibot</i></b>, when it parted ways with CTW in 1984."

The contents convey Filipino nationalism through the use of the Filipino language and appreciation of things Filipino. Its segments address the lives of Filipino children, framed by an educational curriculum that considers the child&#x2019;s intellectual, psycho-motor, moral, and sociocultural development. A significant segment that helps reawaken Filipino children&#x2019;s love for literature is &#x201C;Mga Kuwento ni Kuya Bodjie&#x201D; in which Kuya Bodjie (Pascua) uses direct on-camera storytelling, supplemented by colorful illustrations depicting choice scenes. The show&#x2019;s 30-minute radio version, <b><i>Radyo Batibot</i></b>, specifically designed for children with ages 7 to 12, follows the same format, but designs the lessons, content, and approaches appropriate for the characteristics, needs, and interests of its target audience."

Some mainstay muppet characters include the young chatty sisters Ningning and Gingging; the inquisitive and child-like creatures from outer space, <a href=\"/5/40/1008\"><strong>Sitsiritsit</strong></a> and Alibangbang, whose names are derived from a nursery rhyme; the talkative and fashion-conscious starlet, Irma Daldal, and her male partner, Tikyo Tiktilaok; the superhero Kapitan Basa who loves to read; and the lovable bespectacled fortune teller Manang Bola who, ironically, sometimes suffers from memory loss and whose lines when consulting her crystal ball &#x201C;Perlas na bilog, huwag tutulog, sabihin agad sa akin ang sagot&#x201D; (Crystal ball, be alert, tell me right away the answer) followed by &#x201C;ba be bi bo bu&#x201D; became so popular in teaching vowel sounds and an effective way to answer the many questions of children. These muppets keep company with friendly human characters, like the resident storyteller Kuya Bodjie (Pascua), the helpful lady Aling Nena (Ferro), big brothers Mang Lino (Gruta) and Mang Mokyo (Cruz), jeepney driver Kuya Ching (Arellano), and the caring neighborhood friends Luz (Dessa Quesada), Ate Sylvia (Africa), Ate Isay (Alvarez-Se&#xF1;a), Ate Sienna (Olaso), Kuya (Inocian), Ben (Quesada), and JD (Bunso)."

It uses the concept of time and space travel as a narrative device to move across the past and the present and to historically significant locales. The plot usually involves a quest where the children need to retrieve important objects from the past. The program is a platform for teaching Filipino values, such as love for family, hard work, and sincerity. Some episodes underscore the equal treatment of men and women in the anti-colonial struggle, like the ones on Josefa Rizal, leader of the association of women in the Katipunan; Ka Oryang or Gregoria de Jesus, the Lakambini of the Katipunan; Gregoria Silang; and the <i>babaylan</i> (indigenous shamans). The program also touches on Filipino concepts like <i>loob </i>(interiority), <i>kapatiran </i>(brotherhood and sisterhood), <i>paglilingkod sa bayan </i>(serving the country)<i>, </i>and <i>kalayaan </i>(freedom).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first episode, &ldquo;Abaniko&rdquo; (Fan), directed and written by Uro dela Cruz, was shot in Intramuros and Tanay, Rizal. The adventure begins when young Noli and Aya, running away from school bullies, find their way inside a mysterious cave. Here, they meet an old hermit who Aya realizes is bound by a rope. The hermit says that the cave contains the memories of the past and that history is the soul of the nation. He is sure that the children were brought here by fate. The children then open a book called &ldquo;Aklat ng Kasaysayan.&rdquo; The old man tells them that they are the first ones who are able to open it because they are pure of heart (&ldquo;<i>may busilak na kalooban</i>&rdquo;). The hermit tells them that he needs their help to recover memories that were stolen from the cave. Their first mission is to find the first <i>abaniko </i>made by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\"><strong>Andres Bonifacio</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>.

It uses the concept of time and space travel as a narrative device to move across the past and the present and to historically significant locales. The plot usually involves a quest where the children need to retrieve important objects from the past. The program is a platform for teaching Filipino values, such as love for family, hard work, and sincerity. Some episodes underscore the equal treatment of men and women in the anti-colonial struggle, like the ones on Josefa Rizal, leader of the association of women in the Katipunan; Ka Oryang or Gregoria de Jesus, the Lakambini of the Katipunan; Gregoria Silang; and the <i>babaylan</i> (indigenous shamans). The program also touches on Filipino concepts like <i>loob </i>(interiority), <i>kapatiran </i>(brotherhood and sisterhood), <i>paglilingkod sa bayan </i>(serving the country)<i>, </i>and <i>kalayaan </i>(freedom)."

The drama contextualizes the people&rsquo;s quest for national identity and the formation of the Filipino nation. It interrogates the <i>encomienda </i>(land ownership) system, the frailocracy of the Catholic Church, the political and economic power of land-owning elites, the complicity of the <i>indio</i> (natives) in the perpetuation of an unjust social order, and the complexity of the revolt of the masses. It disrupts the colonizer-colonized, foreign-native, and rich-poor binary oppositions by pointing out that the social cancer is brought about by a mix of imperialist expansion, patron-client human relations, and conflicting self-interests in all social classes in a highly stratified society undergoing profound changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The story begins in Manila in a meeting of the <i>kilusan</i>, a clandestine revolutionary organization, attended by Crispin, one of its leaders, and Victoria, one of the women, who play a key role in the movement. News has spread that the propagandist <strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><strong>Jose Rizal</strong></a></strong></strong></strong> has been arrested by the authorities. Carlos Luzzuriaga, a young <i>teniente </i>(assistant to the political leader) assigned in Manila, returns to his hometown in Sta. Filomena in Ilocos to help his mother, Se&ntilde;ora Corazon, a <i>criolla </i>(a Spaniard born in the Philippines), deal with farmworkers who are opposing the increase in the rent for the use of the land of the family&rsquo;s hacienda. He orders the houses of the peasants burned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The initial episodes introduce other key characters. Gabriela is the spoiled, educated, and adventurous Luzzuriaga heiress who keeps copies of the banned novels of Jose Rizal. She has recently been fired from her teaching stint in Manila. Dr. Juanito Morga, a Spaniard who is a guest of the Luzzuriagas, is in Sta. Filomena to provide medical services to the community. He is attracted to his assistant Sabel, who introduces him to the plight of the indio and gains their trust. Agustin, an indio, provides Teniente Carlos and his sergeant information about the activities of the indio. The articulate leader of the hacienda workers, Crisanto or Anto, and his friend Abel discuss with workers two organizations to which they can belong, the Cuerpo de Compromisarios (assimilationists) or the organization they know only by its acronym, the KKK. Gabriela seeks out Anto and listens to his story: he went to school, but was bullied and kicked out because of the color of his skin, imprisoned for retaliating against a classmate, and tortured. He then swore never to go back to school, and returned to Sta. Filomena to work in the hacienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Victoria, posing as Anto&rsquo;s aunt, arrives in the hacienda, introduces the Katipunan to the farm workers, and convinces them of the importance of a national movement over scattered local groups. Doubted at first because of her being a woman, she exhorts the people to take up arms, but explains that awakening and unity entail a change of one&rsquo;s <i>loob</i> (interiority), which many neglect when they join the revolutionary group. Anto, marked by Agustin as the leader of the clandestine organization, is arrested and tortured by a fellow indio working in the cuartel. Victoria flees for her safety and hides in Sabel&rsquo;s house. Gabriela begs her mother to convince Carlos to set Anto and his comrades free, but Carlos stands firm in his view that the affairs of war, like running the hacienda, cannot be reduced to a choice between <i>misericordia</i> (misery) and <i>crueldad</i> (cruelty).

The drama contextualizes the people&#x2019;s quest for national identity and the formation of the Filipino nation. It interrogates the <i>encomienda </i>(land ownership) system, the frailocracy of the Catholic Church, the political and economic power of land-owning elites, the complicity of the <i>indio</i> (natives) in the perpetuation of an unjust social order, and the complexity of the revolt of the masses. It disrupts the colonizer-colonized, foreign-native, and rich-poor binary oppositions by pointing out that the social cancer is brought about by a mix of imperialist expansion, patron-client human relations, and conflicting self-interests in all social classes in a highly stratified society undergoing profound changes."

She has recently been fired from her teaching stint in Manila. Dr. Juanito Morga, a Spaniard who is a guest of the Luzzuriagas, is in Sta. Filomena to provide medical services to the community. He is attracted to his assistant Sabel, who introduces him to the plight of the indio and gains their trust. Agustin, an indio, provides Teniente Carlos and his sergeant information about the activities of the indio. The articulate leader of the hacienda workers, Crisanto or Anto, and his friend Abel discuss with workers two organizations to which they can belong, the Cuerpo de Compromisarios (assimilationists) or the organization they know only by its acronym, the KKK. Gabriela seeks out Anto and listens to his story: he went to school, but was bullied and kicked out because of the color of his skin, imprisoned for retaliating against a classmate, and tortured. He then swore never to go back to school, and returned to Sta. Filomena to work in the hacienda."

Anto, marked by Agustin as the leader of the clandestine organization, is arrested and tortured by a fellow indio working in the cuartel. Victoria flees for her safety and hides in Sabel&#x2019;s house. Gabriela begs her mother to convince Carlos to set Anto and his comrades free, but Carlos stands firm in his view that the affairs of war, like running the hacienda, cannot be reduced to a choice between <i>misericordia</i> (misery) and <i>crueldad</i> (cruelty). Anto and Victoria are able to convince Sabel, whose father was humiliated by a Spanish friar, to join the Katipunan.

Beginning in 2010, the program was broadcast in the United States Bay Area, Canada, and Russia through PTV-4&rsquo;s international network until its final airing in 2012. The &ldquo;Concert at the Park&rdquo; event in Rizal Park , however, is still ongoing. The program&rsquo;s title was coined by the show&rsquo;s director Ed Finlan.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Concert at the Park</i></b> provided its audience the regular public concerts held in Luneta to help in promoting appreciation and support for Filipino culture through music and dance. It mainly featured the classics, but also had performances of popular bands and recording artists.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was initially conceived to be held at the Philamlife Auditorium on United Nations Avenue in Manila on a Sunday morning to be patterned after the successful Boston Pop Orchestra concert series. It would have featured the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\"><strong>Manila Symphony Orchestra</strong></a> under the baton of Professor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4024\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4025\"><strong>Regalado Jose</strong></a></strong></a> and the mezzo-soprano performer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3996\"><strong>Conchita Gaston</strong></a>. The initial plan was shelved because of financial matters.

The contestant who garners the highest point wins. The first round is &ldquo;Password,&rdquo; in which each contestant is given one minute to guess a word. The hosts give five clues, each flashed on LG screens. Correctly guessing the word at the first clue garners huge points for the student, each point lower by a few notches for each subsequent clue. The second round is &ldquo;Picture Puzzle,&rdquo; in which the contestants guess the picture hidden beneath nine jigsaw puzzle pieces. The student who buzzes first and answers correctly the question posed by the host gains points and gets to remove one piece of the puzzle. The first to guess correctly the hidden picture gains additional points. The third round is the 10-minute &ldquo;Think Tac Toe,&rdquo; a modified tic-tac-toe, in which the students race to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line by answering correct answers to questions chosen from &ldquo;flying saucers&rdquo; on a 3x3 grid. The fourth round is &ldquo;Blockbuster,&rdquo; in which the hosts ask questions based on footage of movies shown on LG digital TVs. The final round is &ldquo;Megabytes,&rdquo; in which each student is given chips, each with an assigned subject such as Mathematics, Science, and General Knowledge. A student earns or loses points depending on the value of wagered chips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Weekly winners compete in the monthly competition.

The third round is the 10-minute &#x201C;Think Tac Toe,&#x201D; a modified tic-tac-toe, in which the students race to form a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line by answering correct answers to questions chosen from &#x201C;flying saucers&#x201D; on a 3x3 grid. The fourth round is &#x201C;Blockbuster,&#x201D; in which the hosts ask questions based on footage of movies shown on LG digital TVs. The final round is &#x201C;Megabytes,&#x201D; in which each student is given chips, each with an assigned subject such as Mathematics, Science, and General Knowledge. A student earns or loses points depending on the value of wagered chips."

ABS-CBN General Manager <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4838\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4838\"><strong>Freddie Garcia</strong></a></strong></a> patterned the program after the tabloid-style, revenue-raking news programs of the network, such as <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, <b><i>Hoy Gising!</i></b> (Hey, Wake Up!), and <b><i>Magandang Gabi, Bayan</i></b> (Good Evening, Nation). Host Puno analyzed the week&rsquo;s hot issues by interviewing public officials and celebrities, who were either in the studio or on-location, the signals of which are fed live to the program via video satellite or phone patch.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An episode begins with the introduction of guests, followed by a reporter&rsquo;s short coverage of the issue up for discussion, then the host&rsquo;s discussion with the guests. During the debate, the screen is divided into three panels, two of which are for each of the guests, while the third at the center is for the host. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the two panels for guests is switched to an on-location guest, if there is any. In some cases, both panels for guests are shown on the screen, maintaining the center panel for the host.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the intensified infrastructure and systems upgrade of ABS-CBN, <b><i>Dong Puno Live </i></b>is able to do multi-point simultaneous broadcasts from various parts of the country, making it one of the first interactive programs on Philippine television. Its pilot episode, for instance, which was about the MV Gretchen sea mishap, brought in various live video coverage interviews with the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) headquarters in two areas in Manila and a phone patch interview in Cadiz City, Negros Occidental in the Visayas. The program made use of a similar technical format for its other episodes with guests from Cebu in the Visayas, and Davao, Cagayan de Oro, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> in Mindanao. Live phone-patched questions, usually from four to five televiewers, also come from different regions of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some notable episodes are those featuring political rivals, particularly during the elections of 1995 and 1998.

The  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4968\">TVJ</a></strong> triumvirate of brothers Tito and Vic Sotto and friend Joey de Leon began in 1979 on the weekly dance variety program <b><i>Discorama</i></b> and later the daily noontime show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1509\"><strong>Student Canteen</strong></a></i></b>, both produced by Program Philippines and broadcast on GMA. They initially refused producer Tony Tuviera&rsquo;s offer to host their own lunchtime program, in deference to competitor Bobby Ledesma who provided them employment through <b><i>Discorama</i></b>, but eventually accepted the offer after Ledesma fired them from the show because he believed that they were being congenial to his rival&rsquo;s moves.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The show&rsquo;s title is de Leon&rsquo;s invention, a pun on the children&rsquo;s game &ldquo;it bulaga&rdquo; (peek-a-boo), with &ldquo;eat&rdquo; referring to what people do at lunchtime and &ldquo;bulaga&rdquo; indicating that the show would be full of surprises. <b><i>EB</i></b> initially had problems of low revenues because commercial advertisers went to their rival program. Some of their co-hosts resigned, frustrated with not receiving their pay on time. TVJ were able to survive owing to their other jobs. The switch to domestic satellite (domsat) broadcast that provided nationwide live coverage of a program, beginning on 18 May 1982, coupled by the co-hosting launch of pretty and popular Coney Reyes, who was also ousted from <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>, paved the way for the show&rsquo;s dominance of its time slot. Prior to domsat, TV shows were only viewed in the provinces days after actual telecast; with it, advertisers gradually flocked to <b><i>EB</i></b>, assuring it of sustainability. Certain sectors called the attention of the network not to &ldquo;overdo commercialism&rdquo; to protect the integrity of the television industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>EB </i></b>crafted pioneering segments, the first of which was &ldquo;Bulagaan,&rdquo; which began in 1975. The hosts are in a classroom setup where they act as students who make puns on their supposedly knowledgeable answers to the teacher&rsquo;s quiz. The segment popularized so-called &ldquo;knock-knock&rdquo; jokes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beauty and talent search segments for men, ladies, boys, children, gay men, and foreigners are a common offering of the program. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> season annually, biennially or when deemed commercially viable by producers is devoted to any of these segments, many of which continue to this day. In 1980, it initiated the contest &ldquo;Mr. Macho&rdquo; for the promotion of the film <b><i>You Can&rsquo;t Stop the Music</i></b> starring the Village People. This was the first time that the program won the ratings game against <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>, gaining 31% against the latter&rsquo;s 29%. &ldquo;Little Miss Philippines,&rdquo; undeniably the most popular segment that was launched in 1984, jumpstarted the media career of Aiza Seguerra, a runner-up winner in 1987 who dazzled millions of viewers with her wit and crazy antics, such as the &ldquo;duck walk&rdquo; and &ldquo;acheche&rdquo; (an expression of surprise or incredulity rendered in a funny way), and Ryzza Mae Dizon, the title holder in 2012 who amuses audiences with her mature takes on various topics. Some runners-up or daily winners made it big in show business, such as Donna Cruz, Geneva Cruz, Pauleen Luna,  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4586\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4586\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4587\"><strong>Angelica Panganiban</strong></a></strong></a></a></strong>, Camille Pratts, Francine Prieto, Gladys Reyes, and Jessa Zaragosa. A pageant for young men which began in 1996, &ldquo;Mr. Pogi&rdquo; (Mr. Handsome), was seized upon by many who wanted to enter show business, like  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4653\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4653\"><strong>Jericho Rosales</strong></a></a></strong> who won in 1996 and became one of the country&rsquo;s admired actors and who also became popular in Southeast Asia and Africa. It also opened doors for the showbiz careers of Danilo Barrios, 1998 winner, who became a member of a popular dance group, and Edgar Allan Guzman, 2006 winner, who established his career as an actor in indie movies. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s My Boy&rdquo; for young boys, which began in 1991, introduced child actor Atong Redillas and BJ Forbes, while &ldquo;She&rsquo;s Got the Look&rdquo; for ladies, 1991-95, discovered actor  <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4637\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4637\"><strong>Rosanna Roces</strong></a></a></strong> who initially won its daily round but lost the weekly finals. The segment &ldquo;TeeVee Babe,&rdquo; 1999-2002, which paraded contestants in swimsuits and evening wear, produced 2001 runner-up winner Precious Lara Quigaman, who was crowned Miss International in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gay men had their share of fame in the comically packaged &ldquo;Super Sireyna&rdquo; (Super Mermaid), which began in 1995, and in its lampoon version &ldquo;Suffer Sireyna&rdquo; (Suffering Mermaid), 2014. &ldquo;Maid in the Philippines,&rdquo; the first and so far the only beauty contest for domestic helpers, was featured in 2009. Beginning in 2014, foreigners who have come to stay in the Philippines and adapted to Philippine culture in different ways have participated in &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my Foreignoy,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You&rsquo;re my Foreignay,&rdquo; a portmanteau of foreigner and &ldquo;Pinoy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pinay,&rdquo; the informal term for Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular segments also include those that offer cash and material prizes to their avid viewers. In the 1980s, &ldquo;Send in Your Dreams&rdquo; encouraged viewers to write letters detailing their special requests which the show selected and granted on-air. This preceded GMA&rsquo;s wish-granting TV program <b><i>Wish Ko Lang</i></b>. &ldquo;Lottong Bahay&rdquo; (Home-made or &ldquo;Syndicated&rdquo; Lottery), started in 1995, turned out to be the most popular variety show game: the program had to hold its grand finals at the Quezon City Memorial Circle to accommodate millions of entries. &ldquo;Meron o Wala&rdquo; (All or Nothing), 1999-2000, and &ldquo;Laban o Bawi&rdquo; (Wager or Take Back), beginning in 2000, offered top contestants risks of betting for the chance of a bigger prize in exchange for a tidy sum already won. These segments upped the ante of surprise and hope to studio viewers and fellow contestants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For many years now, the guessing game &ldquo;Pinoy Henyo&rdquo; (Filipino Genius), which started in 2004, has tested the analytical and encyclopedic knowledge of contestants and has since offered prizes to different categories of players, from representatives of grade and high schools and universities to officemates, family members, media personalities, and foreigners. &ldquo;Pinoy Henyo&rdquo; has become an essential game in parties and made variations in the composition of teams by having elderly-child and boyfriend-girlfriend tandems, and even a <i>barkada</i> (team) setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Perhaps the most innovative of all programs crafted in Philippine broadcast media, &ldquo;Juan for All, All for Juan&rdquo; has literally entered the homes of Filipinos from all walks of life. Each day the <b><i>EB</i></b> team visits a barangay (community) for its project of collecting recyclable garbage, which it uses to build chairs for public schools nationwide. Residents bring the requested items in addition to plastics for a chance to win bigger prizes. One resident drawn from a raffle is interviewed by hosts Manalo, Ballesteros, and Bayola inside the winner&rsquo;s house. The segment becomes hilarious as the trio and the studio hosts subject the winner to a lot of questions and respond to the unexpected extraordinary situations of the people and places they visit. Sometimes it showcases Manalo playing the role of the spirits of the dead loved ones of the winner-interviewees, Bayola eating whatever food is available, and Ballesteros making naughty faces and gestures, and all three lampooning the people involved in the segment, including behind-the-scene staff. Some of their most memorable episodes show the following: the main door of the winning contestant&rsquo;s house opening into a family&rsquo;s toilet, a mother interviewed on a crackling dilapidated roof, an abode under a bridge housing a family of stragglers, a diligent couple raising a family inside a public utility bus transformed into an accommodation that rivals hotel rooms, a seemingly unhinged person rebutting questions with crackling humor as he finishes the keychain which he then offers to the show&rsquo;s hosts in the studio, and a winning contestant interviewed in a seemingly drunken state as he awakens from sleep. Viewers-turned-winning contestants become gracious hosts who intimate their financial and familial problems to the public, many times bringing their audience to tears and often highlighting dignity in the midst of squalor. It has become the show&rsquo;s bread and butter as almost all the commercial advertisers funnel their sponsorships into the segment. More importantly, the segment broke the barriers of televisual space, with contestants in the barangay given extensive air time and becoming stars themselves as they interact with the hosts and even the audience in the studio. This segment spawned the highly phenomenal AlDub, the split-screen love team of young star Alden Richards and Dubsmash sensation Maine Mendoza aka Yaya Dub, which culminated in the show&rsquo;s 36th anniversary presentation titled &ldquo;Sa Tamang Panahon&rdquo; (At the Right Time), on 24 Oct 2015 at the Philippine Arena, with a record-breaking live audience of 55,000, with the highest number of tickets sold in less than three days, tweets reaching 41 million in 24 hours, much higher than the tweets of the 2014 World Cup semi-final match between Brazil and Germany, and its rival <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b>, ABS-CBN, admitting its defeat in the ratings game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many personalities trace their beginnings to <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b>, like Richie d&rsquo;Horsey, Lani Mercado, Plinky Recto, Ces Quesada, Christine Jacob, Alice Dixson, Cindy Kurleto, Kristine Florendo, Lalaine Edson, Lana Asanin, Leila Kuzma, Mickey Ferriols, Nadine Schmidt, Sherilyn Reyes, Tania Paulsen, Illac Diaz, and ABS-CBN hosts Toni Gonzaga and Iza Calzado. Rapper Francis Magalona devoted his last productive years with the <i>dabarkads</i> (from the word <i>barkada, </i>meaning, a group of friends), a term the hosts use to refer to their wacky group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dancers, usually relegated to sleaze, have also had their turn at popularity, like Gracia and Rochelle Pangilinan, who would have programs of their own. The program made popular The Sexbomb Dancers, EB Babes, and female and male Brazilian and Brapanese (Brazilian-Japanese) models. Common phrases, like &ldquo;Spaghetti, itaktak mo&rdquo; (Spaghetti, shake it off) and &ldquo;Kagat-labi&rdquo; (Bite One&rsquo;s Lip), coined with sexual innuendos by de Leon, have become popular for some of its audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The public has hurled numerous criticisms at the program, mainly for the &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; mode of comedy of its main hosts. In the 1980s, the show was subjected to stringent standards with regard to the dancers&rsquo; attire, treatment of contestants, camera angle, and vulgar and politically incorrect jokes on a person&rsquo;s age, face, and gender. Vic Sotto was criticized when he spat juice on the face of a child star in one episode of the segment &ldquo;Ang Joke Ko&rdquo; (My Joke), highlighting the slapstick brand of comedy with which the older generation of actors seem to have trouble dispensing. De Leon was also publicly castigated for making a joke on the murder of journalists. He was also suspended by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4910\"><strong>Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)</strong></a> when people were outraged by his below-the-belt teasing of a four-year-old contestant. &ldquo;Suffer Sireyna&rdquo; was criticized for its demeaning treatment of gay men. Bayola took a leave from the show when a video of his sexual relations with one of the show&rsquo;s dancers was leaked and scandalized the people. These responses by the general public make apparent that a popular show like <b><i>EB</i></b>, its hosts, and even a sector of its audiences can be challenged to seriously reflect on their brand of entertainment and the ethical and moral practices of all its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From time to time, <b><i>EB</i></b> faced tough competition from shows purposefully launched by other networks to dislodge the program from its supremacy. In 1987, just only a year after it started, <b><i>Lunch Date</i></b>, hosted by popular singer Randy Santiago, removed <b><i>EB</i></b> from its No. 1 spot but the show immediately recovered because of Aiza Seguerra&rsquo;s tremendous audience-drawing talent. In the early 2000s, the &ldquo;Pera o Bayong&rdquo; (Money or Bag) contest of <b><i>Magandang Tanghali Bayan </i></b>(Good Day My Country), again featuring Santiago as one of the hosts, toppled EB from its dominance of the noontime slot. <b><i>EB</i></b> responded by launching the &ldquo;Laban o Bawi&rdquo; (Wager or Take Back) game segment and regained its top rating. The formidable competition offered by ABS-CBN from <b><i>&lsquo;Sang Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b>, <b><i>Magandang Tanghali Bayan</i></b> (revitalized as <b><i>Masayang Tanghali Bayan</i></b> [Happy Day, My Country] and <b><i>MTB Ang Saya Saya</i></b>), and <b><i>Wowowee</i></b><i> </i>to <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b>, including <b><i>Willing-Willie</i></b>, later <b><i>Will Time Big Time</i></b> and <b><i>Wowowillie</i></b> on TV5, compels the show to adapt to rapidly changing demography and tastes of multimedia viewers. In particular, the hugely popular &ldquo;That&rsquo;s My Tomboy&rdquo; contest of rival <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b> compelled <b><i>EB</i> </b>to introduce &ldquo;That&rsquo;s My Tambay&rdquo; segment in the barangay for jobless persons. Even the institutional &ldquo;Little Miss Philippines&rdquo; had to be tweaked by involving parents in the competition when <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i> </b>started &ldquo;Mini-Me,&rdquo; with child contestants packaged as little versions of famous personalities. It also addresses the global and transnational orientation of media audiences through &ldquo;You&rsquo;re My Foreignoy/Foreignay&rdquo; and the international version of &ldquo;Super Sireyna&rdquo; for transgender people. The show was commended for featuring plus-size women in a positive light in the contest &ldquo;FHHM (For Healthy and Heavy Model),&rdquo; a pun on the men&rsquo;s magazine <b><i>FHM</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>and domestic helpers through the segment &ldquo;Maid in the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Lenten season, the program usually mounts a TV soap production showcasing the thespian abilities of its hosts, a departure from comedic to dramatic roles. It also organizes tours abroad, most notably in Singapore, Hong Kong, and North America, to personally keep in touch with Filipinos worldwide and a growing international audience. <b><i>EB</i></b> has been franchised by a leading television network in Indonesia, to which it exports all its contests and segments. It is expected that the show will endure as it continues to innovate and address the evolving and discriminating tastes and demands of local and foreign audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> won the best entertainment program for its silver anniversary episode in the Asian Television Awards in 2005. From the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4598\"><strong>Philippine Movie Press Club (PMPC)</strong></a>, the program received the Star Awards Hall of Fame for TV in 2009 for having won best variety program from 1987 to 2008; best variety program male hosts for either Tito, Vic, or Joey from 1989 to 2008 and for Allan K in 2010; and the PMPC <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4831\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/847\"><strong>Ading</strong></a> Fernando</strong></a> Lifetime Achievement Award for producer Tony Tuviera in 2010. From the Entertainment Press Society, the program won the Golden Screen Awards for best variety program in 2011, 2012, and 2013; outstanding TV host for a musical or variety show for de Leon and Pia Guanio in 2005, Vic Sotto in 2011, Julia Clarete in 2011 and 2013, and Ryan Agoncillo in 2013; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a> Lifetime Achievement Award for TVJ in 2011. From the Guillermo Mendoza Memorial Scholarship Foundation, the program won the Box Office Entertainment Awards as most popular TV noontime musical variety show in 2012, 2013, and 2014; a Hall of Fame Award in 2008 as most popular dance group for the program&rsquo;s Sex Bomb Dancers for having won from 2002 to 2007, and most popular dance group for EB Babes in 2008 and 2009.

The switch to domestic satellite (domsat) broadcast that provided nationwide live coverage of a program, beginning on 18 May 1982, coupled by the co-hosting launch of pretty and popular Coney Reyes, who was also ousted from <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>, paved the way for the show&#x2019;s dominance of its time slot.

In 1980, it initiated the contest &#x201C;Mr. Macho&#x201D; for the promotion of the film <b><i>You Can&#x2019;t Stop the Music</i></b> starring the Village People. This was the first time that the program won the ratings game against <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>, gaining 31% against the latter&#x2019;s 29%. &#x201C;Little Miss Philippines,&#x201D; undeniably the most popular segment that was launched in 1984, jumpstarted the media career of Aiza Seguerra, a runner-up winner in 1987 who dazzled millions of viewers with her wit and crazy antics, such as the &#x201C;duck walk&#x201D; and &#x201C;acheche&#x201D; (an expression of surprise or incredulity rendered in a funny way), and Ryzza Mae Dizon, the title holder in 2012 who amuses audiences with her mature takes on various topics.

It also opened doors for the showbiz careers of Danilo Barrios, 1998 winner, who became a member of a popular dance group, and Edgar Allan Guzman, 2006 winner, who established his career as an actor in indie movies. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s My Boy&#x201D; for young boys, which began in 1991, introduced child actor Atong Redillas and BJ Forbes, while &#x201C;She&#x2019;s Got the Look&#x201D; for ladies, 1991-95, discovered actor  <strong><a href=\"/4/26/4637\"></a><a href=\"/4/26/4637\"><strong>Rosanna Roces</strong></a></strong> who initially won its daily round but lost the weekly finals.

Residents bring the requested items in addition to plastics for a chance to win bigger prizes. One resident drawn from a raffle is interviewed by hosts Manalo, Ballesteros, and Bayola inside the winner&#x2019;s house. The segment becomes hilarious as the trio and the studio hosts subject the winner to a lot of questions and respond to the unexpected extraordinary situations of the people and places they visit. Sometimes it showcases Manalo playing the role of the spirits of the dead loved ones of the winner-interviewees, Bayola eating whatever food is available, and Ballesteros making naughty faces and gestures, and all three lampooning the people involved in the segment, including behind-the-scene staff. Some of their most memorable episodes show the following: the main door of the winning contestant&#x2019;s house opening into a family&#x2019;s toilet, a mother interviewed on a crackling dilapidated roof, an abode under a bridge housing a family of stragglers, a diligent couple raising a family inside a public utility bus transformed into an accommodation that rivals hotel rooms, a seemingly unhinged person rebutting questions with crackling humor as he finishes the keychain which he then offers to the show&#x2019;s hosts in the studio, and a winning contestant interviewed in a seemingly drunken state as he awakens from sleep.

In the early 2000s, the &#x201C;Pera o Bayong&#x201D; (Money or Bag) contest of <b><i>Magandang Tanghali Bayan </i></b>(Good Day My Country), again featuring Santiago as one of the hosts, toppled EB from its dominance of the noontime slot. <b><i>EB</i></b> responded by launching the &#x201C;Laban o Bawi&#x201D; (Wager or Take Back) game segment and regained its top rating. The formidable competition offered by ABS-CBN from <b><i>&#x2018;Sang Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b>, <b><i>Magandang Tanghali Bayan</i></b> (revitalized as <b><i>Masayang Tanghali Bayan</i></b> [Happy Day, My Country] and <b><i>MTB Ang Saya Saya</i></b>), and <b><i>Wowowee</i></b><i> </i>to <b><i>It&#x2019;s Showtime</i></b>, including <b><i>Willing-Willie</i></b>, later <b><i>Will Time Big Time</i></b> and <b><i>Wowowillie</i></b> on TV5, compels the show to adapt to rapidly changing demography and tastes of multimedia viewers. In particular, the hugely popular &#x201C;That&#x2019;s My Tomboy&#x201D; contest of rival <b><i>It&#x2019;s Showtime</i></b> compelled <b><i>EB</i> </b>to introduce &#x201C;That&#x2019;s My Tambay&#x201D; segment in the barangay for jobless persons. Even the institutional &#x201C;Little Miss Philippines&#x201D; had to be tweaked by involving parents in the competition when <b><i>It&#x2019;s Showtime</i> </b>started &#x201C;Mini-Me,&#x201D; with child contestants packaged as little versions of famous personalities. It also addresses the global and transnational orientation of media audiences through &#x201C;You&#x2019;re My Foreignoy/Foreignay&#x201D; and the international version of &#x201C;Super Sireyna&#x201D; for transgender people. The show was commended for featuring plus-size women in a positive light in the contest &#x201C;FHHM (For Healthy and Heavy Model),&#x201D; a pun on the men&#x2019;s magazine <b><i>FHM</i></b><i>,<b> </b></i>and domestic helpers through the segment &#x201C;Maid in the Philippines.&#x201D;"

When they landed in a strange, barren place, they made it their own and named it Encantadia. The gods created different species of enchanted creatures (<i>encantados</i>) to inhabit the land: the <i>diwata</i> of Lireo, the <i>sapiryan</i> of Sapiro, the prairies or little creatures of Adamya, and the blacksmiths of Hathoria. At first, the relationship among the three <i>bathala</i> was civil, but when Arde and Ether fell in love&mdash;a violation of the rules of their exile&mdash;Emre cursed both of them and left Encantadia afterwards.

Driven by greed, the Hathorian king Arvak claimed all the gems for himself, but Prince Raquim of Sapiro took the gems back and gave them to Lireo to be kept safely.

Alena, the kind-hearted and compassionate one, became keeper of the gem of water. She can influence the movement of water and even summon a storm. Lastly, Danaya, the youngest of all, became keeper of the gem of earth.

Corrales would always start the show with the song &ldquo;A Million Thanks To You,&rdquo; which would become her trademark. She introduced and interviewed local and foreign composers, singers, and stars. She rendered interpretations of music in English, Spanish, Cebuano, and Tagalog with her trademark back-bending and hip-bending movements wearing skin tight, fully beaded gowns. She also entertained request numbers, and engaged audiences with her Visayan sense of humor. The show offered nine songs an episode. The heart of the show was Pilita&rsquo;s performance with the singing group Lemons Three, composed of Nikki Ross, Angie Yoingco, and director Villareal, who performed serious and comedy songs. The Lemons Three was also known as the Wing Duo whenever Villareal did not sing with Ross and Yoingco. The program ended with her singing the compositions or songs made popular by her guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>An Evening with Pilita</i></b> was considered the prestige program of ABS-CBN. The show always carried a theme, much like a storyline in a drama series. It was one of the first shows on local television to explore the medium of television to the fullest, especially in editing, lighting, and production design. It was the first Filipino show on television to be taped, using two Ampex videotape recorders bought by the network for the program. The show regularly had the &ldquo;Three Pilitas,&rdquo; a split-screen image of a Visayan Pilita, an English Pilita, and a Spanish Pilita, each speaking to one another, an editing technique first seen on local television at a time of analog broadcast production. Lavish sets, novel lighting, and a fabulous wardrobe enhanced the sophistication of the program. It was the first TV program to be videotaped in color in 1969, which changed as well the color schemes of the design of the studio and the wardrobe and makeup of Corrales and her guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Corrales, her guests, and the program&rsquo;s crew received the highest talent fees during the period. Her weekly one-hour performance rate for the show was 990 pesos. The program was rating well and was consistently one of ABS-CBN&rsquo;s top shows when Corrales decided to stop doing it to concentrate on her singing commitments outside the country. Corrales, however, continued to do specials for ABS-CBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>An Evening with Pilita</i></b> was revived as a one-airing special on 7 Oct 1977, Monday, 8:30-9:30 pm, on GMA. Directed again by Villareal, it showcased performances by Corrales with guest Rico Puno who aped each other&rsquo;s gestures and contortions on a duet, with children Jackie Lou and Ramoncito, and with long-time friend Amado in a duet of Latin American songs. The special also featured a nostalgic browse through Corrales&rsquo; souvenir photo albums, a lively song-and-dance number with the group Something Special, and a full-costume rendition of the <b><i>West Side Story</i></b> by the choral group The Ambivalent Crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1988, <b><i>An Evening with Pilita</i></b> returned under the same name, a monthly two-hour musical special, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2563\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2563\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2563\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\"><strong>Al Quinn</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>.

The show explored a variety of active lifestyle practices and immersed itself in the many possibilities in the world of sports by participating in the actual adventures themselves. In the show&rsquo;s 13-year run, the set of hosts tasked to bring the action to the viewers were instrumental to the show&rsquo;s innovative treatment and intense feel. Five sets of hosting changes from 1995 to 2008 did not affect the format of the show.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The show focused mainly on an active and healthy lifestyle. It was divided into segments tackling different topics each. The segments featured the hosts trying out traditional and extreme sports or discussing current trends and lifestyles but with a fresher and deeper angle. Proof of <b><i>Gameplan</i></b>&rsquo;s success and reach was the catchphrase it popularized.

The two soaps aired within a week of each other, both on DZRH from 1949, with <b><i>Ilaw</i></b> airing first. Both were scheduled to air at the same time but a delay in the casting of <b><i>Gulong</i></b> moved the airing of its premier episode.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The soap is premised on the love story of Carding, from a wealthy family, and Luisa, the daughter of a laundrywoman.

It then aired in 1992 on ABS-CBN under Millard Productions, and after 52 episodes became a station-produced program beginning on Sep 1993 until 1999. It had a short run from 2003 to 2004 on RPN 9, and aired again beginning on 10 Nov 2012 under Big Top Entertainment on GMA News TV. The TV program is one of the country&rsquo;s longest-running and top-rating drama anthologies. It showcases everyday lives of Filipinos based on court decisions involving the Family Code, and labor, criminal, and civil laws. It is a unique legal show because the stories dramatized are based on facts determined by the courts from actual trials and not on pending cases. Common cases include love triangles, squabbles among heirs over inheritance, infidelity, adultery, concubinage, marriage annulment, rape, incest involving fathers and daughters, child adoption, employer-employee relations, unfair labor practices, and illegal dismissals. The legal answers to the situations do not come from the opinion of the host lawyer but from the decisions of the Supreme Court, which are already considered part of the law of the land. Sison featured the cases not in legal jargon but in a language that could easily be understood by the common people.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The concept of the program came from newscaster Jose Mari Velez who saw the potential of Sison&rsquo;s newspaper column &ldquo;A Law Each Day&rdquo; in <b><i>The Philippine Star</i></b>. The column was the idea of the paper&rsquo;s publisher and founding chairperson Betty Go-Belmonte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ipaglaban Mo</i></b>&rsquo;s initial episode, &ldquo;Haligi ng Tahanan&rdquo; (Pillar of the House), starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4459\"><strong>Richard Gomez</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4300\"><strong>Dina Bonnevie</strong></a> under directors Peque Gallaga and Lorenzo Reyes, was about the custody battle between the wealthy grandparents and the poor father of a child whose mother died while giving birth. The father won the case and the rich parents continued supporting the child. The second episode featured <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4487\"><strong>Jaclyn Jose</strong></a>, Jimmy Santos, and Tirso Cruz III and was directed by Carlos Siguion-Reyna. Nick Lizaso, who was a commissioner of the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, directed most of the program&rsquo;s subsequent episodes on IBC 13 and ABS-CBN. Dante Nico Garcia and Hero Bautista, son of movie director and former Quezon City councilor Butch Bautista and brother of actors Harlene and Quezon City Mayor Herbert, took over the directing job in its run on GMA News TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The show became so popular that it spawned a daily five-minute legal vignette, &ldquo;Ikaw at ang Batas&rdquo; (You and the Law), shown during the daily 5:00 pm news program of IBC 13. When the show transferred to ABS-CBN, the show&rsquo;s <b><i>Ikaw at ang Batas</i></b> (You and the Law) became a segment of the daily evening news <b><i>Hoy Gising </i></b>(Hey, Wake Up).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ikaw at ang Batas </i></b>is now a daily TV program on NBN4, 2008-present, and a public service program on DZRJ. <b><i>Ipaglaban Mo</i></b> also gave birth to two movies, 1995 and 1997, written by Ricky Lee and produced by ABS-CBN&rsquo;s sister company, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\"><strong>Star Cinema</strong></a>.

The legal answers to the situations do not come from the opinion of the host lawyer but from the decisions of the Supreme Court, which are already considered part of the law of the land. Sison featured the cases not in legal jargon but in a language that could easily be understood by the common people."

It aired a total of 405 episodes in its 17-year run on Philippine television.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sitcom reflects in a humorous way the life of the typical working class family. Each episode revolves around John Puruntong striving to get his family by. He is the happy-go-lucky family man who does not take life seriously as long as the family lives happily under one roof. John&rsquo;s patient wife, Marsha, sheds her elite origins, puts on her squatter-area duster, and holds nothing against life in spite of their poverty. Their teenaged son, Rolly, is content in having girls constantly swooning over him, while daughter, Shirley, is often engrossed in her school assignments. John keeps on refusing to accept financial help offered by his wealthy, overweight, condescending mother-in-law Do&ntilde;a Delilah, whose sidekick help, Matutina, scrutinizes every nook and cranny of John&rsquo;s dilapidated house. Once in a while, neighborhood store keeper and Shirley&rsquo;s suitor, Isko, pays John&rsquo;s family a visit. Each episode ends with Do&ntilde;a Delilah humorously insulting John and screaming her advice to her financially challenged son-in-law, &ldquo;Kaya ikaw, John, magsumikap ka!&rdquo; (So, John, try even harder!), which became a household catchphrase among audiences of the period.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For many audiences and some critics, the show inspired optimism among viewers on their personal situation and provided comic relief to Filipinos during the time of martial law. Others, however, believe that the caricature of economically poor Filipinos as lazy or not industrious enough to make both ends meet, particularly in the case of John Puruntong, discounts institutional and structural deficiencies in Philippine society that render them poor in the first place, almost always barred from opportunities to rise above their conditions, and only shifts the blame on fate and the individual rather than on the responsibility of the government to provide the citizens with basic social services. Other common criticisms against the show are its paper-thin predictable plots, extended and dragging sequences, old tricks that rely heavily on enthusiastic acting rather than on characterization, sloppy directing, and simplistic solutions to the impoverished life of Filipinos living then under conditions of martial rule.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The success of <b><i>John en Marsha</i></b>, in terms of audience reception and commercial success in the ratings game, has made it a template for succeeding family sitcoms. Dolphy starred in similar sitcoms such as <b><i>Home along da <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1272\"><strong>Riles</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Home along the Railroad), 1992-2003, and a sequel entitled <b><i>Home along da Airport</i></b><i> </i>(Home along the Airport), 2003-05, both on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a></strong></a>, that presented humorous day-to-day experiences of poor families of informal settlers.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sitcom later on produced nine movie sequels:<i> <b>JohnenMarshasa Pelikula</b></i><b></b>(John and Marsha in a movie), 1974; <b><i>JohnenMarsha Part Two</i><i>sa Amerika</i></b>(John and Marsha Part Two in America), 1975;<i> <b>JohnenMarsha &lsquo;77</b></i> (John and Marsha &rsquo;77), 1977<i>; <b>JohnenMarsha &lsquo;80</b></i> (John and Marsha &rsquo;80) 1980<i>; <b>DaBest of JohnenMarsha</b></i><b> </b>(The Best of John and Marsha), 1983<i>; <b>DaBest of JohnenMarsha 2</b></i> (The Best of John and Marsha 2), 1984<i>; <b>JohnenMarsha &lsquo;85sa Probinsya</b></i>(John and Marsha in the Province), 1985<i>; <b>JohnenMarsha T.N.T.sa Amerika</b></i>, (John and Marsha T.N.T. in America), 1986<i>; </i>and <b><i>JohnenMarshaNgayong&lsquo;91</i></b> (John and Marsha this 1991), 1991.

				"value": "The sitcom reflects in a humorous way the life of the typical working class family. Each episode revolves around John Puruntong striving to get his family by. He is the happy-go-lucky family man who does not take life seriously as long as the family lives happily under one roof. John&#x2019;s patient wife, Marsha, sheds her elite origins, puts on her squatter-area duster, and holds nothing against life in spite of their poverty. Their teenaged son, Rolly, is content in having girls constantly swooning over him, while daughter, Shirley, is often engrossed in her school assignments. John keeps on refusing to accept financial help offered by his wealthy, overweight, condescending mother-in-law Do&#xF1;a Delilah, whose sidekick help, Matutina, scrutinizes every nook and cranny of John&#x2019;s dilapidated house. Once in a while, neighborhood store keeper and Shirley&#x2019;s suitor, Isko, pays John&#x2019;s family a visit. Each episode ends with Do&#xF1;a Delilah humorously insulting John and screaming her advice to her financially challenged son-in-law, &#x201C;Kaya ikaw, John, magsumikap ka!&#x201D; (So, John, try even harder!), which became a household catchphrase among audiences of the period.<br>\n"

				"value": "For many audiences and some critics, the show inspired optimism among viewers on their personal situation and provided comic relief to Filipinos during the time of martial law. Others, however, believe that the caricature of economically poor Filipinos as lazy or not industrious enough to make both ends meet, particularly in the case of John Puruntong, discounts institutional and structural deficiencies in Philippine society that render them poor in the first place, almost always barred from opportunities to rise above their conditions, and only shifts the blame on fate and the individual rather than on the responsibility of the government to provide the citizens with basic social services. Other common criticisms against the show are its paper-thin predictable plots, extended and dragging sequences, old tricks that rely heavily on enthusiastic acting rather than on characterization, sloppy directing, and simplistic solutions to the impoverished life of Filipinos living then under conditions of martial rule.<br>\n"

Lyka works as an assistant to fashion designer Eleanor Blancaflor at the House of Elle, hoping one day to become a designer herself. Behind her delicate and sensuous exterior is a dark secret: Lyka is a werewolf and is involved with the Waya, the protector and defender of the werewolf race.

He had submitted the script, and eventually won in a BBC competition on the environment. Brocka, however, died in a vehicular accident on 21 May 1991 in the middle of the project&rsquo;s preproduction. The producers approached Mel to work on the project.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The movie drama-for-TV chronicles the real story of a Filipino woman and her family who leave their fishing village in Bataan in Central Luzon after an oil spill and move to a community in the outskirts of Manila. It presents the strong willed mother, Lucia, struggling to keep her family together in the midst of terrorism, crime, corruption, and the never-ending threat of eviction from their community. It narrates the passionate effort and pains of the mother to keep her children from falling prey to the dangerous life of the city.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several social forces, however, make her powerless and eventually force her and her family to move to the slums in the heart of Manila. The last sequence is a powerful scene of a family walking toward Smokey Mountain, the epitome and symbol of poverty during the Marcos dictatorship.

The stories revolve around domestic issues, life choices, and the unforgettable struggles of Filipinos. The drama conveys hopeful messages such as love of God, faith in the family, and values like resilience, courage, and joyfulness. Episodes of the drama are always inspirational, making sure that good always triumphs over evil in spite of the characters&rsquo; difficult circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Each episode begins with a letter reading by the host, followed by the narrative. The host periodically appears in between sequences, reading the letter, which provides the continuity of the sequences. Each episode ends with the host providing anecdotes and insights from the dramatized experiences of the letter sender. The show&rsquo;s theme music is based on the popular <i>habanera</i> of the same title, originally composed by renowned music artist Constancio de Guzman for the movie of the same title, 1954, and first sung for the program by Dulce, then by Carol Banawa beginning in the early 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The creation of <b><i>MMK</i></b> began in 1988 when Santos-Concio signed film director Lino Brocka to do a 13-part drama series for ABS-CBN. Brocka managed to finish only three episodes because of his untimely death in 1991. The network decided to air the three dramas in 1991, with <b><i>MMK</i></b> as the show&rsquo;s title. Since the episodes got rave reviews from critics, the station decided to continue producing the series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first episode, &ldquo;Rubber Shoes,&rdquo; was about a young student who is ashamed of his poor origins.

Mara grew up as the kind-hearted daughter of poverty-stricken parents Gary and Susan Davis, while Clara&mdash;the real daughter of the Davis couple&mdash;became the spoiled child of the good-natured Amanthe and Almira del Valle, Mara&rsquo;s biological parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The benevolent Del Valle couple takes Mara in as their housemaid, even paying for her education, not knowing that she is their real daughter. Contrary to the good nature of her parents, Clara constantly abuses Mara. At the same time, Mara is also being maltreated by her father Gary, who only uses her so that he can gain money from the Del Valles.

Marcelino is an abandoned, naughty boy raised by Franciscan friars. He discovers a life-sized image of the crucified Christ in a prohibited place in the monastery, an image he does not recognize as that of the Lord. He pities the suffering Man, whom he offers bread and wine in his subsequent visits. The statue takes and eats the bread given him by Marcelino.

He withdraws from people, yet is mischievous in some instances. In his imaginative encounters with Christ, the narrative blurs the line between the imagined and the real, leaving the viewers to decide whether the story is a myth or a miracle. The elegiac narrative, as described by Torre sets up the emotionally touching sequences of the drama, especially that of a patient who teaches the boy about motherly love, an emotion unfamiliar to the child, and the farewell sequence between Marcelino and the friar who found and adopted him. The program used locations, such as the Sacred Heart Novitiate, Letran College, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\"><strong>Santo Domingo Church</strong></a>, to create an atmosphere that highlights or contrasts with Marcelino&rsquo;s longing for the affection of a mother.

The plot revolves around an orphaned boy named Santino (Jaranilla) who can converse with &ldquo;Bro,&rdquo; a mysterious voice that provides him with supernatural powers to cure the sick, heal internal conflicts, and help resolve domestic disputes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The series is set in a fictional town called Barangay Pag-asa (Village of Hope), a direct reference to the drama&rsquo;s religious intents. The story opens with a woman named Teresa Malimban leaving her baby boy, who later turns out to be Santino, in a cemetery. A groundskeeper finds the infant and brings it to a monastery under the care of Father Anthony, the chief administrator, Father Ringo, a former social butterfly who decided to become a priest, and Father Jose, who serves as the cook and father figure to the boy. Santino develops close relationships and finds maternal love with police officer Selda, who is the daughter of Do&ntilde;a Anita who left her rich family for Mario, also a policeman whose righteous deeds keep the town&rsquo;s peace and order. The town is run by the power-hungry Mayor Enrique Rodrigo, whose wealthy wife, Malena, happens to be the older sister of Selda. Malena had killed Santino&rsquo;s mother. After a series of healings and life-threatening events, it will be revealed that Santino&rsquo;s biological father is the town mayor. At the end of the series, Tilde, the mayor&rsquo;s mistress and second wife, accidentally pushes Santino down a flight of stairs, which causes the death of the boy. Santino&rsquo;s death is reminiscent of the way Santino&rsquo;s mother died at the hands of the mayor&rsquo;s first wife Malena, and how Malena will die at the hands of Tilde. After seeing both his parents in the afterlife, Santino is brought back to life to continue his mission of bringing hope to the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The series featured a powerhouse cast of guest actors for its episodes, which included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\"><strong>Gloria Romero</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\"><strong>Susan Roces</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4403\"><strong>Johnny Delgado</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4703\"><strong>Lorna Tolentino</strong></a>, Christopher de Leon, John Estrada, Vhong Navarro, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Mylene Dizon</strong></a></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4673\"><strong>Judy Ann Santos</strong></a>, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4753\"><strong>Ryan Agoncillo</strong></a></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\"><strong>Charo Santos</strong></a>-Concio. This strategy helped increase its viewership. Because of its high ratings, ABS-CBN extended its initial eight-week run to 20 weeks and extended it again until its last episode after a year of daily broadcast.

Unwilling to live with her mother, Grace, accompanied by Santino, runs away from home and goes to her grandfather Pilo who is living in a home for the aged. Panic intensifies in the monastery and the feud between Grace&rsquo;s parents intensifies. The police conduct a search for the children and track them down to an old house where negotiations become heated until snipers target Pilo&rsquo;s head.

Slowly, she is able to recover from her trauma and manages to enter into a love relationship with her co-worker in the touch therapy. Melinda and Rose meet a few years later. Rose continues to deny that she was raped. She later witnesses the capture of two of their comrades, an incident which unsettles her. Rose finally admits to Melinda that she was indeed raped during their capture. She reveals to Melinda that she had aborted the child which was the result of her tragic ordeal. Rose cannot get over her traumatic experience and sensed her life at a standstill. She is unable to weather the psychological trauma of rape. She eventually commits suicide."

The drama is narrated through the voice-over of Lally, whose husband, Vincent Soriano turns out to be a closeted gay man who forced himself into a heterosexual marriage. His mother Elaine, a conservative religious socialite, and his father Armando, a strict and homophobic retired army general, compounds Vincent&rsquo;s dilemma. Lally&rsquo;s mother Sandra constantly reminds her of their struggles after her philandering husband Galo left them for another woman.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lally is a fulltime housewife, while Vincent runs his car dealership business. The couple and their children, Diego and Hannah, are living in the Soriano mansion. All is well until the couple decides to have their own house, and commissions Eric del Mundo as the architect. It turns out that Eric, who has just arrived home after years of staying in the United States, is Vincent&rsquo;s high school sweetheart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vincent and Eric rekindle their interrupted romance, keeping their affair from Lally. The characters are not without their &ldquo;consciences&rdquo; in the person of Vincent&rsquo;s gay friend and ex-lover David and Eric&rsquo;s artist mother Sol. Lally has her best friend Vicky as her sounding board, who tells her about the affair but not about Vincent&rsquo;s sexual orientation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first half of the narrative centers on the development of the affair of Vincent and Eric, showing how two men could have a real, authentic, and loving relationship, minus the stereotypical gender roles. The narrative emphasizes that a homosexual relationship, like any heterosexual relationship, also has drama, happiness, love, sadness, struggles, romanticism, obstacles, and victories. The latter half of the show deals with Vincent&rsquo;s coming-out struggles, punctuated by Lally&rsquo;s cliffhanger discovery of her husband&rsquo;s orientation, the individual reaction of Vincent&rsquo;s parents on the coming-out issue, and the father&rsquo;s warped machismo-laden dealings of his homophobia. Elaine gradually accepts her son&rsquo;s orientation, but Armando resists his son&rsquo;s gayness, and taps his military connections to have Vincent abducted and detained to undergo a 45-day military training to rid him of his gayness. This leads to Vincent&rsquo;s suicide attempt that, in the end, shakes the family&rsquo;s prejudices against homosexuality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The drama portrays various gay characters and their respective dilemmas. David is a non-effeminate restaurateur who does not have any qualms about coming out. Eric&rsquo;s semi-effeminate gay best friend Danny, who is openly gay, harbors a grudge against his mother who rejects his plan of moving in with his boyfriend and who views gay men as financial providers for less fortunate family members. Zandro/Zsa Zsa Soriano is Vincent&rsquo;s older cousin who is a transgender woman, whose character provides another homophobic plot point for the Soriano family. The presence of the transgender character provides a good chance to explain the different nuances of the gay and transgender divide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>My Husband</i></b><i>&rsquo;<b>s Lover </b></i>has some portrayals with contentious implications. Infecting the womanizing Armando with the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV suggests that the disease is a form of punishment for the homophobic. David&rsquo;s decision to adopt a scavenger woman&rsquo;s unwanted baby, then falling for the scavenger herself, shunning his boyfriend in the process, traps him within the bounds of the nuclear family. When Vincent punches and hurts Eric who taunts him for his self-closetedness, the show raises the possibilities of physical violence in gay relationships. When Eric readily forgives Vincent for the assault, the narrative seems to suggest that simple remorse can easily absolve anyone who commits physical violence against a person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The show managed to engage various audiences. The lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community actively supported the program by providing its creators a critique of the drama and suggesting storylines to improve the narrative. Perhaps because of this engagement, the show wrapped up the program by serving storylines that catered to both the straight and the LGBTQs. Lally and Vincent get their marriage annulled, yet they continue to be a family, albeit in different abodes, and respect the needs of their rearranged relationship. Their children mature and learn to understand their parents&rsquo; situation. Eric sacrifices his love, leaves for the US but stays in touch with Lally as a friend. Vincent sets Lally up with Sam, a former client, implying a foreboding romance. Vincent remains single, but a rekindled romance is introduced when he runs again into Eric who returns home to put up his architecture business. In this ending, no character is unnecessarily antagonized, no sexual orientation is misjudged, and those who seek redemption get what they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>My Husband</i></b><i>&rsquo;<b>s Lover </b></i>received a plaque of appreciation from the Malate Business Association in 2013.

Rizal, the television drama consists of 13 episodes, each running for about 50 minutes. The television drama, which is part of a long history of adaptations of the <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b> (1887), restructures the original novel and comments on the theme of Rizal&rsquo;s work.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first episode introduces the protagonist, Crisostomo Ibarra, a learned man who comes from a wealthy <i>mestizo</i> family and who has just returned from his studies in Europe to establish a school in his town for the enlightenment of the youth. The second episode highlights the poor life of Sisa. The third episode presents a series of vignettes in the town, while the fourth highlights the wisdom of Pilosopo Tasyo. The fifth up to the last episode unravel a series of events that lead to the unfortunate shattering of Ibarra&rsquo;s dream of reforming society through education. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the workers dies during the groundbreaking ceremonies for the school he is building. In a dinner, he earns the ire of the powerful Padre Damaso, whom Ibarra nearly kills for insulting the memory of his father. Ibarra is excommunicated, friends turn their backs on him, and his marriage to the mestiza Maria Clara is called off. He is unjustly implicated by Padre Salvi in an unsuccessful plot of rebellion against the government, but he escapes colonial authorities with the help of the loyal Elias, a man whom his family had oppressed and whom he once saved during a picnic on the lake. Basilio, one of Sisa&rsquo;s sons, flees the wrath of another friar and eventually meets his dying mother, who has lost her sanity. Elias is shot to death while protecting Ibarra. Maria Clara, upon learning that she is the illegitimate daughter of Padre Damaso, enters the convent to become a nun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The drama, like Rizal&rsquo;s novel, examines notions of identity as they are played out in the characters of the <i>indio </i>(native), the <i>mestizo</i>, and the Chinese, who all experience different forms of discrimination. It critiques the corruption and hypocrisy of the church hierarchy. And it explores how the colonizer and the colonized are both accountable for the oppressiveness and backwardness of Philippine colonial society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While ostensibly following the narrative of the novel in its depiction of fin-de-si&egrave;cle life in the Philippines under the rule of the Spanish empire and the Roman Catholic clergy, the television miniseries departs from Rizal&rsquo;s key plot and descriptive points, thereby updating the theme of the story for contemporary viewers. The drama opens with the motif of darkness and raging storms, which Rizal employs extensively in his fiction, but it ends with the brightness of a new day, which is contrary to Rizal&rsquo;s conclusion. Whereas Rizal ends the novel tragically and ironically, with the final chapter entitled &ldquo;Christmas Eve,&rdquo; segueing to the sequel, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1891, the television miniseries ends on a hopeful note, with the final episode titled, &ldquo;Pasko at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2133\"><strong>Bagong Taon</strong></a>&rdquo; (Christmas and New Year).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the adaptation, Ibarra does not disappear, in order to transmogrify into the diabolical Simoun in <b><i>El Filibusterismo</i></b>. He is instead shown to have survived and ready to start anew, a denouement that cancels the need for a sequel. Remembering the lost lives of Sisa and Elias, Ibarra gives Basilio the charge to keep the dream of transforming society alive, not only through an abstract notion of education but by living for others and paying forward his debt of gratitude to the dearly departed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The narration is omniscient, unfolding in a linear timeline. The music sometimes works as a counterpoint, as in the sequence where Damaso&rsquo;s impassioned sermon is embedded with a score that sounds like a dirge, signifying defeat or an ominous foreshadowing of future events. The realistic production design represents a lowland Christian town in the 19th century. The theatrical staging and gestures of actors inject a period feel to the dramatic composition of the scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The television series was produced during the decade of the Centennial of Philippine Revolution. It won the Best Culture and Arts Program prize in the 15th KBP Golden Dove Awards in 1993.

It veers away from traditional studio setups, a practice of earlier productions, and always goes on location to create a cinematic television experience for the audience. The title of the drama series was inspired by the song of the same title popularized by composer and singer Rey Valera and which was also used as the teleserye&rsquo;s theme music.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This 40-minute daily soap opera is the story of two generations of lovers in the fictional town of Punta Verde. The first story is between Amor de Jesus and Eduardo Buenavista. Amor, a country lass, works as a helper in the Buenavista mansion. Eduardo and Amor fall in love, to the dismay of the Buenavista matriarch Do&ntilde;a Benita. With Eduardo&rsquo;s brother Diego, Do&ntilde;a Benita plots to besmear Amor&rsquo;s purity in the eyes of Eduardo, and they succeed. Amor is banished from the hacienda and lives with her mother Chayong in the Payatas dumpsite in Manila. Later, without Eduardo&rsquo;s knowledge, she gives birth to Eduardo&rsquo;s child whom she names Maria Amor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Back in the mansion, Do&ntilde;a Benita, beset with financial problems, tries to save the hacienda, by marrying off her son Eduardo to Claudia Zalamea, the daughter of another rich landowner and politician. But unknown to her and her son, Claudia is already pregnant with the child of her first love, Simon Barcial. Later, Claudia and Eduardo have two children, the rebellious Angelo and the devout Lia, who later dies of cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To support her daughter, Amor ends up dancing in a girly bar where she meets Mr. Powers, an American businessman, who later marries her and brings her to the US. He tells Amor to leave the daughter behind with her mother in the dumpsite. From the US, Amor sends her daughter money, while quietly suffering marital abuse. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> stormy night, the dumpsite collapses (alluding to a similar tragic event in real life Payatas). Aling Chayong dies from the accident, but, unknown to Amor, her daughter survives the tragedy and is found by the couple Belen and Isko Macaspac. Amor witnesses the tragedy on TV and pleads with Mr. Powers to send her back home, but she is refused and further battered. One day, Mr. Powers suffers a stroke, never to recover. The vengeful Amor allows her husband to wither away in pain, while she waits to collect her fortune. After he dies, she returns to the country, embodying a new personality expressed in her name: &ldquo;Amor Powers.&rdquo; Filled with rage, she returns to exact vengeance on everyone who caused all of her suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, the Macaspac couple adopts the girl they saved and names her Ynamorata or Yna, after the signature in the sketch of a woman they found beside her (it was Eduardo&rsquo;s sketch of Amor, in happier times). Yna grows up into a fine young girl. By a stroke of luck and due to the appearance to her in dreams of a repentant Do&ntilde;a Benita, she finds herself working at the Buenavista hacienda&mdash;like her mother before her. As in the previous generation, Yna also falls in love with the master&rsquo;s son, Angelo, and vice versa. Their love, however, is suppressed by Claudia, now called Madame Claudia, who scorns Yna&rsquo;s poverty. Even so, Angelo would always defend Yna, a far cry from Eduardo who was easily swayed by his mother&rsquo;s ploys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon the wealthy and influential Amor Powers returns to Punta Verde to look for her missing daughter, and to engineer the downfall of the Buenavistas, who by now are already well placed in government and business. Eduardo is now provincial governor. As the governor&rsquo;s wife, Madame Claudia is notorious for her corrupt practices and involvement in illegal gambling. Madame Claudia now feels threatened by Amor&rsquo;s presence, because she knows of Amor&rsquo;s past romance with Eduardo. Amor uses her charm and money to gain economic and political ascendancy over the Buenavistas, setting the occasions for the soap&rsquo;s most unforgettable and quotable confrontation scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amor&rsquo;s search for her daughter leads her to an old woman, Aling Puring, who raised a girl named Maria Amor. It turns out that Maria Amor is the daughter of Claudia, switched at birth with another baby in the hospital, the boy who would grow up to be Angelo, upon the instructions of Do&ntilde;a Benita who preferred a male heir. The girl, also known as Clarissa, is Claudia&rsquo;s love child with Simon. Not knowing the truth and as a way of getting back at Amor, Claudia, who believes that Clarissa is Amor&rsquo;s child, subjects the girl to abuse and eventually kills her, a crime for which she would be punished later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, the realization that Maria Amor (Yna) and Angelo are children of the same father now presents an obstacle to the consummation of the love story between the two lovers. However, witnesses attest that Angelo was sired not by Eduardo but by his brother Diego with an unknown woman, making him Eduardo&rsquo;s nephew. Later, Diego is further revealed as an adopted son of Do&ntilde;a Benita. After Claudia&rsquo;s crime and all the revelations, Eduardo abandons Claudia for Amor. Yna and Angelo&rsquo;s wedding is set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Claudia&rsquo;s anger, however, cannot be contained, now aggravated by guilt after discovering that she had killed her own daughter. With her loyal assistant Coring, she plots to kill the Buenavistas during the wedding, but Lia and Angelo plead with her to stop the violence and learn how to forgive and change for the better. Amor also makes peace with her. Overwhelmed, Claudia kneels at the altar and begs for forgiveness from all. The ghost of her daughter Clarissa appears to her smiling, signifying not only the peace her soul has found, but also the closure to all the narrative arcs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Five years after the wedding, Yna and Angelo are expecting a child. Claudia has found peace inside prison, where she also eventually marries Simon. With all contradictions resolved, Amor and Eduardo fulfill the promise of their undying love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The soap is also considered an important landmark in Philippine broadcasting for initiating the country&rsquo;s participation in the global soap opera market. It was shown, in dubbed or subtitled formats, in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and Africa, earning consistent following among locals. On China&rsquo;s national television in 2010, it reportedly &ldquo;rated second over all local and foreign programs airing in that country&hellip; and even hit the Top 30 list in the national weekly ranking, covering over 2,000 channels and capturing 1.3 billion viewers&rdquo; (<b><i>Asian Journal San Diego</i></b>). It was the first Filipino soap that became a major hit on Ugandan television in 2012. The Cambodian Television Network bought the soap concept for local adaptation in 2013. This took place even as the network was already preparing for a remake of the soap opera. The local remake started airing on 25 May 2015 and ended on 12 Feb 2016, presenting a more compact and highly improved plot. Popular teen idols Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla reprised the roles of Yna and Angelo, respectively. Sta. Maria, who was part of the original cast as Claudia&rsquo;s daughter, played the role of Amor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Pangako Sa &rsquo;Yo</i></b> received several accolades, including a best drama series runner up and a direction citation from the Asian Television Awards in 2001, the PMPC Star Awards for Best TV Series in 2001, and the PMPC Star Awards for Best Actress for Eula Valdez in 2001 and Jean Garcia in 2002. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written byLouie Jon A.

Aling Chayong dies from the accident, but, unknown to Amor, her daughter survives the tragedy and is found by the couple Belen and Isko Macaspac. Amor witnesses the tragedy on TV and pleads with Mr. Powers to send her back home, but she is refused and further battered. One day, Mr. Powers suffers a stroke, never to recover. The vengeful Amor allows her husband to wither away in pain, while she waits to collect her fortune. After he dies, she returns to the country, embodying a new personality expressed in her name: &#x201C;Amor Powers.&#x201D; Filled with rage, she returns to exact vengeance on everyone who caused all of her suffering."

By a stroke of luck and due to the appearance to her in dreams of a repentant Do&#xF1;a Benita, she finds herself working at the Buenavista hacienda&#x2014;like her mother before her.

It was the first Filipino soap that became a major hit on Ugandan television in 2012. The Cambodian Television Network bought the soap concept for local adaptation in 2013. This took place even as the network was already preparing for a remake of the soap opera. The local remake started airing on 25 May 2015 and ended on 12 Feb 2016, presenting a more compact and highly improved plot.

It pioneered investigative broadcast journalism when public affairs on Philippine television consisted mostly of talk. It ran for a total of 24 years. It was renamed <b><i>The Probe Team</i></b> when it moved to GMA as a one-hour monthly special in 1988 but became a weekly one-hour documentary magazine program after the show&rsquo;s third telecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2003, facing a threat of censorship, the show had a dispute with GMA regarding its feature on the lifestyle of the chair of the Philippine Amusements and Gaming Corporation(PAGCOR), Ephraim Genuino, a close ally of then President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. The program then transferred to ABC 5 and was renamed <b><i>The Probe Team Documentaries</i></b>. It returned to ABS-CBN as <b><i>Probe</i></b> in 2005 and focused on profiles of people and was thus renamed <b><i>Probe Profiles</i></b>, which featured personalities such as controversial celebrity doctor Hayden Kho, billiards world champion Efren &ldquo;Bata&rdquo; Reyes, and &ldquo;King of Comedy&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>. Its last episode aired in 2010 featuring the candidacy of President Benigno Aquino III.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Probe</i></b> raised the standard in news and public affairs programs by combining intensive, well-researched, and courageous reports that focused on giving substantive and hard-hitting analyses of social issues, fearlessly exposing the hard truths about Philippine society, combined with excellent production values. It presented a deeper understanding and appreciation of various socially important subjects.

The program&rsquo;s first guest, Bernabe Buscayno, aka Kumander Dante, the founder and leader of the Communist armed group New People&rsquo;s Army who was then newly released from prison by the Corazon Aquino dispensation, was replying in Filipino to questions posed in English by David. During one of the breaks, Buscayno requested David to switch to Filipino, a suggestion which the host and the director accommodated. The rest of the interview flowed smoothly and without restraint, demonstrating the benefit of using Filipino. The show became popular to audiences who saw the Filipino language as an empowering tool for the expression of critical opinion about society. Most public affairs programs of the period eventually shifted to Filipino. Earlier attempts on the use of Filipino in television programs did not fare well, as in the case of BBC-2&rsquo;s <b><i>Coffee with Lee</i></b>, 1978, a daily early morning talk program hosted by Lee Andres and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4974\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4975\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4976\"><strong>Noel Trinidad</strong></a></strong></a></strong></a>.

Buscayno survived the ambush, but Sibal and Sanchez died. The show started to lose sponsors when its discussions began attacking big cigarette and liquor companies. It was pushed to late-night programming when networks started to give priority to entertainment shows to time slots initially given to talk programs.

The program began in 1979 when Custodio capped the newscast with a <i>puplongano</i>n (saying, quotation, or proverb) that was relevant to the news of the day, in the Samar-Leyte language, Waray. A year later, listeners were invited to send their own <i>puplonganon</i>, which were read on the air. Contributions from the audience poured in, including poems, that the station gave it its own time slot. Initially titled <b><i>Puplonganon</i></b>, it was soon also called <b><i>Siday </i>(</b>poem or poetry) due to the popularity of the Waray poetry penned by listeners, mostly ordinary folk from Samar and Leyte. With more contributions than airtime, the program became a competition and the entry selected for the day was the winner. Daily winners competed for the annual prize that grew with the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Poet Merlie Alunan attributes audience enthusiasm for the program not to the prize money but to its ability to serve as a means of literary publication in the region. The DYVL siday<i>, </i>written about current issues, serves as a creative outlet and an alternative to local print weeklies and dailies not too open to literary contributions such that it became the Waray siday. On the other hand, scholar Jose Duke Bagulaya laments that most Waray are today unaware of the variety of Waray poetry and associate the word <i>siday </i>with the only poetry they hear, the daily <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1495\"><strong>Radyo Puplonganon/Siday</strong></a></i></b>. Required by competition rules to teach moral lessons, the DYVL siday sounds preachy to some, but poet Victor Sugbo attests that the Waray audience loves them.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The program was awarded the Gawad <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3063\"><strong>Iluminado Lucente</strong></a> in July 1998 by the Komite ng Centro ng Wikang Filipino, University of the Philippines Tacloban College. Credited for the proliferation of the siday, DYVL is frequently invited in siday contests such as the first poetry contest in Waray, the Pasidungog Eduardo A. Makabenta Sr Parahan Siday, 2010, in honor of well-known Waray writer Eduardo A. Makabenta Sr. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Allison Anne G.

With more contributions than airtime, the program became a competition and the entry selected for the day was the winner. Daily winners competed for the annual prize that grew with the program."

The DYVL siday<i>, </i>written about current issues, serves as a creative outlet and an alternative to local print weeklies and dailies not too open to literary contributions such that it became the Waray siday. On the other hand, scholar Jose Duke Bagulaya laments that most Waray are today unaware of the variety of Waray poetry and associate the word <i>siday </i>with the only poetry they hear, the daily <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1495\"><strong>Radyo Puplonganon/Siday</strong></a></i></b>. Required by competition rules to teach moral lessons, the DYVL siday sounds preachy to some, but poet Victor Sugbo attests that the Waray audience loves them.<br>\n"

The stories are presented without a host or narrator, highlighting the viewpoint of ordinary people whose daily lives are made inhuman because they lack access to basic necessities, such as food, shelter, education, and health services. Following the <b>cinema</b> <b>verite</b> style of filmmaking, the documentaries narrate the common person&rsquo;s struggles to have a life that is just and humane in the midst of seemingly insurmountable odds. Related topics explored by the program include environmental issues, such as wildlife trafficking; the social aspects of health, such as sexually transmitted diseases; the changing dynamics of the Filipino family, such as long-distance relationships; commitment to work that demands more than the self&rsquo;s personal aspirations, such as dedicated teachers, doctors, and social workers in far-flung areas who attend to needs of neglected sectors beyond what is required of their professions; and other individual narratives of responding to the challenges of a poor country like the Philippines.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Reel Time</i></b>&rsquo;s programming schedule is an attempt by the network to put a documentary on primetime on a weekend to challenge other networks&rsquo;

text-align:justify\">Many of the program&rsquo;s notable episodes are about children. &ldquo;Salat&rdquo; (Famished) documents the lives of malnourished children in slum areas. &ldquo;Lusong&rdquo; (Take a Dip) is about children who, in order to provide for the needs of their family, scour the dirty shores of an urban coastal community for marine resources and recyclable garbage. &ldquo;Alitaptap sa Dagat&rdquo; (Firefly of the Sea) presents two children who go out to fish at night using improvised underwater lamps. &ldquo;Batang Halau&rdquo; (Banished Children) tackles the stateless identities and the precarious situation of undocumented Sabah-born Filipino children who are considered illegal aliens in Malaysia; their parents were Mindanao residents who were forced to move to Malaysia because of political turmoil and poverty in Mindanao and are undocumented settlers in Sabah. &ldquo;Buho&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a>) follows the lives of three children who cut bamboo poles of 14-50 feet in height from the forest and carry them to their lowland settlements, which their parents chop up as barbecue sticks. &ldquo;Tira&rdquo; (Go Ahead) explores the lives of alcohol-addicted adolescents engaging in unprotected sex who are afflicted with sexually transmitted diseases. &ldquo;Dungkoy&rdquo; is about nine-year-old Dungkoy, who, in spite of being abandoned by his parents, religiously takes care of his paralyzed grandmother. &ldquo;Silang mga Wala sa Mapa&rdquo; (They Who Are Off the Grid) documents the lives of children belonging to the Blaan ethnic group living in the mountains of Saranggani in Mindanao and how a volunteer doctor, with help from volunteer nurses and social workers, attend to all their medical needs. &ldquo;Gulong&rdquo; (Wheel) is about a 15-year-old person with disability who begs for alms on a national highway to sustain the basic food needs of his family. &ldquo;Isinulat sa Tubig&rdquo; (Written on Water) chronicles the travails of children who have to cross neck-deep rivers to go to school while they await the fulfillment of politicians&rsquo; promise of a bridge that will connect their settlements to the community center where the school is located. &ldquo;Isang Paa sa Hukay&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Foot in the Grave aka The Price of Gold) is about impoverished children who risk their lives diving down narrow mine shafts with only an air compressor to support their breathing for very little pieces of gold. &ldquo;Nibulaysir&rdquo; (Nebulizer) presents a 25-year-old mother, derided as ignorant by her seven-year-old daughter, who decides to return to school as a Grade 1 student, with her daughter as a classmate.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Reel Time</i></b>&rsquo;s documentaries have won several awards. &ldquo;Salat&rdquo;

In the mid-2000s, a short-lived version of the show focusing on international Filipino music artists called <b><i>World Musikahan</i></b><i> </i>(World Music Festival),<i> </i>featuring the likes of Christine Adiaz and Daphne Mombay and broadcast abroad on The Filipino Channel (TFC),<i> </i>came into existence. Since 2012, complete re-runs of the original <b><i>Ryan Ryan Musikahan</i></b> have continued to air on the ABS-CBN-owned cable channel Jeepney TV.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In each episode, Ryan Cayabyab invited a musician, or a group of musicians, to perform with him on stage. He usually accompanied each performer as a pianist except in cases when doing so would become disruptive, for example if the guest was a solo instrumentalist of a different musical instrument. In between songs, Cayabyab would interview his guests. Each of these conversational interludes would cover a range of topics, from the guests&rsquo; current projects to their own personal stories of how they ended up pursuing a life of music.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cayabyab, affectionately known as Mr. C and The Maestro in the local music industry, was instrumental in the success and enduring presence in the history of the program. Being a multi-awarded conductor, composer, arranger, pianist, and singer himself and having served as mentor to multiple successful popular stars and singing groups, Cayabyab understandably enjoyed extensive contacts at all levels of the music and recording industry. Many artists who would normally never appear on a televised music show agreed to become guests simply because it was Cayabyab who invited them to come.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sheer variety of musical guests that could appear on every episode is one of the biggest reasons why the show became so successful. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> week, Cayabyab may play host to a currently popular singer with a smash hit on the Top 40, and the next, he would have a trio of classical musicians, more at home playing concertos in old theaters than getting interviewed on national television, playing cello and trombone in front of the camera. Viewers would often discover new artists to patronize, and performers find new segments to address, simply from guesting on the show. The show became an iconic part of the television landscape for Filipino viewers during the years it was on air, and it was an honor for local performers to perform in the show.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Due to its long tenure on ABS-CBN, <b><i>Ryan Ryan Musikahan</i></b><i> </i>has a wealth of noteworthy episodes in its history. Its first guest on its pilot episode was a young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\"><strong>Gary Valenciano</strong></a>, the same year that Valenciano won his first music award, the best theme song award from the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences for the song <b><i>Ibulong Mo Sa Diyos</i></b><i> (</i>Whisper It to God).<i> </i>The first and only Filipino international champion of the iconic US talent show <b><i>Star Search</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/572\"><strong>Josephine</strong></a> Banig Roberto, flew to Manila just to be a guest on the program. Smokey Mountain, a children&rsquo;s singing group mentored by Cayabyab himself that produced classic hits such as <b><i>Paraiso</i></b><i> (</i>Paradise) and <b><i>Kailan</i></b><i> (</i>When), appeared on a 1990 episode of the program. When the group&rsquo;s first and second batches of young singers later disbanded, its most popular alumni, such as Geneva Cruz, Jeffrey Hidalgo, Anna Fegi, and Shar Santos, would later return to the show to do solo acts.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It would not be an exaggeration to say that almost every significant Filipino music artist of the 1980s and the early 1990s, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4220\"><strong>Regine Velasquez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3366\"><strong>Monique Wilson</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4041\"><strong>Celeste Legaspi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4040\"><strong>Kuh Ledesma</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3235\"><strong>Lea Salonga</strong></a></strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, once shared the stage with Cayabyab on <b><i>Ryan Ryan Musikahan</i></b><i>.</i><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">More recently, <b><i>Ryan Ryan Musikahan</i></b>&rsquo;s<i> </i>nostalgia-inducing re-runs on Jeepney TV have proven to be surprisingly popular to an entirely new set of viewers. Its success has prompted the network to fund two concerts based on the old show that were then later broadcast as TV specials. The first concert, held at the Rockwell Tent in Makati City, was a Christmas special entitled <b><i>Ryan Ryan Musikahan: At Home For Christmas </i></b>(Music of Ryan: At Home For Christmas), with musical direction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4159\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Gerard Salonga</strong></a></strong></a>. It aired on Jeepney TV on 14 Dec 2014. Industry veterans such as Gary Valenciano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3887\"><strong>Bamboo</strong></a> Ma&ntilde;alac, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4959\"><strong>Aiza Seguerra</strong></a>, Menchu Lauchengco-Yulo, and Cayabyab himself performed a plethora of classic Christmas songs and carols. The Orchestra of Filipino Youth and the Advertiser&rsquo;s Chorale also participated in the event with their own musical numbers. Jeepney TV aired a second TV special, titled <b><i>Ryan Ryan Musikahan</i></b><i>:<b> Piyano at Gitara</b> </i>(Music of Ryan: Piano and Guitar), on 9 Aug 2015. Directed by Johnny Manahan, this show featured performances from some of the country&rsquo;s most popular contemporary acoustic artists. Cayabyab performed with singer-songwriter Nyoy Volante, singer Kyla, guitarist Bullet Dumas, independent musician Johnoy Danao, and television matinee idol Xian Lim. These two television specials proved to be a big success for Cayabyab and the network. While a revival of the original version of the show seems unlikely, its continued popularity almost guarantees the production of more one-time themed specials in the years to come.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Ryan Ryan</i></b><i> <b>Musikahan</b> </i>won the Gawad CCP Para sa Telebisyon in 1988 and 1992; best music program in the Catholic Mass Media Awards in 1988, 1989, and 1990; and best musical show in 1989 and 1992, and best musical show host for Cayabyab, also in 1989 and 1992 in the Star Awards of the Philippine Movie Press Club.<em><strong> Written by Laurence Roxas with notes from Eulalio R.

The title is a pun that combined the program&rsquo;s live shooting schedule time with the name of the APO Hiking Society. The program was directed by Danni Caparas and was shot live from the Delta Theater in Quezon City. The show served as direct competition against rival network GMA&rsquo;s similar Sunday music-variety program, <b><i>The</i> <i>GMA Supershow</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Each episode<i> </i>primarily involved musical performances from the permanent cast as well as special numbers from other guest artists. In contrast to modern versions of the Sunday musical-variety program that stick solely to song and dance performances, <b><i>Sa Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b><i> </i>also featured the occasional non-musical segments such as the sponsored raffles &ldquo;Cleene Premyo sa Rolyo&rdquo; (Cleene Prize in the Roll) and the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2292\"><strong>Sarimanok</strong></a> Sweepstakes.&rdquo;<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The eponymous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\"><strong>Apolinario Mabini</strong></a> (APO) Hiking Society&rsquo;s position as the creative leads of the program helped shape the type of entertainment the show featured, and would eventually become known and loved for. The multi-awarded and highly prolific singing trio is widely considered to be preeminent figures in the movement to promote Original Pilipino Music (OPM) in the country. They influenced <b><i>Sa Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b><i> </i>to shine the spotlight on local artists that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. Many acts that would have otherwise been doomed to languish in the land of &ldquo;almost-made-it&rdquo; instead reaped unheralded success thanks to repeated exposure to the masses through guest appearances on <b><i>Sa Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b><i>.</i><br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The OPM alternative music boom of the early to mid-1990s owes a great deal to the opportunities given to them by APO and <b><i>Sa Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b>. While OPM has always produced and continues to produce great local bands making high-quality music, the lack of mainstream exposure has always held these groups back from becoming truly successful. <b><i>Sa Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b><i> </i>changed all that. From experienced industry vets like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\"><strong>The Dawn</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4233\"><strong>Wolfgang</strong></a>, Razorback, Orient Pearl, and Alamid to then-new bands like Color It Red, After Image, True Faith, along with future rock legends <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4147\"><strong>Rivermaya</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3974\"><strong>Eraserheads</strong></a>, all had their television introduction to the Filipino <i>masa</i> as performers on the program. The goodwill APO had generated back in that era is so pervasive that even a full decade after the show&rsquo;s last episode, a plethora of OPM bands, both new and old, clamored to be part of two tribute albums <b><i>Kami nAPO Muna</i></b><i>:<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>te to APO Hiking Society </b></i>(It&rsquo;s Our Turn: Tribute to APO Hiking Society)<b> </b>and its follow up record <b><i>Kami nAPO Muna Ulit: Tribute to APO Hiking Society</i></b> (It&rsquo;s Our Turn Again: Tribute to APO Hiking Society) dedicated to celebrating APO&rsquo;s staggering accomplishments and contributions to the local music scene.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The show aired its last episode on 29 Jan 1995 and was replaced by <b><i>ASAP</i></b>, another musical-variety show in a similar format but with a new set of younger hosts like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4584\"><strong>Zsa Zsa Padilla</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3984\"><strong>Pops Fernandez</strong></a>.<br />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the country&rsquo;s longest running variety show <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>jumped ship from ABS-CBN to rival GMA, <b><i>Sa Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b><i> </i>was rebranded into a new noontime show called <b><i>&rsquo;Sang Linggo nAPO Sila</i></b><i> (</i>They&rsquo;re Here All Week) to fill ABS-CBN&rsquo;s weekday noon schedule. This new show ran six days a week, 90 minutes from Mondays to Fridays and 150 minutes on Saturdays. It retained APO Hiking Society as the main hosts along with original co-hosts Isidro, de Leon, Loyzaga, and Perez, in 1995-98.

It went on air for a total of 18 years, punctuated by years of absence from 1965-74 and 1987-88. It had its roots on radio CBN-DZXL, titled <b><i>CBN Canteen</i></b>, a 15-minute lunchtime musical program that began in July 1957. It featured Priscilla Aristorenas, the &ldquo;Kolynos Girl of the Philippines.&rdquo; Kolynos was a popular brand of toothpaste at that time. She sang live, with a piano, bass, and drums. Students, mainly from Letran, Lyceum, and nearby schools, came to the CBN studio on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\"><strong>Aduana</strong></a> Street in Intramuros to watch her sing. The show became so popular that it was extended to 30 minutes. The program was reformatted as a daily talk-music show when Leila Benitez replaced Aristorenas, who moved to London with her husband, saxophonist Bernardo Aristorenas. Hordes of college students regularly trooped to CBN to watch Benitez at work in the studio booth. Because of its popularity, it was reformatted in 1958 to enable greater participation from the program&rsquo;s youth followers and was given the title <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>, with additional hosts Ilarde and Pimentel, and singer Nelda Navarro. Its new segment, a regular amateur singing contest, attracted its young audiences to participate in the contest, which did not require a good singing voice but simply the guts and the heart to carry a performance through. Such format led to a lot of funny situations. The show&rsquo;s brand of humor was never loud. The hilarity depended on the spontaneous, rapid-fire banter and friendly one-upmanship of the three hosts. In 1958, a time when television was the new medium of broadcasting, management moved the show to CBN TV Channel 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ledesma joined the hosting group in 1960. He first worked as the show&rsquo;s floor director and occasionally did the voiceover of the program&rsquo;s opening lines &ldquo;Hello there. It&rsquo;s 12 high noon and welcome to <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>!&rdquo; He also would sometimes render a song or deliver a few spiels until he became a regular host of the show. In 1964, a serious misunderstanding with management led Benitez, Ilarde, and Ledesma to give up on the show. The three hosts announced on the show that they were ending the program, and they walked out of the show. When the walkout occurred, CBN executives had new hosts Aniceto and Anson ready to join Pimentel who decided to stay on the program. Ledesma and Benitez moved over to Channel 11 where they, together with Eddie Mercado, hosted <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b>. Ilarde went on with his radio program <b><i>The Eddie Ilarde Show</i></b>. The new batch of hosts, however, failed to maintain the popularity of the show. Its young audiences drifted to other shows. The show folded up in 1964, six months after the original hosts left the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> was revived on 6 Jan 1975 on GMA, whose general manager then was Rod Reyes. The revival of the show was ably supported by GMA stockholders Gilberto Duavit and Menardo Jimenez. The show was co-produced by the network with new blocktimer Program Philippines Inc. Ilarde, Ledesma, and Pimentel returned as hosts of the program, with Pimentel leaving the show after six months. Pimentel was replaced by Ricky Manalo Jr, who, finding it difficult to fit in the group, left the show after a month. A new young female host was introduced in the program, Coney Reyes, who would later become one of local television&rsquo;s best hosts and most-awarded actors.

It went on air for a total of 18 years, punctuated by years of absence from 1965-74 and 1987-88. It had its roots on radio CBN-DZXL, titled <b><i>CBN Canteen</i></b>, a 15-minute lunchtime musical program that began in July 1957. It featured Priscilla Aristorenas, the &#x201C;Kolynos Girl of the Philippines.&#x201D; Kolynos was a popular brand of toothpaste at that time. She sang live, with a piano, bass, and drums. Students, mainly from Letran, Lyceum, and nearby schools, came to the CBN studio on <a href=\"/2/8/260\"><strong>Aduana</strong></a> Street in Intramuros to watch her sing. The show became so popular that it was extended to 30 minutes. The program was reformatted as a daily talk-music show when Leila Benitez replaced Aristorenas, who moved to London with her husband, saxophonist Bernardo Aristorenas. Hordes of college students regularly trooped to CBN to watch Benitez at work in the studio booth. Because of its popularity, it was reformatted in 1958 to enable greater participation from the program&#x2019;s youth followers and was given the title <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b>, with additional hosts Ilarde and Pimentel, and singer Nelda Navarro. Its new segment, a regular amateur singing contest, attracted its young audiences to participate in the contest, which did not require a good singing voice but simply the guts and the heart to carry a performance through. Such format led to a lot of funny situations. The show&#x2019;s brand of humor was never loud. The hilarity depended on the spontaneous, rapid-fire banter and friendly one-upmanship of the three hosts. In 1958, a time when television was the new medium of broadcasting, management moved the show to CBN TV Channel 9."

The three hosts announced on the show that they were ending the program, and they walked out of the show. When the walkout occurred, CBN executives had new hosts Aniceto and Anson ready to join Pimentel who decided to stay on the program. Ledesma and Benitez moved over to Channel 11 where they, together with Eddie Mercado, hosted <b><i>Darigold Jamboree</i></b>. Ilarde went on with his radio program <b><i>The Eddie Ilarde Show</i></b>. The new batch of hosts, however, failed to maintain the popularity of the show. Its young audiences drifted to other shows.

Each episode starts with a short drama, which is then followed by a discussion on the topic or theme tackled in the dramatic segment.

It was based on a daily cartoon comic strip by Nonoy Marcelo in <b><i>The Manila Times </i></b>in 1963. The cartoon strip, on the other hand, was based on the comic strip <b><i>Pytik</i></b>, which Marcelo, while a student, created for <b><i>The Advocate</i></b>, the student paper of the Far Eastern University (FEU). The show mirrored the beatnik culture of the turbulent decade, exposed the dilemma of the restless youth, and highlighted the contradictions between the young and the old. The characters Tisoy (Morato), Maribubut (Pilapil, then Miss Philippines 1967), Professor Naspu (Sicam), Clip (Dumapias), Ka Tiquio (Bert Tawa), Caligula (Celis), Aling Otik (Diaz), Pomposa (Belandres), and Tisay (Jacinto), spoke the slang language of the streets of the city. The main character Tisoy, a beardless youth modeled after Marcelo&rsquo;s mentor and then FEU Dean of Arts and Sciences Alejandro &ldquo;Anding&rdquo; Roces, personified the rejection of traditional roles imposed on the youth by society. Then young writers Bibsy Carballo and Joan Orendain were the models for Maribubut and Aling Otik, respectively, while poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5213\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5214\"><strong>Florentino Dauz</strong></a></strong></a> served as the model for the frail Caligula.

Because of the success of their first presentation at the Abelardo Hall, the amateur play <b><i>Tisoy</i></b> was staged two more times in a span of four months, and was also staged in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2162\"><strong>Cavite</strong></a>.

Others in the cast were Ike Lozada, Aruray, and Jerry Pons. Another film version was produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>&rsquo;s NV Productions in 1977, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\"><strong>Ishmael Bernal</strong></a> and written by Marcelo himself.

The show began airing in the late 1970s, a time when the number of Filipinos taking up contract work abroad began to rise dramatically. The program became the model for shows targeted at OFWs and their families, giving rise to what is now called migrant journalism. During the period, a significant number of Filipino contract workers provided labor in the Middle East oil fields and construction projects, many in Saudi Arabia. It was a time before mobile phones and expensive long distance telephone calls were the only means to connect their families with them instantly, which the program provided. The show included a segment dramatizing the plight of the OFWs and the families they left in the Philippines.

It pioneered on women&rsquo;s use of media to influence social change. Its call phrase is &ldquo;<i>panahon na</i>&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s about time). The concept of the program was inspired by <b><i>From Priestess to Prostitute</i></b>, a slideshow on the story of Philippine women through the centuries produced in Mar 1985 by the Progressive Women&rsquo;s Spiritual Association (PWSA) and the radio program <b><i>All Things Considered</i></b>, heard by journalist Anna Leah Sarabia during a visit to the USA in Jul 1985 over the network National Public Radio, which featured the ongoing United Nations World Conference on Women in Nairobi, Kenya.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\"></div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In order to work on the pioneering program, its producers, the Women&rsquo;s Media Circle (WMC) incorporated in 1986 and became a foundation in 1987. WMC started out as a volunteer partnership of three activist women&rsquo;s groups: PWSA, Pilipina, and the Women&rsquo;s Desk of the Concerned Artists of the Philippines (WD-CAP). Three women served as representatives of each group in the conceptualization of the program: Anna Leah Sarabia for PWSA, Remmy Rikken for Pilipina, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5436\"><strong>Marra PL. Lanot</strong></a> for WD-CAP. TV Director Maria V. Montelibano trained the WMC pioneers to put together a TV production in the early months of 1986, while activist-turned-TV executive Doris Nuval Baffrey and veteran media manager Patricia L. Monzon facilitated the move of the radio program to a television show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The TV program was first broadcast from the government-owned network during the Marcos era. Therefore, criticism of government policies had to be done from the perspective of women&rsquo;s issues and not to campaign for toppling the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the EDSA Revolution, the radio program moved to Radyo ng Bayan, and began broadcasting live in Mar 1986. Political events forced the producers to move to DWWW in 1988, where it evolved into a thrice weekly program, and then to DWIZ in 1990, where it had a daily hour-long schedule, until finally signing off at the end of Aug 1993.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Radyo Womanwatch</i></b> (Womanwatch Radio) over DWWW became a teaching program, where WMC shared its airtime venue with Kaiba Women&rsquo;s Party, Samahan ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a>ng Kababaihan/Gabriela, Women&rsquo;s Health Coalition, Katipunan ng Bagong Pilipina, and the Women&rsquo;s Studies Association. They took turns every two weeks producing a radio program and promoting women&rsquo;s issues. Some of these groups eventually found the funds and developed the capacity to produce their own radio shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But it was the television program <b><i>Womanwatch </i></b>that caught public attention when it first aired in Sep 1986 over PTV-4. The host, Nikki Coseteng, was then a well-known &ldquo;street parliamentarian&rdquo; and a leader of the left-oriented group WOMB or Women for the Ouster of Marcos and Boycott, as well as the owner of an art gallery with a high-profile basketball team that sported her name, Gallerie Dominique.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Womanwatch</i></b> started out as a variety and magazine show, focusing on a wide range of topics, giving proof to the feminist statement that &ldquo;all issues are women&rsquo;s issues.&rdquo; Guests were interviewed live in the studio, while pre-taped segments were shot on location in Ilocos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a>, Hong Kong, Paris, and Dharamsala featured a wide variety of stories. These ranged from the travails of overseas Filipino workers, migrant brides from New Zealand to Dubai, the veterans of the Japanese era women guerrillas, child prostitutes, LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) activism, indigenous women artists, women farmers, women in religious orders, and women rising in the corporate world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Womanwatch</i></b> became the launching pad of several heretofore &ldquo;private&rdquo; issues into the public sphere, like incest, sexual harassment, abortion, domestic violence,and child abuse. Through phone line audience participation, actualincidents and problems were reported on the air by victims andfamily members.These discussions sometimes led to the formation of national campaigns, andeven to theconvening of conferences on such issues.The Tigil Bugbog Hotline<i> </i>and the Kababaihan Laban sa Karahasan or KALAKASAN Hotline were established in May 1991, first, because of reports made to PTV-4 and to the office of Coseteng inCongress about wife beating and violence, and, second, because of the seeming non-existence of either government or non-government initiatives to address such problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Womanwatch </i></b>was &ldquo;unintentionally&rdquo; put off the air while a live discussion on women activists showed footage of the resurrection of the underground left-wing MAKIBAKA (Malayang Samahan ng Bagong Kababaihan) in 1987.
