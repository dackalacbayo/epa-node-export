		"media_caption": "Communist Hukbalahap movement because of government failure to implement agrarian reforms and the nonpayment of their war benefits. In Lupang Pangako (Promised Land), 1949, and Mga Busabos ng Palad (Slaves of Destiny), 1948, guerrillas find themselves jobless and are forced to either beg or steal. In Palaboy ng Tadhana (The Tramp of Fate), 1947, a guerrilla pawns his medal so he could buy lunch for himself and a street urchin.     The Studio System  In the 1950s three studios emerged as the country’s top filmmakers and starbuilders: LVN, Sampaguita, and Premiere. A study of the number of films produced from 1946 to 1960 would show the dominance of the Big Three Studios (see Table 1). From 45 percent of the total output in 1946, the combined production of LVN, Premiere, and Sampaguita steadily increased to 71 percent of the output of the industry by 1949. Even during the years when labor problems slowed down the production of Premiere, from 1952 to 1954, the output of the three studios averaged a little over 60 percent of the industry total. From 1955 to 1960, the trio accounted for not less than one-third of the industry output. The highest percentage of dominance happened in 1956, with 78 percent (or 65 movies) produced by the Big Three against 22 percent (or 18 movies) by the rest of the industry. From 1946 to 1960, the industry produced a total of 1,151 movies. Of this output, the Big Three Studios accounted for 751 movies (or 65 percent) against the 400 movies produced by other companies (or 35 percent).   1 / 10  Cesar Ramirez and Aura Aurea in Gerardo de Leon’s Huwag Mo Akong Limutin, 1960  (Cesar Hernando Collection)    The Big Three Studios had their own stable of stars, directors, scriptwriters, and technicians, all on exclusive contracts. Studio bosses looked over the day’s rushes and passed judgment on style and content. Publicists wrote articles on the stars, thought up gimmicks to promote movies, and planned premieres and birthday bashes.     The Popular Genres  In time, each studio developed its own forte and came to be identified with a particular genre. Sampaguita was very successful with so-called women’s pictures. LVN had a gold mine in screwball comedies and swordplay. Premiere banked on action films.     Action films of this period were set in the past and in faraway lands. Adapted from folktales or recreated according to the 19th-century awit and korido (metrical romance) tradition, these films were set in medieval Europe or in South Sea islands. The hero is a romantic figure, handsome, self-effacing, quick-witted, exhibits great skill in sports and the martial arts, and is utterly compassionate toward the oppressed. Although he begins life as nobility, circumstances conspire to rob him of his birthright. He is raised among goats and cattle and endures humiliation. He learns early in life about the hardships of the masses. He is the underdog, and the moviegoers identify with him. But these qualities are not enough to overcome a tyrant or a marauding army of invaders. A kind spirit from heaven appears to reward his steadfastness with an amulet or a magic potion that enables him to vanquish his foes.     In Prinsipe Teñoso (Prince Teñoso), 1954, the handsome prince disobeys his father and offers food to a hungry beggar; he is exiled from the palace. The old man turns out to be a sorcerer who gives him the power to change his form and appearance. As a beggar, he wanders from country to country. One day, a beautiful princess espies him while he is taking a bath in his princely form. When told to pick a husband, she chooses the beggar to the consternation of her father, the king. She is exiled and lives with him in a shack. Still in disguise, he learns that infidels are about to storm her father’s palace. As a prince again, he rescues his beloved’s father, drives the invaders away, and is reunited with his family. He becomes the ruler of the two kingdoms.     In Bernardo Carpio , 1951, an old man offers the hero advice on how to subjugate a band of South Sea warriors who kidnapped his beloved. In Nuno sa Punso (Old Man of the Anthill), 1950, a distraught lover is reduced in size so that he can rescue his betrothed in the secret chambers of the mounds. In Haring Kobra (King Cobra), 1951, a twin brother acquires a magic ring that can summon snakes to his defense. In Thor, 1962, a magic cane helps the hero save his fair lady from her ravishers.     This tradition in action films was carried on through the decades starring big action stars, like Leopoldo Salcedo and Jose Padilla Jr in the 1950s; Joseph Estrada, Tony Ferrer, and Jun Aristorenas in the 1960s; Ramon Revilla and Jess Lapid in the 1970s; and Fernando Poe Jr for over four decades since the late 1950s.     Musical s dramatize the wide gap between the rich and the poor, between landlords and tenants, between city mores and folk customs. Lovers vow undying love to each other in the beginning but are temporarily separated by parental disapproval or the temptations of the city. In Maalaala Mo Kaya ? (Will You Remember?), 1954, two lovers of humble origins sing their vows of eternal devotion and fidelity. Later their engagement is broken up by a wily city entrepreneur. They are reunited several years later by the same song they sang under the mango tree. In Paruparong Bukid (Country Butterfly), 1959, the mother forbids her daughter to be courted by a farmer and forces her to marry a crooked army official.     The musicals are less preoccupied with feudal realities, but they are not much different from past productions. The stories still retell the trip from rags to riches. The rich and the poor still disagree and clash, and lovers have to overcome familial and societal prejudices before they can be united in holy matrimony. Such are the themes of movies like Sa Libis ng Nayon (On the Outskirts of the Barrio) and Batangueña in the 1950s; Stop, Look, Listen and Susanang Daldal (Susan the Chatterbox) in the 1960s; Gift of Love and Living Doll in the 1970s.     Fantasy films use a host of special effects, but like other genres they dramatize the frustrations and heartbreaks of living in an oppressive environment. The early fantasy films are about people born different, people with physical defects who are considered outcasts by an insensitive populace. Only the intervention of deities can save the beleaguered from the evils of societal prejudice and even from imminent death.     In Cofradia, 1953, a black girl is discriminated against because of society’s preference for Caucasian features. Her kindness to a stranger brings the gift of a candle that allows her to turn white when it is lighted. In Tucydides, 1954, a man and a woman in a barren marriage pray for a child. Their prayers are answered, but the child that is born to them is incredibly tiny, small enough to fit inside a pocket. They are ashamed of their offspring and often maltreat the poor girl. She finally runs away to Manila, becomes a normal woman, and saves a distraught lover from the schemes of his unfaithful sweetheart.     In Dyesebel , 1953, a girl with fins is born to a childless couple. She is considered a handiwork of evil, and their neighbors curse and stone her. One day, even her father attempts to kill her. She swims down to the ocean floor and meets other mermaids. For a time, she is happy with her own kind but one day she falls in love with a rich young man whose girlfriend plots his murder. She saves him and asks the wise old sea hag to transform her into a human being.     Since the 1950s, there have been countless remakes of fantasy films. Each generation has its own Dyesebel and its own Darna . Other important fantasy films are Tuko sa Madre Kakaw (Gecko at Madre Cacao), Nagkita si Kerubin at si Tulisang Pugo t (Cherubin Meets the Headless Bandit), Kapitan Kidlat (Captain Lightning), and Mambo Dyambo in the 1950s; Anak ng Bulkan (Child of the Volcano) and Capt. Barbell contra Capt. Bakal (Capt. Barbell vs Capt. Iron) in the 1960s; Ang Panday (The Blacksmith) and Ang Mahiwagang Daigdig ni Pedro Penduko (The Mysterious World of Pedro Penduko) in the 1970s.     Melodramas are about lives caught in the passions of the heart and undermined by poverty and prejudice. Tension-ridden and full of violent gestures, melodramas are cathartic experiences with the viewers closely identifying with the characters. In Apat na Taga (Four Slashes), 1954, a domineering mother destroys the lives of her children. She is punished for her cruelty when she is afflicted with tuberculosis and rejected by society. In Busabos (Slave), 1956, a rich lover is prevented from marrying his fiancée by his friends’ intrigues and his mother’s admonition. The girl gets pregnant and is thrown out by her outraged parents. Years later, the lover is made to realize the purity of his sweetheart’s intentions. In Pagdating ng Takip-silim (When Twilight Comes), 1956, college students play a prank on an unsuspecting colleague. They place bets on the ability of a pretty coed to win his heart. The ruse works and the trick is exposed. To forget her, the student enlists in the air force and becomes a pilot. The girl is apologetic and this time is really in love with him. However, as she is already engaged to be married, she cannot return his love. On her wedding day, the pilot obliges by dropping flowers from the air. His plane crashes. The bride rushes to the scene of the crash, hears her lover calling her, and she herself falls from the cliff. The two souls are united in heaven.     In Roberta, 1951, the classic melodrama that focuses on child abuse, a philandering husband beats up his wife and children. He leaves them for a bar girl with underworld connections. He returns home from time to time to wrest his wife’s meager earnings as a laundrywoman. The children are forced to work and eventually the wife dies. The underworld characters are dissatisfied with the bar girl and kill her. They accuse the widowed husband of murder but there is a witness to the crime: Roberta. She is kidnapped by the goons to keep her away from the trial. She is rescued and offers the testimony that saves her father from the electric chair.     Surprisingly enough, melodramas in the succeeding decades are remakes of movies of this period. The plots are sometimes more dramatic, more turbulent, bespeaking of present harsh economic conditions. The themes and plot structures are similar. Important melodramas include Talipandas (Wayward) and Sino ang Maysala? (Who Is Guilty?) in the 1950s; Sapagkat Kami’y Tao Lamang (For We Are Only Human) and Kapantay ay Langit (As High as Heaven) in the 1960s; Maruja and Wanted: Perfect Mother in the 1970s.     In contrast, comedy offers relief from the problems of the day. Comedians capitalize on social satire and jokes about physical deformities but in a lighthearted vein. In Kambal Tuko (Siamese Twins), 1952, Siamese twins, played by Pugo and Togo, fumble while trying to solve a robbery. In Jack and Jill, 1954, a gay character subscribes to a romanticized view of life but this is undermined by his lower-class status. Comedy continues to be an important moneymaker through the decades because of major comedians like Dolphy, whose major hits include Jack and Jill, Hootsy-Kootsy, 1955, and Silveria, 1958. Later, comedians like Chiquito, Panchito, and Ramon Zamora continued Dolphy’s brand of comedy.     Ang Kandidato (Candidate), 1949, takes potshots at the country’s favorite pastime: politics. Two guerrillas try to free themselves from poverty’s grip by providing consultancy services to two rich landlords. Through chicanery and expert double-dealing, the two con men work on the gullibility of their victims. They spend all their money in trying to win the mayoral election. However, it is the third candidate who wins and the two landlords are reduced to poverty.     Filmmaking Beyond the Standard  Despite the standardized output of the studio system, individual filmmakers, as in Hollywood, were able to rise above the standard and give their unique signatures to their films. These filmmakers include Manuel Conde, Gerardo de Leon, Manuel Silos,Lamberto Avellana, andGregorio Fernandez.     Lamberto Avellana, collaborating with Manuel de Leon, son of Doña Sisang, the matriarch of LVN Studios, made his major contribution to Philippine cinema at the height of the studio system in the 1950s. Among his significant films is Anak Dalita (The Ruins), 1956. Based on a screenplay by Rolf Bayer, the main character is a Korean War veteran who returns to his country only to be disgruntled with the condition of his life. The film was a major risk. It veered away from the usual LVN musical comedies and costume movies; furthermore, the cast was composed of character actors Tony Santos as the war veteran and Rosa Rosal as the prostitute. Quite predictably, it failed in the box office but it won the Golden Harvest Award in the 1956 Asian Film Festival. Avellana followed up this project with Badjao, 1957, a view of life in a seafaring community in the South, and Kundiman ng Lahi (Love Song of the Race), 1959, in which the peaceful life of a rural community is disturbed by the construction of a factory.     During this period, Gerardo de Leon also directed a number of worthy films for Premiere: 48 Oras (48 Hours), 1950, a thriller in which a man, wrongly accused of murder, escapes to find the murderer; Sisa, 1951, a take on Jose Rizal’s character in Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not) who is driven by misery into insanity; Sawa sa Lumang Simboryo (Python in the Old Dome), 1952, the legend of a bandit during the Spanish period, in which de Leon uses a ballad that functions like a Greek chorus; Ifugao, 1954, an adventure focusing on a Northern tribe, with a memorable opening sequence of decapitation that signals the transition from black and white to color; and Kamay ni Cain (Hand of Cain), 1957, an action film driven by sibling rivalry and fate, starring Fernando Poe Jr and Zaldy Zshornack, popular teen stars then.     Manuel Silos, whose career spanned two generations, made Biyaya ng Lupa (Blessings of the Land), 1959, for LVN. This masterpiece is a warm depiction of the story of a rural family whose hopes depend on the fruits of the earth. Once again, the film stars Tony Santos and Rosa Rosal.     Gregorio Fernandez also made his notable melodramas at LVN. Most noteworthy is Malvarosa, 1958, a family drama set in the slums of the city. Manuel Conde, on the other hand, directed a number of moro-moro movies or costume films for LVN—from his collaboration with Vicente Salumbides in Ibong Adarna (Adarna Bird), 1941, to the postwar movies, like Ang Principeng Hindi Tumatawa (The Prince Who Does Not Laugh), 1946, Apat na Alas (Four Aces), 1950, and the remake Ibong Adarna , 1955. Moreover, Conde himself produced and directed some of his memorable films during this period, particularly Genghis Khan, 1950, which introduced the country in the 1952 Venice Film Festival. Conde would also be remembered for his satirical films Juan Tamad Goes to Congress, 1959, and Juan Tamad Goes to Society, 1960, the latter produced under LVN, and later Si Juan Tamad at si Juan Masipag sa Pulitikang Walang Hanggan (Lazy Juan and Industrious Juan in the Never-Ending Politics), 1963.     It should be noted that Visayan filmmakers from the southern provinces also made their presence felt during this period. In the 1950s, a flowering of sorts happened in the southern movie industry. In 1969, Badlis sa Kinabuhi (Life Lines), starring Gloria Sevilla, was nominated for Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences awards and won the Best Actress trophy for the Visayan star. In the 1970s, the Visayan movie industry declined, showing that the region could not sustain moviemaking.       Decline of the Studio System  The studio system declined in the 1960s. The slack in production brought about by the breakup of the studio system resulting from labor problems accelerated the production of films by smaller companies. Of these companies already in existence in the latter years of the 1950s, People’s Pictures, Larry Santiago Productions, Cirio H. Santiago Film Organization, Dalisay Pictures, Vera-Perez Productions, and Everlasting Pictures supplied the main bulk of film entertainment. Two companies that later became the biggest producers of movies in the 1960s were Tagalog Ilang-Ilang Productions and Lea Productions.     Mainstream moviemaking in the 1960s, in lieu of planning under the studio system, took the cue mainly from movies from the United States. Action movies coming out of Europe and the United States were increasingly dependent on the sensationalism of violence. James Bond films spawned many “secret agents” similarly licensed to kill, allowed to raise mayhem at any pretext, and given to extremes of violence. Made-in-Italy westerns encouraged Filipino producers to make Made-in-RP cowboy movies in which the hero found himself confronting landowning warlords who terrorized entire towns through their goons and guns. From Hong Kong and Japan came movies about invincible masters of martial arts. Their local counterparts battled crime lords engaged in gunrunning, white slavery, or the drug trade, in countless movies that boosted the stock of certain stuntmen who later became action stars.     The action films of the 1960s brought into the industry a new savage rhythm that made earlier action films seem polite and stage managed. The pacing of the new action films was fast, for the narrative had been pared down to the minimum to give more time to fight sequences, which had become more realistic and more violent. In the past, dialogue usually functioned as a device for advancing the narrative; in the new action film, the camera took over as storyteller. The result was not always coherent storytelling, but in expert hands like those ofCesar Gallardo, Cirio Santiago, Efren Reyes,Pablo Santiago, or Armando Garces, the cinematographer and the editor were coming to the fore as molders of a new experience in viewing Tagalog movies. Thus, it could truly be said that the action picture was the genuinely cinematic contribution of the 1960s to the advancement of filmmaking in the Philippines.     In subsequent years, action pictures were to turn more violent as the special effects department made onscreen explosions more spectacular and destructive and car chases and smashups more dangerous and fearsome. The hero was to become less heroic and purportedly more human as, in the name of greater realism, he abandoned himself to the same sadistic, lethal impulses that his enemies regularly indulged in. However, the original thematic pattern as evolved in the 1960s remained. Justice in its legal expression as policemen and soldiers always prevailed over the forces of corruption and chaos, although one was made aware in the unraveling of the plot that the individual would need to act on his own to make it possible for good to triumph over evil.     Melodrama during this period would assert itself in two forms. First, there was melodrama that grew out of the sentimental sarsuwela narratives about faithful wives and faithless husbands, misunderstood maidens and misinformed fiancés. In the 1960s, relationships suffered and broke up because the times had ushered in mores touched by Western permissiveness and candor about sexual desire, resulting in destabilized families and amorous liaisons. Gerardo de Leon’s Huwag Mo Akong Limutin (Never Forget Me), 1960, and Cesar Gallardo’s Kadenang Putik (Chain of Mud), 1960, were early intimations of domestic disharmony within the Filipino family brought about by tensions between individual desire and social demands.     The other form of melodrama was that species most characteristic of the decade that witnessed the worldwide celebration of the sex urge in the arts as exemplified in the American hippie musical Hair (staged in Manila in the late 1960s). This was to be designated by the comic-erotic term bomba, with a hint of the taunting humor characteristic of the Filipino attitude toward sex. The bomba film was melodrama that was as moralistic as the traditional sarsuwela. Its values were as old-fashioned as those found in earlier forms of popular culture like the soap opera, the komiks novel, and the serialized novels of weekly vernacular magazines. What gave it its sensational character was the subject of sexual relations and the frankness with which the camera recorded bed scenes only coyly suggested in earlier movies.     Uhaw (Thirsty), 1970, was the first bomba, starring Merle Fernandez. It is about a woman named Lorna, her carnal “thirst,” and the two men who would quench it: her husband and her husband’s friend. The movie was an instant hit, prompting every other producer in town to outdo its sexual acrobatics. The success of Uhaw was immediately followed by Busog (Sated) and Hayok (Starved), 1970, also starring Merle Fernandez. Soon, other bomba stars appeared: Yvonne in Climax of Love, 1970, and Naked in the Dark, 1971; Rosanna Ortiz in Hayok, 1970, and Saging ni Pacing (Pacing’s Banana), 1971; Rossana Marquez in Gutom (Hungry), 1970, and Erotica, 1971; and Rizza in Nympha, 1971, which was advertised as an artistic film directed by Celso Ad. Castillo. This soft-porn trend did not produce anything that could qualify as a classic of the genre, but it was to indicate the social unrest that was reaching a peak with the advent of a new decade. The bomba was a symbolic revolt against the institutions of a corrupt society that were being attacked by young activists demanding immediate social change. Its impact on the form of subsequent Filipino films was to manifest itself in new candor in the handling of sex as an integral part of any true-to-life treatment of love relationships.     Shortly before the outbreak of the Pacific War and in the decade of the 1950s, the musical was a form of film entertainment well loved by Filipino audiences. Those were the years when the big Hollywood musicals were popular fare in Manila’s movie houses. During those years, the best Filipino composers and the best Filipino poets collaborated to turn out memorable movie theme songs that had become classics of Filipino popular music. The songs recall an era dewy-eyed with innocence and idealism. By the 1960s, the musical had degenerated into what might be characterized as a television variety show passing itself off as a movie. The affinity with television was perhaps inevitable, for the stars’ audience appeal depended on exposure time on television. Nora Aunor was boosted to stardom by winning first prize in a radio-television amateur singing contest. She entered the film industry on the shoulders of fanatical young fans won over by her television appearances. So did Vilma Santos, who kept up with rival Aunor in her TV show by compensating for her inadequacies as a singer by being a better dancer. Nonetheless, both were the big teen stars of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1970 alone, Nora Aunor topbilled 20 movies, while Vilma Santos starred in 22 movies in supporting and leading roles. Among Nora Aunor’s popular films were those she made with her screen partner Tirso Cruz III, like Nasaan Ka, Inay? (Where Are You, Mother?), 1970, Guy and Pip, 1971, and Winter Holiday, 1972. Vilma Santos, on the other hand, made several films with screen partner Edgar Mortiz, like My Pledge of Love, Love Letters, and Edgar Loves Vilma, 1970.     The horror film, which started out as a major genre in the early history of Filipino cinema, had now become an occasional novelty that producers trot out as Halloween or Christmas treat for children. Early in the 1960s, the usual format of the horror picture was that of the anthology. Different segments of the movie were handled by different directors. Gabi ng Lagim (Night of Terror), 1960, brought together directors Felix Villar, Tommy David, Pablo Santiago, and Larry Santiago. Mga Daing sa Libingan (Groans from the Grave), 1961, was the product of the combined efforts of Jose Velasco, Jose Miranda Cruz, Gil de Leon, and Armando de Guzman. The format would persist in recent years with the Regal Films production of the Shake, Rattle & Roll franchise.     Filmmaking Against the Mainstream  The 1960s reaffirmed the primacy of purely entertainment films; ironically, however, some of the better works in Philippine cinema were produced during this decade. Gerardo de Leon made Huwag Mo Akong Limutin, which stirred some controversy for its sexual content; Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo (Subversion), 1962, adaptation of the major works of the country’s national hero, Jose Rizal; The Moises Padilla Story, 1961, based on a headline story of a politician’s assassination; and Ang Daigdig ng mga Api (The World of the Oppressed), 1965, his entry in the first Manila Film Festival, arguably his best work that centers on the need for land reform. Lamberto Avellana, on the other hand, made Bus to Bataan, 1962, Scout Rangers, 1964, and A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino, 1965, his entry in the Manila Film Festival, an adaptation of Nick Joaquin’s stage play of the same title. Cesar Gallardo made his memorable films in the 1960s—notably, Kadenang Putik, a domestic drama dealing with infidelity; and Geron Busabos (Geron the Vagabond), 1964, an action-drama starring Joseph Estrada, the popular actor who would become president of the country, as the hoodlum who protects the poor and the weak in the Quiapo milieu.     The 1960s showed that films with artistic ambition had to continually compete with the more popular commercial movies. During this period, the futility of struggling to make worthy films within the commercial system was all too clear. Crass commercialism that characterized the competition among the numerous “independent” production companies forced some of the respected filmmakers out of the system. Avellana formed his Documentary Inc, producing sponsored institutional films; Gerardo de Leon engaged in making film and television commercials; Manuel Conde retired prematurely, while others disappeared from the scene or made forgettable movies. By 1970, sex films, soft-core porno films or bomba became the order of the day, together with the shallow musicals of Nora Aunor, Vilma Santos, and other teen stars. Despite the landmark films of the leading filmmakers of the period, the industry produced some of the worst in Philippine cinema. The industry was at the pits artistically when younger filmmakers broke into the industry in the 1970s. By this time, the studio heads were already gone. Doña Sisang of LVN and Doña Adela vda de Santiago of Premiere had already died in the mid-1960s. In 1975, Dr Jose Perez of Sampaguita passed away, signaling the end of the customized dream factory, the assembly line rigorously supervised by a studio head.     Since its early appearance in the Philippines, film has been seen by the government as a rich source of revenue. That it could be an effective educational tool and developed into an art form second to none in potential audience reach did not touch the consciousness of government policymakers. They continued to see film merely as entertainment for which people paid an admission fee and, therefore, a source of income for the government. Leaders of the film industry repeatedly presented facts and figures to support their appeal for relief from onerous taxation. But for as long as the Philippine government was in desperate financial straits, a situation that showed no signs of taking a good turn, relief seemed to be a far-off dream. But the industry continued to hope. Perhaps the biggest favor ever received by the industry from government was the Manila Film Festival, first sponsored by the City of Manila in 1966 as part of the celebration of the city’s Anniversary Day. For a period of 10 days in June, only Filipino movies would be shown in Manila theaters. The festival was to become an annual affair. From 1966 onward, more first-run theaters in the city opened their doors for the exhibition of Filipino films, thus correcting the earlier situation where only four theaters in the entire city showed local movies.   The increase in the number of reputable venues for Filipino movies broadened the audience for local films. College students and young professionals, who had hitherto stayed away from local movies, began to watch them, at first out of curiosity. This was to develop later into genuine interest. The times, too, were conducive to such a development. The 1960s saw the resurgence of nationalism through a social movement that had begun to popularize among the youth such phrases as “national identity,” “colonial mentality,” and “national liberation.”     The imposition of martial law in 1972 marked an era when government employed dual tactics in dealing with media which heretofore had enjoyed a wide latitude of freedom. Government tried to keep media in good humor even as they were being fettered. In the case of the film industry, state help was being dangled at the film producers in the meantime that the Board of Censors for Motion Pictures, later reorganized as the Board of Review for Motion Pictures and Television during martial law, was tightening the screws that would keep movies from being “unfriendly” to the New Society. This was the situation in the 1970s when younger filmmakers, led by Lino Brocka and Ishmael Bernal, broke into the industry.
