According to Edith L. Tiempo&rsquo;s introduction, the 35 pieces that make up this collection were written for journalistic purposes&mdash;many had appeared in the martial law-era <b><i>Focus </i></b>magazine&mdash;but they &ldquo;summon the wry and haunting evocations of the personal essay.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the first section, &ldquo;Adventures in a Forgotten Country,&rdquo; Polotan reflects on nostalgia, journeying, and encountering new faces across the country. Details from trips to provinces&mdash;the landscape, the characters on the bus rides, and the changes wrought by trends in politics and society&mdash;are carefully remembered and pondered on in &ldquo;The View from Here&rdquo; and &ldquo;To Baguio and Back.&rdquo; The physical and personal journeying begins from the airport in &ldquo;Palawan Stopover,&rdquo; a survey of the everyday life of the island, and in &ldquo;Commuter,&rdquo; where she describes flight schedules, fellow passengers, and sights upon landing in Cebu. The title essay &ldquo;Adventures in a Forgotten Country&rdquo; combines revelation and detailed description of Polotan&rsquo;s travels in Cebu, where she bids farewell to a dying man in Perpetual Succor Hospital,&nbsp;Tacloban, where she challenges a friend about the changes in Philippine culture; and Cagayan de Oro, where she ties together two ends of life when she meets a proud dollar dealer and a poor but dignified young shoemaker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second section, &ldquo;Notes on Domesticity and Other Exotica,&rdquo; opens with the &ldquo;The Wives&rdquo;: Berta from Luzon, Benita from the Visayas, and Marie from Mindanao share their struggles, their past bleak and the futures for themselves and for their families unclear. In depicting her own wedding (&ldquo;Anniversary&rdquo;) and an affair (&ldquo;A Man and a Woman&rdquo;), Polotan is gentle and introspective. The title essay is about Polotan&rsquo;s mother-in-law and Polotan&rsquo;s daughter, a generation of goats in her property, and a failed attempt to mate two pet birds. The section ends with &ldquo;After the Season,&rdquo; expressing Polotan&rsquo;s insights into the commercial culture of Christmas and leaving readers to ask, what remains of the value of gift-giving in the home?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The essays in the third section, &ldquo;Derelict Thoughts between Coming and Going,&rdquo; contain Polotan&rsquo;s signature commentary on Philippine politics, the nouveau riche and socialites, and an increasingly commercialized culture: &ldquo;The Government Paunch,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Bureaucratic Character,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Public Servant as a Fashion Plate,&rdquo; &ldquo;A Country Full of Experts,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Philippine Society in Motion.&rdquo; The vignettes in &ldquo;Derelict Thoughts between Coming and Going&rdquo;&mdash;about a trip to Cebu City to observe the Ganzon trial, survey the Opon-Mandaue bridge, and explore the district of Fuente Osme&ntilde;a&mdash;pave the way for Polotan&rsquo;s self-revelation of her place in the martial law era, a difficult time in Philippine history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last section, titled &ldquo;The Hills of Vermont,&rdquo; documents Polotan&rsquo;s transnational journeys and her encounters with Filipinos and foreigners. In &ldquo;Filipinos in America&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Midwife from Pampanga,&rdquo; questions on the trend of immigration are interwoven with poignant personal encounters.

Gawad Likhaan: The UP Centennial Literary Prize for creative nonfiction in Filipino, 2008; Madrigal-Gonzalez Best First Book Award, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This autobiography tells how Abreu matured from a curious youth activist to a full-fledged revolutionary cadre, culminating in what she calls the &ldquo;nightmare&rdquo; of 1988, when over a hundred cadres suspected of being military infiltrators were tortured and killed in an operation called &ldquo;Oplan Missing Link&rdquo; (OPML). In the prologue, &ldquo;Boots&rdquo; orders Abreu to write down how she allegedly became a deep penetration agent. Instead, she tells her readers how she became an active member of the revolutionary movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abreu&rsquo;s revolutionary roots can be traced to her mother or Nanay, whose father was a friend and supporter of the first Communist Party founded by Crisanto &ldquo;Ka Anto&rdquo; Evangelista. Through Ka Anto&rsquo;s help, Nanay learns the principles of commerce at the marketplace. Abreu is heir to Nanay&rsquo;s practical marketplace skills, which she uses in everyday life and in mass organizing and mobilizing. Abreu&rsquo;s activist phase is formally realized when she joins the Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines (SCAUP). She later learns that her comrades-to-be suspect her of being a military intelligence unit because of her advanced knowledge of societal issues. The suspicion causes the delay of her SCAUP membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abreu heeds the call of full-time activism as authorities arrest comrades and leaders. She endures a near-jail experience in rural Central Luzon, and she suffers the difficulties of managing the urban headquarters of the youth activist group Kabataang Makabayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Foreshadowing 1988, a certain comrade Karla is sentenced by a top-ranking party member to death without due process. Another chapter recounts how comrades in Davao city feel demoralized because of their leader&rsquo;s unilateral decision making. The tyrannical ways of high-ranking leaders are narrated in the next chapters. They are depicted as gangsters that purge suspected &ldquo;demons&rdquo; who threaten their leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Liwanag sa Piitan&rdquo; (Light in the Dungeon) recounts Abreu&rsquo;s arrest in Davao, her detention in the Davao City Jail, a brief stay at Fort Bonifacio, eventual transfer to Camp Bagong Diwa in Bicutan, and her subsequent escape. While she resumes her propaganda work for the party, Abreu&rsquo;s differences with the organization&rsquo;s leaders on such matters as the rule against premarital sex and the 1986 snap elections persist. Most importantly, she objects to the torture of suspects during the execution of OPML.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The final chapters continue where the memoir&rsquo;s prologue ends. Abreu is vindicated when top-level cadres argue over the correctness of OPML. Finally, in the chapter &ldquo;Bangungot sa Katanghalian&rdquo; (Nightmare at Noontime), she is released and welcomed by comrades chanting &ldquo;Long Live the Communist Party of the Philippines&rdquo; and singing &ldquo;Internationale.&rdquo; Abreu continues the struggle but now the military tries to convince her to cooperate with them. Despite being a victim of the excesses of little factions within the Communist movement that have cost the party considerable damage, Abreu expresses a sober optimism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abreu&rsquo;s book clarifies certain issues about an important period in the history of the party and counters Bobby Garcia&rsquo;s <b><i>To Suffer Thy Comrades</i></b>. The autobiography is commendable for its careful initiation of non-activists to the language and the values of the revolutionaries. It provides a moving, first-person account for the reader seeking to comprehend how a revolutionary movement rectifies itself in its attempt to fulfill its dream of a better world.

They also inquire into the discourse of names and power, such as a barangay in Rapu-Rapu called Manila; a town named after an oppressive Spanish official, Jovellar; a river called Yawa, a word that means devil; and the letter &ldquo;h&rdquo; in Albay Bikol when other varieties of Bikol have dropped it&mdash;for instance, <i>harog</i>/<i>arog</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These areas of Bikol culture, the author says, are &ldquo;not in particular circulation or are taken for granted by Albayanos and by scholars.&rdquo; The essay &ldquo;Albay Viejo,&rdquo; the book&rsquo;s central piece, uses the site of Pe&ntilde;aranda Park, the &ldquo;navel&rdquo; of old Albay, to chart the transformation not only of the space but &ldquo;attitudes.&rdquo; There are also &ldquo;brief and measured&rdquo; incursions in nearby places that had had an impact on the development of the greater old Albay district. The essay also makes use of documented historical events to explain the origin of the name &ldquo;Albay.&rdquo; In the end, though, he asserts that &ldquo;the name has no legal leg to stand on but only a memory to hang on to.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In form, <b><i>Albay Viejo</i></b> blurs the distinction between story and history, of folktale, short fiction, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\">essay</a> in what could well be an indigenous Bikol narrative form. It preserves a rich trove of Bikol words long missing from everyday discourse for contemporary use. He expresses the hope that using the Albay variant of the Bikol language&mdash;&ldquo;with all its ramifications&rdquo;&mdash;will help develop a &ldquo;truly regional Bikol language&rdquo; that is not anchored in one standard but drawn from contributions from the many languages in the region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of all, the publication of this book itself allays the Bicolnon&rsquo;s fear that, in Banzuela&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;Dai kiano man nanawalat.

Albania was the Philippines, and Conde Adolfo was the symbol of the wicked usurper. By referring to particular lines, Santos reinforces his political reading of the poem. The poem&rsquo;s subversive quality is also manifested in its exposition of the injustices perpetrated by the Catholic Church. Balagtas paints the Muslim characters in a positive light. Moreover, he did not dedicate his work to the Virgin Mary as other awit writers were wont to do, but to Celia, an earthly beloved. The third revolt lies in the social critique that Balagtas expounded.

Balagtasismo was a literary movement that looked up to the poet Balagtas, aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>, as the symbol of a pure Philippine culture. It sought to counteract American colonialism by clinging to the traditions of the pre-Spanish and Spanish colonial past. Its use of rhyme and meter was an expression of patriotism, whereas the use of free verse was deemed an act of treason. Balagtasismo reaffirmed the values of indigenous traditions, of Christianity, and the spirit of the propaganda and revolutionary movements. Thus, at this stage, the insistence on the glories of the past was a progressive stance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The resistance movement, however, gradually began to stifle the new, emerging generation of Tagalog writers, who chafed at the restriction to poetic conventions. They complained that nationalistic themes had begun to be tainted with feudalism and chauvinism, that there was no realistic nor scientific analysis of the Philippine situation, that the use of the language was puristic, and that the use of imagery was being sacrificed for a rigid rhyme-and-meter scheme. As the Balagtas school became more and more insistent on the correctness of its beliefs, it became more didactic, abstract, stilted, and stagnant. What had once been the quintessence of political activism became reactionary. The clearest example of this phenomenon was the insistence on a puristic Pilipino, which, while symbolizing Filipino nationalism, was a dead and stultifying language. Patriotism became florid sentimentalism as American colonial culture began to take root. Modernismo then emerged as the new nationalistic movement when the style and themes of balagtasismo became obsolete. Its borrowings from and adaptations of Western sources were not a sign of colonial mentality; rather, they were practical, meaningful, and creative attempts at meeting the needs of the new Filipino sensibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thus, the terms balagtasismo and modernismo, according to Almario, have undergone shifts in meaning in the course of history. What was revolutionary in one period soon became reactionary as the tides of Philippine history turned. Eventually, balagtasismo became <i>bakya </i>or popular mass literature. In the meantime, modernismo moved into the academe and, as such, alienated itself from the Filipino people because of its obscurity. However, it greatly contributed to the development of the Filipino language that was realistic and dynamic and which became the official language of youth activism as against the Pilipino being propagated by the Institute of National Language, which had become the bastion of balagtasismo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In conclusion, Almario sees the beginning of a new era of Tagalog poetry, which is a synthesis of balagtasismo and modernismo. He suggests the need for a Filipino literary theory based on a &ldquo;suspension of partisan politics&rdquo; (as against the Western &ldquo;suspension of disbelief&rdquo;) and &ldquo;political distance&rdquo; (as against &ldquo;aesthetic distance&rdquo;), which should provide for the creation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> that is meant for mass readers and mass media outlets.

About this part of his life, he recounts that his math teacher at Liceo de Manila caused him to change the spelling of his family name from <i>Macaventa</i> to <i>Macabenta</i> to make it more in keeping with the <i>baybayin</i> or native alphabet; that he had to work as a houseboy to pay for his board and lodging when he was a student; that he returned to Leyte to work as a teacher in the public school system, which the Americans were just starting to establish; and that he joined the judicial district of Tacloban three years later, working in various capacities and in different places in Leyte and Samar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of Makabenta&rsquo;s experiences with his writer-contemporaries and carousing companions <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3063\">Iluminado Lucente</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5744\">Casiano Trinchera</a>, Kikoy Enfectana, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3225\">Norberto Romualdez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2731\">Francisco Alvarado</a>, Espiridion Brillo, and Juan Ricafort, he recalls that drunk, they once broke into a house where old women were singing the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a>.

Mojares contextualizes the lives of Paterno, Pardo, and de los Reyes within historiographic and ethnological writings, historic events, and historical shifts before and during the 19th century. In the chapter &ldquo;Entangled Genealogies,&rdquo; Mojares delineates the complex results of the native encounter with European knowledge. &ldquo;The Rise of an Intelligentsia&rdquo; is an account of how colonial education and modern, voluntary associations precipitated the formation of a national intelligentsia and, eventually, the revolution. In &ldquo;Writing about Ourselves,&rdquo; Mojares demonstrates how a generation of Filipino intellectuals laid claim to knowledge, paved a way for national agency, and birthed the &ldquo;self-consciousness of the Filipino nation.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Patrick Campos</strong> </em></span></p>\r\n",

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5197\">Isagani R. Cruz</a>. Editor, David Jonathan Y. Bayot. With an introduction by the editor. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 29 essays in this collection were written by Cruz in the 1980s and the 1990s. The book is divided into four sections. The first and theoretical section deals with criticism, which Cruz labels &ldquo;Kritika.&rdquo; In six essays, Cruz offers an incisive look into what ails Philippine criticism. We are not only the West&rsquo;s Other, he avers, simply because we are powerless in the face of Western hegemony. Our critical writing is the &ldquo;Other Other&rdquo; because of its lack of identity, its pitiful reliance on Western paradigms, its inability to look at its texts on their own terms, and as importantly, its denigration of women. &ldquo;Ang Papel ng Kritiko&rsquo;t Kritika sa Ating Lipunan&rdquo; (The Role of the Critic and Criticism in Our Society) spells out in more detail the functions of a critic: decolonizing minds and problematizing various forms of hegemonic discourse, retrieving forgotten texts and reinterpreting canonical texts from an anticolonial perspective, producing more critical works, junking all forms of Neo-Universalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second section, composed of nine essays, deals with key issues in language and translation. Cruz explains the linguistic features of Filipino, underscores the importance of putting Filipino and Filipino literature in the curriculum, and demonstrates how popular texts, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novels</a> and romances, have continually vivified the language. In &ldquo;Ang Wika bilang Ideolohiya o Ang Wika ng Teorya bilang Teorya ng Wika&rdquo; (Language as Ideology or The Language of Theory as Theory of Language) and &ldquo;Kung Bakit Malabo ang Ingles pero Hindi Dapat Lumabo ang Ating Paningin / Deconstructing English as a Language for Philippine Theory: Isang Papel, Dalawang Wika&rdquo; (Why English Is Dim but Our Eyesight Should Not Be / Deconstructing English as a Language for Philippine Theory: One Paper, Two Languages), Cruz discusses the various theories of language that have been proposed in Western literary theory, exposing how deeply steeped these have been in the ideologies of the culture from which they emerged.

				"value": "The 29 essays in this collection were written by Cruz in the 1980s and the 1990s. The book is divided into four sections. The first and theoretical section deals with criticism, which Cruz labels &#x201C;Kritika.&#x201D; In six essays, Cruz offers an incisive look into what ails Philippine criticism. We are not only the West&#x2019;s Other, he avers, simply because we are powerless in the face of Western hegemony. Our critical writing is the &#x201C;Other Other&#x201D; because of its lack of identity, its pitiful reliance on Western paradigms, its inability to look at its texts on their own terms, and as importantly, its denigration of women. &#x201C;Ang Papel ng Kritiko&#x2019;t Kritika sa Ating Lipunan&#x201D; (The Role of the Critic and Criticism in Our Society) spells out in more detail the functions of a critic: decolonizing minds and problematizing various forms of hegemonic discourse, retrieving forgotten texts and reinterpreting canonical texts from an anticolonial perspective, producing more critical works, junking all forms of Neo-Universalism."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The second section, composed of nine essays, deals with key issues in language and translation. Cruz explains the linguistic features of Filipino, underscores the importance of putting Filipino and Filipino literature in the curriculum, and demonstrates how popular texts, such as <a href=\"/9/73/1557\">novels</a> and romances, have continually vivified the language. In &#x201C;Ang Wika bilang Ideolohiya o Ang Wika ng Teorya bilang Teorya ng Wika&#x201D; (Language as Ideology or The Language of Theory as Theory of Language) and &#x201C;Kung Bakit Malabo ang Ingles pero Hindi Dapat Lumabo ang Ating Paningin / Deconstructing English as a Language for Philippine Theory: Isang Papel, Dalawang Wika&#x201D; (Why English Is Dim but Our Eyesight Should Not Be / Deconstructing English as a Language for Philippine Theory: One Paper, Two Languages), Cruz discusses the various theories of language that have been proposed in Western literary theory, exposing how deeply steeped these have been in the ideologies of the culture from which they emerged. The crucial task of the Filipino scholars, therefore, is to further examine their language as constitutive of their realities."

The book is divided into six sections: &ldquo;Lives and Legends,&rdquo; a selection of profiles on&nbsp; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>, Teilhard de Chardin, Jaime Cardinal Sin, and others; &ldquo;Interesting Times,&rdquo; which deals with the country&rsquo;s changing sociopolitical situation, from imperialism to bad roads; &ldquo;Ancient and Ever New,&rdquo; which reflects on Catholicism; &ldquo;Critical Conditions,&rdquo; which examines Filipino writing, culture, and creativity; and &ldquo;Last Laughs,&rdquo; pieces without a unifying theme apart from their humor, formal ingenuity, and analyses of the post-Marcos years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Almost all these works are politically charged. One of the earliest, &ldquo;Ferdinand Marcos: An Appreciation,&rdquo; 1970, is a brilliant satirical defense of the then six-year reign of President Marcos, showcasing Brillantes&rsquo;s wit and ability to be both oblique and pointed. Both of these traits would be put to good use in the articles to follow, published during martial law, when criticism must necessarily be veiled and&mdash;this a by-product of censure and unrest&mdash;full of ingenuity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Catholicism and faith play important roles in his articles. In pieces like &ldquo;The Phenomenon of Teilhard de Chardin,&rdquo; 1967, and &ldquo;Christians for Revolution,&rdquo; 1971, Brillantes discusses the ways that certain priests and intellectuals, with or without the approval of their superiors, have succeeded in modernizing Catholicism in the 20th century. Other articles focus on the histories of events important to Catholicism and the faith in the Philippines, such as the miracles of Lourdes, and the presentation of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. Unfortunately, there are times when Brillantes&rsquo;s strong Catholic sensibility borders on exclusivity, privileging Catholic discourses on the nation over other interpretations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another prominent theme in Brillantes&rsquo;s work is his apologia for using English in the Philippines. He argues across many articles that the language has been useful for literacy, for its tradition, and for providing access to international literatures. These arguments reach their peak in his essay, &ldquo;Nick Joaquin / Quijano de Manila and Other Anomalies,&rdquo; 1978, where the &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; in the works of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a> is that his use of English and of foreign/colonial heritage makes his works every bit as Filipino, if not more so, than those by the enemies of English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The wide coverage of the book is itself one of its most interesting aspects, because a collection that spans four decades is itself a historical document revealing the evolution of Filipino consciousness. Although Brillantes is consistently sharp, witty, and political, his style and politics noticeably changed with the years. From 1967 to 1971, the articles are clearly irreverent and leftist. The aforementioned &ldquo;Ferdinand Marcos: An Appreciation&rdquo; pokes fun at the president, and &ldquo;Christians for Revolution&rdquo; asserts that Christians and Marxist-Leninists must learn from each other for the good of the country. While the irreverence is toned down somewhat at the beginning of martial law, when indirection becomes the norm, it returns again in the turbulent 1980s, and is seen best in &ldquo;The Testimony to Ninoy Aquino,&rdquo; 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1990s show a different story. In the wake of purges and the loss of a common enemy, the Left itself divided and fell apart. In the articles written in this decade, Marxists and corrupt politicians alike are targets of Brillantes&rsquo;s pen, which declares itself openly in &ldquo;Stories&rdquo; as being &ldquo;liberal, capitalist, democratic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thus, in this collection of essays of four decades, we find both the conscious concerns of the author and the heartbeat of his age, the currents of the country&rsquo;s history, hidden, interwoven, and living in the text. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Dominic Sy</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5377\">Cristina Pantoja-Hidalgo</a>. Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>Coming Home</strong></i></b> is a collection of magazine articles, newspaper columns, journal&nbsp;entries, and conference papers written over a period of time. The contents are<i> </i>varied: reminiscences, literary criticism, confessions, reviews, an interview with fictionist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5183\">Gilda Cordero-Fernando</a>, and travel essays, probably Hidalgo&rsquo;s forte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nostalgia is the keynote of much of the collection. Hidalgo revisits antique haunts and familiar faces, relives childhood pleasures and adolescent mischief, celebrates old family rituals and social ceremonies. Her essays are peopled by old teachers, maiden aunts, itinerant friends, priests and nuns, writers and academics, some of them already gone but all lovingly recollected from, and perhaps also mystified by, the magic of memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In her reminiscences, Hidalgo brings to mind, except for the suburban settings in some of them, scenes from Amorsolo&rsquo;s idylls or stills from a well-made costume drama. In &ldquo;Boomtown,&rdquo; she describes a family picnic to Tagaytay with details consisting of <i>buko</i> (coconut) juice, a hammock, bicycles, a cottage, a motel named Cliffview, a coffee farm, farmers peddling sundry vegetables and fruits, and <i>bucayo</i> (a sweet made of grated coconut meat). Hidalgo is at her best describing places, especially those that no longer are or else have been irreversibly altered. As in a pointillist painting, she lays out the details, piece by seemingly trivial piece, until she creates not just a picture but a complete mood. Her description of her family&rsquo;s old house in New Manila&mdash;from the dirt road that led to it to the rooms it contained; from the capiz-shell windows to the garden of dahlias, chichirica, begonias, bougainvillea, and yellow bells that they overlooked; from the <i>sari-sari</i> (general merchandise) store across from it to the empty lot turned basketball court beside it&mdash;evokes, rather than states, the meaning of &ldquo;home.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In some instance, the reminiscences come with a wistfulness, a mourning for the &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; that are no more. In &ldquo;Colegio,&rdquo; Hidalgo takes us back to a world without computers or calculators, video players or CDs, where leisure meant stopping by the Rizal Monument &ldquo;to watch the changing of the guard.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But these essays are more than sentimental musings about times past. Here and there Hidalgo provokes her readers to rethink the familiar. In &ldquo;Pampahaba ng Buhay&rdquo; (For Longevity), she describes a typical Sunday in Hong Kong where she and her friends are taking a break. Here she observes overseas contract workers, and she is aware of being (to quote from another of her essays in the collection) &ldquo;yet another alienated middleclass woman&rdquo; (159), identifying with the poor Filipinas in Hong Kong who are certainly not there on a vacation. In &ldquo;Pinoys Down Under,&rdquo; Hidalgo recounts the travails of being a woman; and in &ldquo;A Gentle Colonization,&rdquo; which may be the best essay in the collection, Hidalgo describes the subtle&mdash;and hence effective and ineradicable&mdash;&ldquo;colonization of the mind.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Hidalgo ceases to reminisce, she discusses literature, although even then the memories trickle in. She tells us about her influences and favorite writers, her childhood reading and favorite characters. More fascinating, however, is her account of how her stories and the novel <b><i><strong>Recuerdo</strong></i></b>, 1996,<i> </i>were conceived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The nostalgic tone ends when she reviews books. Her incisive comments reveal a keen mind, cutting without being tactless, critical without being destructive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These essays record Hidalgo&rsquo;s thoughts about various topics, but what ultimately emerges as the subject is Hidalgo herself, the woman as writer.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5732\">Macario D. Tiu</a>. With a preface by Patricio N. Abinales. Davao City: Ateneo de Davao, University Research and Publication Office. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5489\">Manila Critics Circle</a>&rsquo;s National Book Award for history, 2006. Revised edition, with an introduction and notes by the author, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book offers a broad account of Davao history, covering events from early Islamic rule, the Spanish colonization, the American occupation, World War II, the Marcos regime, and the early 21st century. In the preface, Abinales commends Tiu&rsquo;s effort to rely on local sources. Tiu states in his introduction that he is more wary of documents written by colonizers than he is of indigenous folklore, from which he finds valuable clues to the gaps and mysteries left by standard historical sources. Thus, Tiu engages with the work of foreign historians, the Muslim <i>tarsila </i>(genealogical narratives of the royalty), and the oral tradition of the Davao tribes to present an ethnography and genealogy of Davao&rsquo;s <i>lumad </i>(indigenous peoples), to portray the lives of settlers and local heroes, and to map out the story of how Davao came to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is divided into five chapters. The first chapter reveals historical highlights, discussing the archaeological finds in Talikud Island and Davao del Sur, and the early foreign presence in the Davao Gulf. The doomed Spanish fleet of <i>Santa Maria del Parral</i> becomes a takeoff point for Tiu&rsquo;s theory about the descendants of the light-skinned, European-looking Mandaya tribe currently living over the Manurigaw River. Tiu also recounts the arrival of the Basque adventurer Jose Oyanguren, who conquered Davao in 1848 after the Buayan Sultanate of the Maguindanao had lost its political sway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second chapter provides a detailed assessment of the lumad. Tiu classifies them into three main groups: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2331\">Ata</a>. More than 20 tribes&mdash;including the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, the Giangan, the Kalagan, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a>&mdash;have emerged from these groups. If the Spaniards used <i>reduccion</i>, or settlements, to subjugate the tribes that relentlessly undermined them, the Americans, according to Tiu, employed germ warfare. The tribes would resist by performing the subversive &ldquo;Dance of Labi,&rdquo; which Tiu attributes to the assassination of Gov Edward C. Bolton by Datu Mangulayon. For Tiu, unity among the tribes is a crucial solution to the threat of cultural extinction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the third chapter, Tiu describes the wave of foreign and local settlers who arrived in Davao at various periods in history. A number of migrants coming mostly from Cebu are profiled, but one particularly poignant story is that of Alex Boham, an Indonesian Sangil who came to Mindanao in 1972, seeking a better life. Tiu also traces the narrative of three generations of women: Venancia, Consolacion, and Gertrudis Verano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the fourth chapter, Tiu rescues Datu Bago&mdash;a Moro chieftain who fought against Oyanguren&mdash;from accounts that describe Bago as an oppressor. Datu Bago, Tiu argues, led the defense of the last frontier in the archipelago from colonization. Tiu also pays tribute to Alexander Orcullo, a labor group organizer, and Maria Socorro Par, a student activist, as Davao&rsquo;s heroes during the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last chapter gathers 64 myths and legends of the Davao tribes: the 12 creation stories from Ata Manobo, Bagobo, Blaan, and Tagakaolo traditions; the myth of Lumabat and Mebuyan; the contrasting tales of the Ata&rsquo;s Tulalang and the Obo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1973\"><strong>Tuwaang</strong></a>; the story of the woman chieftain Bia Layag; the Sangil legend of Gumansalangi; and the exploits of Datu Kulukog with the Ikogans (tailed men) and the Americans. The Obo Manobo legend of Apo Sandawa, a journeyman believed to be Lapulapu&rsquo;s brother, is extensively retold, ending with his death in the mountain that would be named after him. Tiu argues that the story mirrors the sea route of the Manobos from Butuan to the south. Thus, by elevating the oral tradition of indigenous Filipinos into a source for local history, Tiu not only reclaims it from conventional historiography but also adopts its worldview to reconstruct a story of the nation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by John Bengan</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Manila: World News.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The brainchild of editors Andrew K. Arriola and Grace C. Pe, the anthology features short stories, poems, and essays by Chinese Filipino writers that explore a variety of issues regarding the Chinese Filipino experience. The anthology is divided into three sections: &ldquo;The Self,&rdquo; &ldquo;Relationships,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Society.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A prominent theme that runs through the collection is the alienation experienced by Chinese Filipinos. Jane Que Tiu&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life in This Country: Through a Pair of Chinky Eyes&rdquo; narrates the author&rsquo;s personal experiences of stereotyping and isolation and her resolve nonetheless to show her gratitude to the country that has fostered her ancestors. Tiu reasserts this resolve in her short story &ldquo;Double Happiness,&rdquo; which tells the intermarriage between a Chinese woman and a Filipino man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Transplantation and the construction of ethnic identity also figure prominently in the anthology. Lao Bi Eng&rsquo;s vignette &ldquo;Soliloquy of a Gardener&rdquo; uses the roots of a tree as a metaphor for how established the Chinese identity is within the Filipino social landscape. Returning to China as the motherland is also expressed in Eddie Choa&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Home.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of works in the anthology portray family issues. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5371\">Caroline S. Hau</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Day&rdquo; tells the story of a young girl&rsquo;s discovery of her older sister&rsquo;s marital problems; R. Kwan Laurel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Father&rdquo; narrates the strained relationship between father and son; Andrew Arriola&rsquo;s &ldquo;Conflict&rdquo; tells the story of a father&rsquo;s thwarted dream of having his son continue the family business; and Grace C. Pe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Of Sons and Heirs&rdquo; comments on the preference for sons over daughters among the Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The short stories cover diverse themes and types. Aileen June Wang&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nightmare on Victual Street&rdquo; and Alice Bernice S. Ty&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Most Powerful Spell&rdquo; present tales of fantasy with underlying lessons on morality. Grace C. Pe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Last Laugh&rdquo; tells the story of ace high school students being outwitted by the school. Caroline S. Hau&rsquo;s &ldquo;Grief&rdquo; follows the endurance of a mother in the face of her husband&rsquo;s abduction by Japanese troops, and Maningning Miclat&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monitor&rdquo; narrates a day in a life of a studious and introspective schoolgirl. Finally, Serene Yu&rsquo;s &ldquo;On Johanna&rsquo;s Birthday&rdquo; and &ldquo;On His Way Home&rdquo; offer short impressionistic tales of childhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poems are equally diverse.

Pe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Behold Thy Son&rdquo; tells of a mother&rsquo;s inability to rectify her son; Lelly Go Tiu&rsquo;s &ldquo;Holding On&rdquo; and Genevieve Go Khoe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ordinary People&rdquo; express continuing faith in the face of difficulties. Finally, other poems by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5514\">Mario Miclat</a> and Wang depict moments of introspection on the nature of life and existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The essays focus on the relationship between the Chinese Filipino community and the broader ethnic Filipino society as well as on the development of Filipino and Chinese Filipino literature. Mario Miclat&rsquo;s &ldquo;China Impressions and Other Stories&rdquo; discusses the extensive history and the richly diverse culture of China, which in turn yields a wealth of impressions about the country. Albert Lim&rsquo;s &ldquo;Filipino-Chinese: Are We or Are We Not?&rdquo; points out that the alienation of Chinese Filipinos is due to the differences, misunderstandings, and the mutual distrust between the two groups.

Editors, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5242\">Jaime de Veyra</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5602\">Mariano Ponce</a>. Serialized in <b><i>El</i></b><i> <b>Ideal</b></i>,<b> </b>16 Mar 1911&ndash;15 Mar 1912. Reprinted, with a prologue by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5238\">Epifanio de los Santos</a>, Manila: Imprenta y Libreria de I. R. Morales, 1914. These articles were translated into Filipino by Edgardo M. Tiamson, Teresita A. Alcantara, and Edwin L. Bautista, annotated by Ma. Luisa T. Camagay, and published by the University of the Philippines Diliman&rsquo;s Office of Research Coordination in 1998 using the original title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Efemerides</i></b><i> <b>Filipinas</b> </i>is a series of articles on historical events with social or patriotic interest. A brainchild of Jaime de Veyra, the articles were published daily in the newspaper <b><i>El</i></b> <b><i>Ideal</i></b>.<i> </i>De Veyra had toyed with the idea of a society and its monthly magazine that would promote folklore. When this failed, he decided to undertake this monumental project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the project, de Veyra sought the help of many scholars, writers, and educators. However, except for Mariano Ponce who had written on Bulacan folklore, they did not share de Veyra&rsquo;s enthusiasm. Nevertheless, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5557\">Rafael Palma</a>, Arsenio Luz, Rafael Corpus, and Epifanio de los Santos did contribute one article each; Leoncio Gonzalez Liquete, three. Writing alternately, de Veyra and Ponce provided the daily articles. De Veyra&rsquo;s style was literary, whereas Ponce wrote in the clipped journalistic style of the press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first article, appearing on 16 Mar 1911, focused on the discovery of the Philippines by Fernando Magallanes in 1521. The last article, dated 15 Mar 1912, was a summons to folklorism. Generally, the topics revolved around history, folklore, customs and traditions, literature, and achievements of Filipinos, the goal of which was to counteract Americanization.

Apparently, Santos heeded Viray&rsquo;s advice, and the story as it has come to be published starts with Fil. The process is mutual, for in several letters Viray asks Santos for his opinion on his (Viray&rsquo;s) works.

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press. Gintong Aklat Award for social science.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i><strong>El Folk-Lore Filipino</strong></i> </b>is a two-volume work of folklore materials that Isabelo de los Reyes compiled, retold, amplified, wrote, and originally published in Manila in 1889 and 1890. According to the translators of this edition, de los Reyes set out to collect folklore to prove that the natives were already civilized even before the Spanish colonizers came to their shores. His book groups folklore materials from the provinces of Ilocos Sur, Zambales, and Malabon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his introduction, de los Reyes explains the need for gathering accurate information; he then provides an overview of the scientific bases of folklore. He asserts that the work of collecting popular knowledge is a patriotic duty. In the short note that follows, &ldquo;Folklore Terminology,&rdquo; he problematizes the Western scholars&rsquo; use of the term &ldquo;folklore&rdquo; and makes two important statements that shed light on his own stance as a scholar: First, he calls himself a &ldquo;brother of the forest dwellers,&rdquo; or the Filipino peoples that have not been totally reached by Spanish rule. Second, he asserts that such a project that he is undertaking should &ldquo;limit the use of foreign words&rdquo; and the &ldquo;tendency to overuse them.&rdquo; Hence, his work uses native terms extensively and leaves them untranslated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first and longest section, further subdivided into three chapters, is on Ilocano folklore. The first chapter contains information on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> religion, mythology, and psychology. There are entries on elementals and creatures like the <i>mangmangkik</i>, <i>katatao-an</i>, <i>kaibaan</i>, <i>litao</i>, and <i>pugot</i>; and on popular calendars and feasts. The second chapter is on Ilocano types, customs, and traditions. The third chapter is on Ilocano folk literature and offers a selection of poems by the author&rsquo;s mother, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5298\">Leona Florentino</a>, besides a good number of other poems, compositions, and notes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second section, and the shortest in the volume, is devoted to two aspects of Zambales folklore, particularly those pertaining to death and marriage. The third section is on Malabon folklore, which puts together entries on popular beliefs, riddles, medicines, love affairs, and <i>ondas</i> (All Saints&rsquo; Day). It includes a lengthy appendix that provides information on the location, transportation, industry, and commerce of Malabon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The content, form, and style of writing employed in <b><i>El Folk-Lore Filipino</i></b> is mixed and varied, but the goal is one: to &ldquo;gather popular data about the illiterate and simple people,&rdquo; which for de los Reyes is &ldquo;the true definition&rdquo; of folklore. The original work, written in Spanish, won a silver medal at the Madrid Exposition and other prizes at the expositions in Paris, France, and Saint Louis, USA. In this edition, the original Spanish text by de los Reyes and the English translation are published on facing pages.  <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Patrick Campos</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

He asserts that the work of collecting popular knowledge is a patriotic duty. In the short note that follows, &#x201C;Folklore Terminology,&#x201D; he problematizes the Western scholars&#x2019; use of the term &#x201C;folklore&#x201D; and makes two important statements that shed light on his own stance as a scholar: First, he calls himself a &#x201C;brother of the forest dwellers,&#x201D; or the Filipino peoples that have not been totally reached by Spanish rule. Second, he asserts that such a project that he is undertaking should &#x201C;limit the use of foreign words&#x201D; and the &#x201C;tendency to overuse them.&#x201D; Hence, his work uses native terms extensively and leaves them untranslated."

Mojares</a>. Pasig City: Anvil Publishing, Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is a collection of Mojares&rsquo;s essays, most of which first saw print in his column &quot;Footnotes to an Absent Text&quot; in 1989-96. The pieces are thematically grouped according to parts of a house: &ldquo;Door,&rdquo; &ldquo;Foyer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Grand Hall,&rdquo; &ldquo;Corners and Corridors,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gallery,&rdquo; &ldquo;Refectory,&rdquo; &ldquo;Study,&rdquo; &ldquo;Anterooms,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Private Rooms.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sole essay in &ldquo;Door&rdquo; states that the book &ldquo;is not a house built according to plan.&rdquo; It explains the makeshift structure of the book, indicating that its purpose, like that of a house, is to create meaning out of the space that its materials enclose. Herein, too, lies its craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Foyer&rdquo; presents the author&rsquo;s creative process and articulates his reason for keeping a column (&ldquo;Writing a Column&rdquo;)&mdash;that articulating a thought is laying claim to it (&ldquo;Casting Stones into the Sea&rdquo;), despite the elusive nature of memory&mdash;as a way of &ldquo;keeping what time (and, worse, inattention) erodes.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Grand Hall&rdquo;<i> </i>contains sprawling narratives commonly stricken out of textbooks, such as the powerful role that pre-Hispanic women played in matters of sex (&ldquo;Visayan Erotica&rdquo;) and the validation of the human body by our ancestors before anything that is flesh was reconditioned as &ldquo;evil.&rdquo; Mojares reconsiders history from the point of view of the native&rsquo;s system of beliefs instead of the colonizer&#39;s.

In Benito Lim&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Burial,&rdquo; the return of Hsin to attend his grandfather&rsquo;s funeral reveals a long-standing family problem of living with undesirable relatives. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5541\">Charlson Ong</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mismanagement of Grief,&rdquo; the wake becomes a venue for the family to wash their dirty linen in public as they express their own grudges against one another. In Grace Pe-Bacani&rsquo;s &ldquo;Starting Over&rdquo; and Gad S. Lim&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sunday Dinner,&rdquo; family members defy tradition in the process of dealing with pressure and indifference to each other. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5454\">Paul Stephen Lim</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Taking Flight&rdquo; is also about being oppressed by the rules and expectations of one&rsquo;s family.

Don&rsquo;t Tell Stories to a Child like Wei-Fung!), Wei-Fung is deceived by his own adopted son Beng-Hua&mdash;a departure from the usual theme of a Chinese being deceived by a Filipino. On the other hand, Tian-Huay Q. Tan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Spring Wind Blows Immensely at the Nipa Hut&rdquo; recounts the cooperation among the Filipino Chinese during World War II as they helped each other escape the atrocities of the Japanese Imperial Army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5040\">Jaime An Lim</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Homing Mandarin, or After the First Death There Are Others,&rdquo; a patriarch leaves his second family in the Philippines to return to his first wife and family in China.

The personae in the first two poems immerse themselves in their Chinese beliefs and customs in order to feel more grounded despite living in a foreign land. In Manipon&rsquo;s poem, the Chinese Filipino desires to break free from the dictates of tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The essays replay the themes of displacement and struggling to find one&rsquo;s place: &ldquo;Growing Up Chinese in the Philippines&rdquo; by Jacqueline Co, &ldquo;Where I Came From&rdquo; by Doreen Yu, and &ldquo;W.A.S.P.&rdquo; by Jonathan Chua. &ldquo;Both Sides Now&rdquo; by Michael L.

By these very qualities, however, did the book make available heretofore inaccessible and incomplete materials&mdash;the lore of the people instead of official knowledge&mdash;and so move toward its goals of &ldquo;understanding and reconstructing scientifically the history and culture of a people.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taking off from de los Reyes, Mojares exhumes interesting precolonial and colonial tales, such as those about head-hunting and notions of shame; and about the writings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5602\">Mariano Ponce</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5306\">Gabriel Beato Francisco</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The transformation of the social, political, economic, cultural, and spiritual lives of Filipinos under colonial rule is a dominant theme of the collection. In &ldquo;Maidens Shrouded in Darkness&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Woman Named Virgin Mary,&rdquo; Mojares sketches the transformation of native women, from being lively epic chanters to being meek and mournful copies of the Virgin Mary, from being a &ldquo;binukot&rdquo; in a secluded space to being a nun in the cloister. Similarly, essays like &ldquo;Densities of Time,&rdquo; &ldquo;Remembering the Body,&rdquo; &ldquo;The <b><i>Arithmetica</i></b> of Rufino Baltazar,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Traveling Filipino&rdquo; all show the effects of colonialism on, respectively, the local sense of time and space, the body and dance, counting, and travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mojares shows, however, that the transformation wrought by colonialism cuts both ways. &ldquo;Isabelo&rsquo;s Almanac,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ilocanizing Verdi,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Notes for the Production of a Brechtian Komedya&rdquo; explain how the European forms like the almanac&nbsp;can be localized and made to speak on the native&rsquo;s behalf, as a means of social and political criticism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collection also reveals Mojares&rsquo;s interest in the &ldquo;unwritten, unfinished, fantastical, fictitious, and apocryphal&rdquo; stories and events of Philippine history and culture. These stories, lost from the collective memory of the people, are generative of new knowledge and ideas. &ldquo;Tales of Manilamen&rdquo; digs up accounts of Filipino seafarers, like Vicente B. Macanaya, whose career as aide-de-camp of the American buccaneer Frederick Townsend Ward is nothing short of &ldquo;cinematic.&rdquo; In &ldquo;Musica Moralia,&rdquo; Mojares recounts the touching story of a Filipino band performing loud and vigorous music for fellow Filipinos throughout the Spanish attack in Lian, Batangas. &ldquo;A Poem of All the Names of the Rivers&rdquo; depicts the struggles of the Subanens (or the &ldquo;river people&rdquo; inhabiting the Zamboanga peninsula) against deforestation, land-grabbing, and the incursions of outsiders and the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most intriguing piece in the collection is &ldquo;The Book That Did Not Exist.&rdquo; The Augustinian botanist Manuel Blanco is said to have holed himself up in his cell to write on the history and character of the <i>indio </i>(native). When Blanco died, the book that he was supposedly laboring on was found to contain nothing but blank pages. Mojares proposes several interpretations: the blank pages may suggest that the natives are a <i>tabula rasa</i>, or that there was so much about the natives that the Spaniards did not know. They may also imply that this country remains underwritten and under-theorized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mojares&rsquo;s collection creates the archive on which one may draw in order to fill the gaps in the Philippine precolonial and colonial history.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5640\">Jun Cruz Reyes</a>. With a foreword by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5358\">Ramon Guillermo</a>. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book is a reconstruction of the life and times of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5372\">Amado V. Hernandez</a>, a subject that Reyes considers fitting for a new <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> epic. In his foreword, Guillermo describes the biography as a necessary work that reintroduces the legendary writer to the masses to whom he had devoted his life and art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the core of this reintroduction is the biographer&rsquo;s interrogation of who controls the discourse on the life of Hernandez. Reyes&rsquo;s introductory essay, &ldquo;Ang Pangangapa&rdquo; (Groping), recounts how he faced the discursive and political complexities of biographical representation, particularly because he wanted to contextualize the writer&rsquo;s life and relate it to the issues of nationalism, history, and literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is divided into three parts. The first part, &ldquo;Ang Paghahanap&rdquo; (The Search) recounts the biographer&rsquo;s foray into the genealogical, geographical, ethnological, and literary jungles. Beginning with his search for the lost bust of Hernandez in his hometown Hagonoy, Reyes traces the writer&rsquo;s lineage to the first poet of the clan, Lakandula, and to nationalist writers from Bulacan like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco &quot;Balagtas&quot; Baltazar</a>. The affinities among them are furthered strengthened in his discussion of the poetics of wit and sorrow in Hernandez and the tradition of grief and satire in local literature. Reyes claims Hernandez as a son of his hometown Hagonoy. He intercuts this genealogical discovery with an account of his own plight as a writer haunted by the specter of state terrorism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second part, &ldquo;Ang Pagsusulat sa Nahanap&rdquo; (Writing the Discovered), is a multilayered narration of Hernandez&rsquo;s life, from his birth in Tondo in 1903 to his death in 1970. Reyes chronicles Hernandez&rsquo;s engagement with the political upheavals of his time from Hernandez&rsquo;s beginnings as a young writer enamored of provincial life and the idea of the barrio lass as ideal woman to his eventual transformation as the poet of the working class. The narrative recounts the writer&rsquo;s early pacifist and pragmatist leanings, his participation as a spy for the American forces during World War II, his radicalization in the labor movement, his imprisonment and eventual canonization by the state, and his engagement with the younger revolutionaries of the First Quarter Storm era. Against the historical backdrop of Hernandez&rsquo;s political awakening, Reyes paints a passionate portrait of the writer&rsquo;s marriage with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Honorata &ldquo;Atang&rdquo; de la Rama</a>, who supported him in his political activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the last part, &ldquo;Ang Pagbasa sa Naisulat&rdquo; (Reading the Written), Reyes returns to his search for the lost monument. Discovering that the man himself is the monument, he ruminates on the need for one to situate Hernandez&rsquo;s life within the project of imagining the nation and to write more biographies as an antidote to historical amnesia. Toward the end of the biography, Reyes succeeds not only in finding the lost bust but also in reconstructing the monument upon the very platform on which Hernandez&rsquo;s heroism is built, which is, after all, literature. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Laurence Marvin Castillo</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Bernad, SJ, wrote prolifically on Philippine literature and culture. <b><i>The King&rsquo;s Phrase</i></b> collects 22 of his essays, reviews, lectures, and addresses, dating from the 1950s to the 1990s, some previously published, many revised and augmented for this collection. These writings are grouped into four sections: Philippine literature in English (divided into &ldquo;General Perspectives&rdquo; and &ldquo;Particular Perspectives&rdquo;), Philippine vernacular language and literature, Old Manila, and Philippine bibliography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book opens with his by now classic, though perhaps also disproved, observation, made in 1958: that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1536\">Philippine literature</a> lacks a &ldquo;theological dimension,&rdquo; in that it is not &ldquo;one that raises questions dealing with the ultimate meaning of human existence.&rdquo; Bernad is quick to state that he is stating a fact and not finding fault. Though this view may now be considered quaint, his next essay, on the sociological aspects of Philippine literature in English, is still instructive. Bernad presents the facts that make up the conditions of production and consumption of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1544\">Philippine literature in English</a>, and predicts an attenuated future for it. Given its diminishing readership relative to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> literature, Bernard concludes that, having &ldquo;started as the venture of a small minority; it may be heading back in that same direction.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The bulk of the book consists of Bernad&rsquo;s reviews, some of them expanded or adapted.

Of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Cave and Shadows</i></b>, 1983, Bernad comments that it is proof that Nick Joaquin is &ldquo;one of the best Filipino writers in English&rdquo; and that Joaquin also tended toward theatrical, if not histrionic, writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bernad is perhaps most engaging when he is commenting on Filipino writers in English like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5131\">Gregorio Brillantes</a> (&ldquo;a writer with depth&rdquo;), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5138\">Carlos Bulosan</a> (&ldquo;to put it bluntly, he told lies&rdquo;), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5344\">N.

When he steps outside the province of Philippine literature in English, he champions literature in the local languages in his reviews of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1953\">Sugbuanong Balak</a>&nbsp;/ Cebuano <strong>Poetry</strong></i></b>, 1988; <b><i><strong>Epic</strong>s of the Philippines</i></b>, 1983; and <b><i><strong>Awit</strong> and Corrido</i></b>, 1987.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;To Borrow the King&rsquo;s Phrase: The Philippines as a Multilingual Society,&rdquo; one finds the source of the book&rsquo;s title. In an address to the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, the king of Spain praises the efforts of the academy in preserving Castillan, but he also calls for the development of other languages of Spain. Similarly, Bernad urges scholars to turn their attention to the Philippine languages. In line with that vision, the book includes his reviews of Visayan dictionaries and a book on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> culture, and his notes on the &ldquo;dignity and beauty in the vernacular languages.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his essays on Manila before World War II, Bernad crams historical trivia, rumors, literary quotation, and word pictures taken from his mental archive.

Bernad&rsquo;s essays are the works of an amateur (<i>amÄ�tor</i>, lover), written not out of professional obligation but out of love for the labor of reading and writing itself. Bernad eschews jargon, but his criticism is informed by classical principles (for example, in his analysis of Bulosan&rsquo;s &ldquo;authenticity,&rdquo; he is drawing on Aristotle), appeals to common sense, and exudes a disarming honesty. For instance, in his review of a biography of Gregorio Aglipay, he refers to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5667\">Alfrredo Navarro Salanga</a>&rsquo;s piece, &ldquo;which I confess I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>The King&rsquo;s Phrase</i></b> is testament to and summation of Bernad&rsquo;s lifelong engagement with Philippine literature beyond <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1578\"><b><i>Bamboo and the Greenwood Tree</i></b></a>, 1961. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Garcellano proffers a polemical and theoretically nuanced Marxist critique. In each of the book&rsquo;s three sections, Garcellano demonstrates the interrelatedness of literary studies, Philippine Marxism, and popular nationalism. At the same time, he problematizes Marxism, in light of the &ldquo;crisis within the Philippine Left.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The essays in the first section, &ldquo;Critique,&rdquo; are concerned with the structures and contexts of literary production and critical practice in the Philippines. &ldquo;Post-EDSA Literature and Marxist Discourse&rdquo; critiques the triumphalist and, for Garcellano, misguided politicization in Philippine literature centered on the so-called EDSA revolution and the figure and assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr. &ldquo;Reportage on the State of Class War and Philippine Poetry&rdquo; analyzes the complexities of &ldquo;committed writing,&rdquo; with a view to distinguishing it from formalism, nihilism, adventurism, nativism, and non-dialectic and ahistorical writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Acknowledging that &ldquo;the Left today is under siege,&rdquo; Garcellano theorizes in &ldquo;Reading the Revolution, Reading the Masses&rdquo; on the notions of &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;masses.&rdquo; &ldquo;Philippine Hermeneutics and the Kingpins of the Hill&rdquo; critiques the &ldquo;depoliticization of mainstream literary discourse&rdquo; and the institutional networks that perpetuate such a state. Criticized are writers who negate nationalism and the class war through their &ldquo;metaphysizing&rdquo; of language and identity. &ldquo;Marxism, Feminism and Literary Text: &lsquo;The Difference of View, the Difference of Standard&rsquo;&rdquo; theorizes on the relationship between Marxism and feminism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second section of the book, &ldquo;(Re)Reading,&rdquo; is focused on specific literary productions. &ldquo;A Way of Reading for the &rsquo;80s&rdquo; reads Rogelio Sikat aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5698\">Rogelio Sicat</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tata Selo&rdquo; (Old Man Selo) against <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s and Gabriel Garcia Marquez&rsquo;s novels. &ldquo;<b><i><strong>Bamboo</strong> in the Wind</i></b> and the Strategy of Containment&rdquo; problematizes the subject position of novelist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5345\">Azucena Grajo Uranza</a> and the realism of her novel,<i> </i>which, for Garcellano, &ldquo;romances&rdquo; the elite and &ldquo;contains&rdquo; the masses, a fact that ultimately negates the novel&rsquo;s purported revolutionary politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Garcellano reads the unrealized political project of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5565\">Panulat para sa Kaunlaran ng Sambayanan</a> or PAKSA, organized in the 1970s, in &ldquo;A Reductive Letter to Imaginary Warriors: Or, Minor Subversion for Our Times.&rdquo; In the essays &ldquo;Speaking from the Margin of Margins&rdquo; and &ldquo;Partisan Poetry: A Metacriticism,&rdquo; he analyzes works by feminist writers and &ldquo;warrior-poets,&rdquo; respectively. &ldquo;<b><i>Gera</i></b> and Its Readers: Or, the Cadre versus the Academic&rdquo; evaluates the reading strategies and various reading positions that draw meaning out of Red fighter Ruth Firmeza&rsquo;s novel, <b><i>Gera </i></b>(War), 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The last section, &ldquo;Criticism,&rdquo; consists of short pieces that deal with cultural events, historiography, and critical writings. &ldquo;The EDSA Drama as Literary Text: A Possible Reading&rdquo; reconsiders the EDSA event as a literary text that &ldquo;has given rise to the middle-class myths.&rdquo; In &ldquo;A Choice of Film Review (Or, Reviewing the Reviewer),&rdquo; Garcellano argues that the filmmaker, though informed by his or her social class, can strive to exceed the roles assigned to him or her by the industry and society. In &ldquo;The Fiction of History,&rdquo; Garcellano assesses the treatment of the events from 1896 to 1906 by various historians. In &ldquo;The Arrogance of Imaginary Power,&rdquo; he critiques the critical writings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5033\">Virgilio S. Almario</a>. &ldquo;Of Theorizing Anti-Theorists, Nativists and Literary Shitheads&rdquo; contends that nativism, in its refusal to engage with &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; theory, is a kind of anti-intellectualism. Finally, &ldquo;The Filipino as Critic in a Time of War&rdquo; reiterates what Garcellano thinks is the task of criticism: to &ldquo;partake of the urgency of partisan deployment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Taken together, the essays are, as Garcellano puts it, a &ldquo;metacritique of current discursive practices of the idols of the marketplace who have long steered the public toward the so-called neutral, non-ideological and pure positions.&rdquo; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Patrick Campos</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

To address this gap, Lim offers a critique of nine Philippine novels organized around variations on the theme of colonial experience. Accordingly, Lim categorizes the novels according to the demarcations of Philippine colonial history. The three key chapters are titled &ldquo;In the Shadow of the Cross and the Sword: The Spanish Regime, 1565-1898,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Changing of the Guard: The American Period, 1899-1946,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hour of the Rising Sun: The Japanese Occupation, 1941-1945.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the first chapter, Lim reads <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></i></b> (Touch Me Not), 1887; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5748\">Linda Ty-Casper</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Three-Cornered Sun</i></b>, 1979; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5405\">F.

Being written in the thick of the Spanish regime by an author who was at the time struggling to imagine the future of the nation, <b><i>Noli</i></b>, asserts Lim, was guarded and unwilling to dismiss the competing possibilities of response for and against Spain, favoring instead the embodiment in novel form of the dialectics of opposites and strategies. Ty-Casper, in contrast, can afford, given her distance from the events she recounts, to flesh out the dramatic motivations of the &ldquo;common people&rdquo; of the revolution against Spain, people who cry out against oppression but who are also tempted into tyrannies. Jose&rsquo;s novel, set at the juncture between the Spanish and American colonial periods, narrates the genesis of national consciousness, which was merely incipient at the time that Rizal was writing his novel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the second chapter, Lim focuses on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5415\">Maximo M. </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5415\">Kalaw</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Filipino Rebel</i></b>, 1930; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5443\">Juan C.

In flowery Ilocano, Real presents interesting details on the education of Leona&mdash;the rudiments from her parents, especially her mother Do&ntilde;a Isabel; Spanish and Latin from Fr Evaristo Abaya; and a year&rsquo;s secondary schooling at the Colegio de Santa Isabel in Manila. Other biographical data include the occasion for writing her poem &ldquo;Emilia&rdquo;; her temper over admirers, especially a captain of the <i>guardia civil</i>; her marriage to Elias de los Reyes; and her being a mother to Isabelo. In providing a milieu to Leona&rsquo;s life story, Real culls notes from history, particularly the Malong Revolt of Pangasinan, the Silang Revolt, the Ambaristo Revolt, the ouster of Gov Carlos Maria de la Torre, and the execution of the three priests Gomez, Zamora, and Burgos, the last being Leona&rsquo;s neighbor in Ciudad Fernandina.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The author maintains that these historical events could have passed unnoticed in the mind and writing of Leona.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5014\">Tomas F. Agulto</a>. With a foreword by June L. Rodriguez and an introduction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5676\">Romulo A. Sandoval</a>. Gapas Foundation Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book is a multi-genre collection divided into three sections of 5 essays, 24 poems, and 5 stories. The works depict the lives of the fisherfolk, whose working conditions, according to Sandoval in his introduction, cannot be comprehended in economic terms alone but must be seen in the context of the power relations between classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first section consists of travel essays, though these are a far cry from mere accounts of sightseeing adventures in exotic places. With a poet&rsquo;s eye for color and detail, and a storyteller&rsquo;s knack for characterization and structure, the author shares with the reader the life stories of fisherfolk in Palawan, Marinduque, Tawi-Tawi, Batanes, and his hometown Hagonoy, Bulacan. In each essay, the history of the region and the culture of its people are interwoven with the narrative, so that their dignity and humanity shine through in their struggle for survival. Himself a fisherman, Agulto has the ability to make the fine distinctions between the different fishing methods and equipment used in these regions, and the precise vocabulary for describing them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Buhay-Piskador&rdquo; (A Fisher&rsquo;s Life) summarizes the history of <i>muro-ami</i>, a Japanese fishing method brought into the Philippines in pre-World War II years. It follows the life of a muro-ami diver who, at age 13, is recruited in Cebu and taken to Palawan. His harrowing life at sea ends only because the loss of his arm in a boat accident sets him free to return to Cebu. &ldquo;Sa Bulubunduking Pulo ng mga Mangingisda&rdquo; (In the Mountainous Islands of Fisherfolk) captures the contradictions of Marinduque island, where a family of fisherfolk live on a mountaintop and young fishermen hope for employment at the Marcopper Mining Corporation, while the elders unrelentingly lodge protests against the same corporation for the pollution and damage it has caused. &ldquo;Ang mga Badjao ng Tungkalang&rdquo; (The Badjaos of Tungkalang) focuses on a specific community to present a tapestry of Badjao mytho-history and traditions. Specific circumstances, like military operations and Tausug raids on their village, compel them to live an itinerant life. &ldquo;Ivatan&rdquo; begins with the description of illegal fishing practices by the Taiwanese in the Batanes seas. Ivatan culture is portrayed through the life stories of the doggedly hardworking Lolo Magno and the exuberantly garrulous Mr Gabotero. Agulto&rsquo;s fifth, and last, essay is &ldquo;Kariton at Kabayanihan&rdquo; (Cart and Courage), which is a montage of testimonials about Ka Sonny and the victims of the Mendiola Massacre. The images evoked by their survivors&rsquo; narratives counter the celebratory images of the post-martial law government of Corazon Aquino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The next section consists of personal and political poems, a number of which evoke nostalgia even as they poke fun at the inefficiency of the education system. We read about naughty elementary kids who smell like the sea, evading the efforts of their elders to discipline them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the struggles of the fisherfolk are sketched in the poems, they are elaborated on in the stories. In &ldquo;Sa Bakuran ng Komprador&rdquo; (At the Comprador&rsquo;s Backyard), young Abe must choose between joining the fisherfolk association led by his Ninong Julio and joining the vigilante group to be set up by Konsehal Galida, who wants to maintain his political clout. The story illustrates that the cultural complicates the political. Abe &ldquo;owes&rdquo; Galida not money but a debt of gratitude, or <i>utang na loob</i>. In &ldquo;Putot&rdquo; (Shorty), old Tata Ilyong is caught in a similar dilemma&mdash;in his case between joining the New People&rsquo;s Army and joining the government&rsquo;s military forces. Both stories force young Abe and old Ilyong to choose between fence-sitting and affiliating with the party that they find just.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The collection&rsquo;s title story ends the book. Nana Lagring, a devotee of Sta. Elena, hears rumors that her missing son is an informant. A wandering woman resembling Sta. Elena and named Ka<i> </i>Elena (Comrade Elena) invites her to a revolutionary camp. The visit strengthens her faith both in the mercy of Sta. Elena and the justness of the ongoing revolution. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by&nbsp;<strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5200\"><strong>Rosario Cruz-Lucero</strong></a></strong></strong> and Arbeen Acu&ntilde;a</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

With a poet&#x2019;s eye for color and detail, and a storyteller&#x2019;s knack for characterization and structure, the author shares with the reader the life stories of fisherfolk in Palawan, Marinduque, Tawi-Tawi, Batanes, and his hometown Hagonoy, Bulacan. In each essay, the history of the region and the culture of its people are interwoven with the narrative, so that their dignity and humanity shine through in their struggle for survival. Himself a fisherman, Agulto has the ability to make the fine distinctions between the different fishing methods and equipment used in these regions, and the precise vocabulary for describing them."

				"value": "&#x201C;Buhay-Piskador&#x201D; (A Fisher&#x2019;s Life) summarizes the history of <i>muro-ami</i>, a Japanese fishing method brought into the Philippines in pre-World War II years. It follows the life of a muro-ami diver who, at age 13, is recruited in Cebu and taken to Palawan. His harrowing life at sea ends only because the loss of his arm in a boat accident sets him free to return to Cebu. &#x201C;Sa Bulubunduking Pulo ng mga Mangingisda&#x201D; (In the Mountainous Islands of Fisherfolk) captures the contradictions of Marinduque island, where a family of fisherfolk live on a mountaintop and young fishermen hope for employment at the Marcopper Mining Corporation, while the elders unrelentingly lodge protests against the same corporation for the pollution and damage it has caused. &#x201C;Ang mga Badjao ng Tungkalang&#x201D; (The Badjaos of Tungkalang) focuses on a specific community to present a tapestry of Badjao mytho-history and traditions. Specific circumstances, like military operations and Tausug raids on their village, compel them to live an itinerant life. &#x201C;Ivatan&#x201D; begins with the description of illegal fishing practices by the Taiwanese in the Batanes seas. Ivatan culture is portrayed through the life stories of the doggedly hardworking Lolo Magno and the exuberantly garrulous Mr Gabotero. Agulto&#x2019;s fifth, and last, essay is &#x201C;Kariton at Kabayanihan&#x201D; (Cart and Courage), which is a montage of testimonials about Ka Sonny and the victims of the Mendiola Massacre. The images evoked by their survivors&#x2019; narratives counter the celebratory images of the post-martial law government of Corazon Aquino."

				"value": "While the struggles of the fisherfolk are sketched in the poems, they are elaborated on in the stories. In &#x201C;Sa Bakuran ng Komprador&#x201D; (At the Comprador&#x2019;s Backyard), young Abe must choose between joining the fisherfolk association led by his Ninong Julio and joining the vigilante group to be set up by Konsehal Galida, who wants to maintain his political clout. The story illustrates that the cultural complicates the political. Abe &#x201C;owes&#x201D; Galida not money but a debt of gratitude, or <i>utang na loob</i>. In &#x201C;Putot&#x201D; (Shorty), old Tata Ilyong is caught in a similar dilemma&#x2014;in his case between joining the New People&#x2019;s Army and joining the government&#x2019;s military forces. Both stories force young Abe and old Ilyong to choose between fence-sitting and affiliating with the party that they find just."

In &ldquo;Tragic Temperament,&rdquo; written in Feb 1930, Mangahas decries the arguments that the Americans were using to extend colonial rule, arguments, he wrote, that were channeled through secondary education. He thus anticipates <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5181\">Renato Constantino</a>&rsquo;s critique in the 1960s of American colonial education. In &ldquo;A Psalm of Thanks,&rdquo; Mangahas enumerates the &ldquo;blessings&rdquo; which &ldquo;afflicted&rdquo; the country in 1928, including &ldquo;the abdication of leadership and intelligence in favor of cunning and the pork-barrel, which is another shining evidence of our political maturity.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Literary matters figure in a number of the essays.

Irony, hyperbole, understatement, reductio ad absurdum, and the occasional ad hominem attack are used to cut down to size giants, such as presidents Emilio Aguinaldo and Manuel Quezon: &ldquo;We should take pride in the moral versatility of our public officials.&rdquo; For added punch, Mangahas wittily turns popular and literary phrases around, including those from Scripture: &ldquo;While they [reformers] are the salt of the earth, we are not always aware of their ability to improve the savor of things.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">American &ldquo;benevolence&rdquo; is a myth Mangahas enjoys exploding. He welcomes an American statesman&rsquo;s proposal that American communists be deported to an island in the archipelago, as it would make the Philippines &ldquo;a happy dumping place for intellectual and social pariahs.&rdquo; To an American senator&rsquo;s suggestion that the Philippines be sold to Germany, he remarks, &ldquo;We have been sold so many times I don&rsquo;t see why we should raise any objections to being sold again&hellip;. America should succeed: she is the greatest salesgirl in the world.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Behind the writings a personality emerges&mdash;urbane, informed, perceptive, critical of vanity, ignorance, hypocrisy, and self-importance, but not blind to its own foibles. However, readers may miss many of Mangahas&rsquo;s references because of the topical nature of columns and the absence of annotations. Still, the essays offer today&rsquo;s readers evidence of why his columns were much admired in his time and give today&rsquo;s columnists a standard against which to measure what they churn out. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemheadLIT\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">(From the Golden Lighthouse: Literary Criticism). Published 1969. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5249\">Clodualdo del Mundo Sr</a>. With an introduction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5162\">Celso Al. Carunungan</a>. Manila: Liwayway Publishing Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is the first compilation of essays of literary criticism in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>. Till the publication of the book, literary criticism had been confined to the pages of some magazines, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5458\"><b><i>Liwayway</i></b></a><i> </i>and<i> <b><strong>Malaya</strong></b></i>,<i> </i>to the pamphlets published by the then Institute of National Language (later called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5426\">Surian ng Wikang Pambansa</a>), and occasionally, to some anthologies edited, for example, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5007\">Teodoro A. Agoncillo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/4999\">Alejandro C. Abadilla</a>. Contextualized against the existing body of critical texts, the book was an ambitious project: it studied the different aspects of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/72/1536\">Philippine literature</a> and popular culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Del Mundo&rsquo;s studies on poetry exemplify a critical tendency shaped by a romantic view of literature, as manifested in the initial work, &ldquo;Tatag ng Kahapon, Dahas ng Ngayon, Pangako ng Bukas&rdquo; (Sturdiness of the Past, Violence of the Present, Promise of the Future). The two essays on Abadilla encapsulate the terms of the debate between him and the latter over the poem <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1835\">&ldquo;Ako ang Daigdig&rdquo;</a> (I Am the World), which del Mundo claims is not a poem. Del Mundo offers glimpses not only of the personalities of artists but also of different movements. His studies on the significance of the Panitikan movement remain crucial to a fuller understanding of it. As important as his essays on literature are the pieces on various aspects of popular culture&mdash;film, radio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><b>komiks</b></a>.

Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Caroline Hau&rsquo;s book argues for the continued significance of critical and interpretative practice, especially with regard to explicating the nation. More specifically, the book looks into the relationship between literature and nationalist discourse, especially the various roles they play in the production of one another, through a critical reading of canonical texts against the backdrop of the conflicts of their particular historical situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Hau&rsquo;s method involves locating certain &ldquo;excesses,&rdquo; or what she describes as &ldquo;the heterogenous elements &hellip; that inform, but also exceed, nationalist attempts to grasp, intellectually and politically, the complex realities at work in Philippine society.&rdquo; She makes it clear that these excesses are irreducible by-products of the nationalist project, and so the response to their identification should not be a poststructuralist abandonment of the nation, but rather a collective effort toward more sophisticated analyses of nationhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;The Problem of Consciousness,&rdquo; Hau discusses how Philippine nationalism has been premised on the idea that the discovery of truth is a prerequisite to action. Education, of which literature plays an important part, creates the proper conditions for the formation of a nationalist character. However, Hau eventually questions this binary between truth and action, and shows how the latter also brings access to the former in a dialectical process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;The Fiction of a Knowable Community,&rdquo; Hau uses <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s attempt to make Filipino society &ldquo;knowable&rdquo; in his novels to show how any construction of a Filipino community will always fail to capture the heterogeneous elements of the people. Rizal&rsquo;s position as being both inside and outside the nation gave him an advantage over previous European critics of the Philippines. However, his position also made it even more difficult to inscribe the complexities of the various populations and groups that comprise the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Literature and History,&rdquo; Hau shows how <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1267\"><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></a></i></b> and Ileto&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1641\"><strong>Pasyon</strong></a></strong></i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1641\"><b><i> and Revolution</i></b></a>, 1979, oppose rigid dichotomies of &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; and &ldquo;native&rdquo; in their constructions of syncretic and dynamic conceptions of key players in Philippine history&mdash;a Hispanicized bourgeoisie in Joaquin&rsquo;s case and a mass-based folk Christian millenarianism in Ileto&rsquo;s. While &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; elements are the excesses of more nativist narratives of Philippine history, however, both Joaquin and Ileto have their own excesses&mdash;the masses and the quotidian excess of certain millenarian rituals, respectively&mdash;that destabilize their own constructions of Philippine history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Alien Nation,&rdquo; Hau argues that the Chinese are displaced from Philippine history in that the contradictions of the Filipino nation-state&mdash;formal political equality and enormous economic inequality&mdash;are systematically displaced onto the Chinese. Through a critical reading of various representations of the Chinese, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5634\">Edgardo M. Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1796\"><b><i>Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</i></b></a><i> </i>(In the Claws of Light), 1967,<i> </i>she shows how Filipino nationalism constructs Filipinos as a unity&mdash;where divisions of class, gender, and so forth are de-emphasized&mdash;in opposition to an alien and alienating Chinese Other, whose alienness is characterized by differing citizenships and the closeness to capital. The necessary reexamination of the place of the Chinese in the Philippines thus becomes a reexamination of Filipino nationalism itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Authorizing the Personal and the Political&rdquo; attacks dominant forms of criticism in Philippine Literature in English, especially biographical criticism, epitomized in the readings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5600\">Kerima Polotan</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1743\"><strong>The Hand of the Enemy</strong></a></i></b>, 1962. This form of reading privileges an unproductive either-or tendency that declares an author (and so her work) either &ldquo;clean&rdquo; (&ldquo;good&rdquo;) or &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; (&ldquo;bad&rdquo;). In contrast, Hau argues for a &ldquo;theory of ethical practice&rdquo; that would simultaneously look for the symmetry between an author&rsquo;s life and her texts while avoiding using the author as a source of deep (and total) meaning. The author is used as one of many structuring principles through which a text is determined, along with its social, political, historical, and ideological conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;The Unfinished Revolution,&rdquo; Hau looks into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>&rsquo;s memoirs and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5138\">Carlos Bulosan</a>&rsquo;s novels to show how any grand theory or construction of Philippine history necessarily runs aground when faced with the quotidian histories and excesses of everyday people. This makes it impossible to use history to predict the future. On the other hand, the necessity of projecting the nation into the future&mdash;for nationalists as a whole, but especially for Marxists and leftists, who imagine a revolution&mdash;is the very condition for the existence of both nations. Thus, the inability to completely and accurately predict the future is important because it emphasizes the reality that one cannot be completely sure of any prediction, and so necessitates more careful attentiveness in planning and action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;The Politics of Criticism&rdquo; analyzes how the issues of error and criticism have been central to the formation, development, and survival/strength of the Communist Party of the Philippines, as seen in its changing strategies and policies. The practice of self-criticism is also seen in their method of producing literature, as seen in the creation of Mano de Verdades Posadas&rsquo;s <b><i>Hulagpos </i></b>(Breaking Free). From this, Hau argues, firstly, that the inevitability of error is not a reason for defeatism but is rather the necessary condition of struggle; it merely necessitates further and better criticism. Secondly, she argues that the collaborative process in creating <b><i>Hulagpos</i></b> shows how literature always works within a complex field of production involving audience, critic, writer, and so forth. Thus, literature is neither &ldquo;history&rdquo; (extraliterary propaganda) nor purely &ldquo;self-expression&rdquo; but is rather something that is worked through collectively. This emphasizes a different understanding of &ldquo;intellectuals,&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;people,&rdquo; as being always in a state of transformation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Dominic Sy</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

This form of reading privileges an unproductive either-or tendency that declares an author (and so her work) either &#x201C;clean&#x201D; (&#x201C;good&#x201D;) or &#x201C;dirty&#x201D; (&#x201C;bad&#x201D;). In contrast, Hau argues for a &#x201C;theory of ethical practice&#x201D; that would simultaneously look for the symmetry between an author&#x2019;s life and her texts while avoiding using the author as a source of deep (and total) meaning. The author is used as one of many structuring principles through which a text is determined, along with its social, political, historical, and ideological conditions."

This makes it impossible to use history to predict the future. On the other hand, the necessity of projecting the nation into the future&#x2014;for nationalists as a whole, but especially for Marxists and leftists, who imagine a revolution&#x2014;is the very condition for the existence of both nations. Thus, the inability to completely and accurately predict the future is important because it emphasizes the reality that one cannot be completely sure of any prediction, and so necessitates more careful attentiveness in planning and action."

The practice of self-criticism is also seen in their method of producing literature, as seen in the creation of Mano de Verdades Posadas&#x2019;s <b><i>Hulagpos </i></b>(Breaking Free). From this, Hau argues, firstly, that the inevitability of error is not a reason for defeatism but is rather the necessary condition of struggle; it merely necessitates further and better criticism. Secondly, she argues that the collaborative process in creating <b><i>Hulagpos</i></b> shows how literature always works within a complex field of production involving audience, critic, writer, and so forth. Thus, literature is neither &#x201C;history&#x201D; (extraliterary propaganda) nor purely &#x201C;self-expression&#x201D; but is rather something that is worked through collectively. This emphasizes a different understanding of &#x201C;intellectuals,&#x201D; as well as the &#x201C;people,&#x201D; as being always in a state of transformation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Dominic Sy</strong> </em>"

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book traces the origins of the Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a> back to the precolonial epics, with which the country&rsquo;s narrative tradition began. In the study, Mojares shows how a common narrative tradition persists despite the powerful influence of the Western novel. This local tradition comes from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballads</a>, folktales, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><b>pasyon</b></a>,<b> </b>lives of saints, <b>korido</b>,<b> </b>and the moral and social tracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mojares&rsquo;s analyses of the novels take into account their intrinsic elements and devices as well as their historical, biographical, and cultural context. These diachronic (or historical) and synchronic (or generic) levels of analyses reveal the two types of impulses that inform the Filipino novel: on the one hand is the didactic, romantic, and aesthetic impulse, and on the other is the fictional, realistic, and empirical impulse. Mojares first discusses the different indigenous narrative forms, focusing on the epic. He then notes how the epic was transmuted with the influx of Spanish colonialism. The next section deals with the different narrative forms derived from Spain, such as the pasyon,<b> </b>which replaced the epic, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a> called <b>awit</b> and korido, and the conduct books. He concludes that the impulse behind these different forms was didacticism, in line with the Spanish mission to Christianize the Philippines. However, he notes that there was also a growing tendency toward empiricism. Mojares then discusses the emergence of the novel in the propaganda movement during the late 19th century. The works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5237\">Isabelo de los Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">M. H. del Pilar</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> are examined, the empirical impulse in them highlighted. Mojares links the rise of empiricism to several sociopolitical developments; among them were increased cultural contact with Europe and the rise of an educated class, of which Rizal was a member. The succeeding sections deal with the novel in the local languages. Mojares explains its flourishing as a result of the populace&rsquo;s increased national consciousness, the rise of secularism and more free thought, the removal of publishing restrictions and a growing reading public, and the fact that English was still foreign to most Filipinos while Spanish was declining. Having discussed works by the first novelists of the twentieth century, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5306\">Gabriel Beato Francisco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K.

It is attributed largely to commercialism, which encouraged improvisory writing. Turned into a &ldquo;market commodity,&rdquo; these novels suffered from repetition and formlessness. After discussing the works of writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5313\">Fausto J. Galauran</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5548\">Sulpicio Osorio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5125\">Flaviano P.

First, it is characterized by polygenesis; that is, it is the synthesis of literary and extraliterary factors. Second, it has a syncretic form; that is, it is the descendant and, therefore, a mixture of many literary forms that came before it.

Abad uses the phrase to refer to the native ground, whose fairness colonization has dimmed.

The poet tills foreign soil to make &ldquo;a native clearing.&rdquo; Thus, the Filipino poet writing in English is indeed Filipino, though the medium is a colonial language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Amador T. Daguio: A Turning Point in Filipino Poetry <i>from </i>English&rdquo; Abad points to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5208\">Amador Daguio</a>&rsquo;s<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1902\"> &ldquo;Man of Earth,&rdquo;</a> 1932, as a high water mark in the shift from writing in English to writing from English: the persona in Daguio&rsquo;s poem asserts his power to define who he is (&ldquo;I am man of earth&rdquo;), in defiance of what &ldquo;they say&rdquo; he is (&ldquo;I might have been the bamboo&rdquo;). &ldquo;Inang Bayan Our Muse: Early Filipino Poets in English, 1905-1924&rdquo; surveys early Philippine patriotic and socially committed verse in English. &ldquo;&lsquo;That Mighty Eagle&rsquo;: America in Filipino Verses in English, 1905-1945&rdquo; provides one explanation for the current ambivalence toward America. In the poems of the period, American atrocities during the Philippine-American War are glossed over, and the kinship between America and the Philippines during World War II affirmed. However, the meanings that &ldquo;America&rdquo; assumed in the imagination of Filipino poets&mdash;&ldquo;Freedom and Democracy, Progress and Justice, Fair Play and World Peace&rdquo;&mdash;have ironically also created a space for a criticism of America as a nation that falls short of its promise and promises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In two essays, &ldquo;The Filipino Romantic: Moral and Religious, Melancholic, Sentimental, Fantastic, and Descriptive Verse&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Filipino Romantic: Amorous and Erotic Verse,&rdquo; Abad notes how Filipino poets adopted English Romantic poetry and gave it a Filipino stamp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Fernando M. Maramag, Poet and Critic&rdquo; is an overview of Maramag&rsquo;s work as a site where matter and medium struggle, the poet aware of his own pursuit of a space within English in which to forge his own thoughts. The epilogue, &ldquo;A Sense of Country: Our Body Poetic,&rdquo; argues that the sense of country is a &ldquo;yearning for form&rdquo; and a product of &ldquo;imagination in and through language upon our own ground&rdquo;; thus, it is poets, having mastered language, whether native or colonial, who &ldquo;create our sense of country.&rdquo; Moreover, a Filipino reader &ldquo;will always read into the text by a Filipino author his own experience as a Filipino.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Our Scene So Fair</i> </b>is intended as a companion to Abad&rsquo;s anthologies of Philippine poetry in English, from which he draws copious examples and extensive quotations. In a way, it is Abad&rsquo;s apologia for a literature written in a colonial language. If what matters is what the poet does with language and not the language per se, then, Philippine writing in English (or Spanish) is as much Filipino as writings in the native languages. In fact, Abad argues, using an adopted language may be a more critical act of forging a native clearing than writing in a native language where the writer may be lulled into assuming the &ldquo;innocence&rdquo; of native words. On the other hand, Abad is aware that such an approach to poetry in English is partly an effect of reading: Maramag&rsquo;s poem, for instance, was originally intended as a celebration of Dewey&rsquo;s victory, but it lends itself to an ironic interpretation when it is read in light of present experience and present understanding of Philippine history. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The epilogue, &#x201C;A Sense of Country: Our Body Poetic,&#x201D; argues that the sense of country is a &#x201C;yearning for form&#x201D; and a product of &#x201C;imagination in and through language upon our own ground&#x201D;; thus, it is poets, having mastered language, whether native or colonial, who &#x201C;create our sense of country.&#x201D; Moreover, a Filipino reader &#x201C;will always read into the text by a Filipino author his own experience as a Filipino.&#x201D;"

In a way, it is Abad&#x2019;s apologia for a literature written in a colonial language. If what matters is what the poet does with language and not the language per se, then, Philippine writing in English (or Spanish) is as much Filipino as writings in the native languages. In fact, Abad argues, using an adopted language may be a more critical act of forging a native clearing than writing in a native language where the writer may be lulled into assuming the &#x201C;innocence&#x201D; of native words. On the other hand, Abad is aware that such an approach to poetry in English is partly an effect of reading: Maramag&#x2019;s poem, for instance, was originally intended as a celebration of Dewey&#x2019;s victory, but it lends itself to an ironic interpretation when it is read in light of present experience and present understanding of Philippine history. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em>"

The book introduces readers to the theoretical elements, roots, and wisdom of the form, and moves from the oral tradition to the written trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first three chapters discuss the basic rhyming elements and patterns, the third focusing specifically on local poetic forms: the <b>tigsik</b>,<i> </i>a toast; <b>ariwaga</b>,<i> </i>or proverbs, which use local elements of work or nature; and <b>patood</b>,<i> </i>or riddles, which have double meanings, usually playful, if not naughty. The third chapter also discusses foreign poetic forms, such as the sonnet, villanelle, and rondelle, written in the Bikol languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chapter 4 focuses on the meter of the rawitdawit. The author shares here his opinion regarding the Spanish influence on the Bikol aesthetic. This chapter acts as a bridge to the next chapters, which mostly revolve around figurative language and content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fifth chapter discusses line schemes and the elements of the <b>pasaysay</b> (narrative), <b>paladawan</b> (images/abstractions), and <b>halo </b>(a mixture of both narrative and images).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sixth chapter illustrates how some contemporary authors have broken away from or satirize the elements of the traditional or Spanish-influenced rawitdawit. The penultimate section takes the readers to the poetics and theories of the author as applied to sample poems by contemporary Bikol writers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5581\">Frank Pe&ntilde;ones</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5182\">Kristian Cordero</a> of Iriga.

The book <b><i>Paz Marquez Benitez: <strong>One</strong> Woman&rsquo;s Life, Letters, and Writings</i></b>, written by her daughter, offers glimpses into the private life behind the public figure. Drawing on her mother&rsquo;s letters, journals, scrapbooks, diaries, &ldquo;notes scribbled &hellip; on scraps of paper, on the backs of old receipts, bills, lists, used envelopes,&rdquo; as well as from her own store of memories and letters from friends and relatives, Licuanan presents us with the tapestry of Benitez&rsquo;s colorful life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is divided into three parts. The first two alternate excerpts from Benitez&rsquo;s letters and Licuanan&rsquo;s narrative accounts. The third part excerpts from Benitez&rsquo;s diaries and journals. The book also contains a folio of photographs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;The Years of Youth, 1894-1929&rdquo; recounts Benitez&rsquo;s girlhood in Tayabas, her hometown and her encounter with the culture wrought by Americanization and colonization. The most interesting portion of the first part is her romance with Francisco Benitez, who would be her husband for 38 years. Licuanan describes their married life as a &ldquo;happy meeting of contrasting but congenial personalities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;The Golden Years, 1930-1939&rdquo; forms the bulk of the book and presents the &ldquo;high tide&rdquo; of Benitez&rsquo;s life as wife, mother, and professional. Her letters to Licuanan, then studying in the United States, recount domestic happenings&mdash;birthdays, weddings, parties&mdash;but also advert to the burning issues of the period&mdash;the national language, Philippine independence, and religious instruction in schools. In this section, one almost eavesdrops on the conversations between Benitez and the major players of Commonwealth-era Philippines:&nbsp; Sergio Osme&ntilde;a, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5659\">Carlos Romulo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5546\">Camilo Osias</a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5416\">Teodoro Kalaw</a>, and especially Quezon. The other half of this section consists of Benitez&rsquo;s letters to Francisco, mostly about her travels in Europe and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The troubled times that came after, which would bring on loss&mdash;of property, friends, an entire way of life&mdash;are the preoccupation of much of the third section, titled &ldquo;The Years of Change, 1940-1983.&rdquo; The entries during the war years are short, some only a sentence long. The enormity of the war and the Japanese occupation is conveyed not by images of bloodshed or violence but by observations quietly and briefly noted: &ldquo;Everybody seems to be baking their own bread these days now that <i>pan de sal</i> costs P5.00 each.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Licuanan remembers how her mother&rsquo;s farmer instincts saved the family from starvation. Benitez turned the swimming pool into a fishpond and raised vegetables. Milk for her grandchild (Licuanan&rsquo;s firstborn) came from the goats that she tended herself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The years after World War II were to bring another loss: that of Francisco, in 1951. Except for her initial &ldquo;wild weeping,&rdquo; Benitez&rsquo;s grief, Licuanan recounts, was silent. It is in her writings that one senses the extent of her grief. In a note addressed to her dead husband, she writes, &ldquo;Dear, it is so easy, in a way, to love the dead. They are so silent, so undemanding.&rdquo; Benitez herself would die 32 years later, in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book allows her to come alive again. More than presenting her as &ldquo;the author of &lsquo;Dead Stars,&rsquo;&rdquo; it shows us Benitez as independent thinker, a romantic but also a realist when the times demand swift action, an artist sensitive to life&rsquo;s beauty and its miseries and always able to give these verbal expression. Readers see her dancing the foxtrot, in a <i>terno</i> posing for the <b><i>Philippines Herald</i></b>, playing the classics on an old Steinway, among antiques and paintings, tending a garden of jacarandas, petunias, dahlias, chrysanthemums, and an ancient tamarind tree&mdash;all perhaps just trivial information to some people but clues to one remarkable woman&rsquo;s personality and to an era&rsquo;s mores. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Readers see her dancing the foxtrot, in a <i>terno</i> posing for the <b><i>Philippines Herald</i></b>, playing the classics on an old Steinway, among antiques and paintings, tending a garden of jacarandas, petunias, dahlias, chrysanthemums, and an ancient tamarind tree&#x2014;all perhaps just trivial information to some people but clues to one remarkable woman&#x2019;s personality and to an era&#x2019;s mores. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&#xA0;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em>"

Quezon City: Sentro ng Wikang Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is an anthology of studies&mdash;a book excerpt, two books, and a lecture&mdash;on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> poetry by Fray Gaspar de San Agustin, Fray Francisco Bencuchillo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose P. Rizal</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5688\">Lope K. Santos</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;De la Poesia Tagala&rdquo; (On Tagalog Poetry) is from San Agustin&rsquo;s <b><i>Compendio de la Lengua Tagala</i></b> (Summary of the Tagalog Language), 1703. The excerpt discusses the characteristics of Tagalog syllables, Tagalog meter, and root words with a stretched H sound. San Agustin remarks that Tagalog poetry is not so difficult as it seems, and that, unlike Spanish poetry, it does not have strict rules. He observes that Tagalog poems typically have three to six lines, with seven to eight syllables per line; however, he adds, some lines, like those of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><b>comedia</b></a>,<i> </i>have 12-14 syllables. He affirms the existence of the early forms of Tagalog poetry&mdash;namely, <b>talingdao</b>,<b> soliranin</b>,<b> diona</b>,<b> oyayi</b>,<b> </b>and <b>auit </b>(<b>awit</b>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Arte Poetico Tagalo</i></b> (Art of Tagalog Poetry), 1895, by Bencuchillo discusses 37 items, and begins with the statement that Tagalog poetry is neither easy nor difficult. Like San Agustin, Bencuchillo claims that Spanish is the more sophisticated language, possessing harmony and rhythm, which he thinks Tagalog lacks. He affirms San Agustin&rsquo;s observations on the length of Tagalog poems and Tagalog verse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rules of Tagalog poetry are far better explained in Rizal&rsquo;s <b><i>Arte Metrica del Tagalog</i></b><i> </i>(The Metrical Art of the Tagalog), 1887. Rizal notes that the common number of syllables per line is between 6 and 12, with a break after the sixth or seventh syllable in a 12-syllable line; that the occasional <i>tuldik</i>,<i> </i>or accent marks, on the last syllables do not harm the poem; and that there are 12 kinds of rhymes, including the monorhyme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos&rsquo;s lecture, &ldquo;Peculiaridades de la Poesia Tagala&rdquo; (Characteristics of Tagalog Poetry), 1929, is in part a review of previous studies on Tagalog poetry. Except for the work of Fr Joaquin de Coria, Santos criticizes the efforts of the Spanish friars as being biased. He notes that one of the &ldquo;peculiarities&rdquo; of Tagalog poetry is its mournful character, which he traces to the poets&rsquo; colonial experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos considers <b>tugma</b><i> </i>(rhyme), <b>sukat</b><i> </i>(meter), <b>talinghaga</b> (metaphor), and <b>kariktan</b> (beauty) as the four elements of Tagalog poetry. The first two comprise the structure; the latter two, the soul of poetry. The lengthiest discussion is devoted to rhyme: every stanza must have monorhyme, which is built on vowels, not consonants. There may be alliteration among words within lines. As for meter, Santos affirms previous findings on line length and the <b>sesura</b><i> </i>(caesura) at the middle of the line. He adds that later Tagalog poetry uses 14 and 16 syllables per line, with a pause sometimes occurring after every four syllables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book makes available to modern readers early attempts to codify Tagalog poetry. Almario balances perspectives, with San Agustin and Bencuchillo representing the efforts of the Spanish missionaries to understand the poetics and language of the Tagalog, and Santos and Rizal representing the nationalist spirit in pointing out the indigenous elements and features of Tagalog poetry. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5049\">Rebecca T.

The excerpt discusses the characteristics of Tagalog syllables, Tagalog meter, and root words with a stretched H sound. San Agustin remarks that Tagalog poetry is not so difficult as it seems, and that, unlike Spanish poetry, it does not have strict rules. He observes that Tagalog poems typically have three to six lines, with seven to eight syllables per line; however, he adds, some lines, like those of the <a href=\"/7/55/456\"><b>comedia</b></a>,<i> </i>have 12-14 syllables.

Deriada</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5723\">John Iremil E. Teodoro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5346\">Vicente G. Groyon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5721\">Alicia Tan-Gonzales</a>, Isabel D. Sebullen, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5066\">Genevieve Asenjo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5713\">Alice M. Sun-Cua</a>. Cruz points out that these writers use ethnicity, language, spectacle, gossip, cartography, pornography, and other technologies to disrupt cultural homogenization, which is the handiwork of the nation-state and of the global order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Deriada&rsquo;s story &ldquo;Dam,&rdquo; the main character Dumpit tries to save his community from foreign incursion by digging a channel with his bare hands to redirect the course of the river. Cruz interprets this scene as the use of native knowledge and technology against national and global cultural dominance. The dam represents technology that the natives hold some mastery over; thus, it is also a metaphor for West Visayan writers&rsquo; attempt to negotiate with and counter the national and global cultural forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This resistance comes in various shapes: Groyon&rsquo;s novel, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1807\"><strong>The Sky over Dimas</strong></a></i></b>,<b> </b>2003, uses gossip, pornography, and cartography. The main character, who is based in Manila, constructs the image of his home island Negros and the Philippines through bits of unreliable information or gossip. Cruz calls this &ldquo;illegitimate history,&rdquo; which is simultaneously a unifying and divisive force. On the other hand, the &ldquo;damming&rdquo; in Tan-Gonzales&rsquo;s short story &ldquo;Esperanza&rdquo; comes in the form of a &ldquo;secret message&rdquo; that has to be torn into pieces and flushed down a toilet as an act of resistance to the Japanese forces during World War II. It is this story from which Cruz takes the word &ldquo;pungsod,&rdquo; which literally means &ldquo;group of the same kind of trees&rdquo; and which Tan-Gonzales uses to refer to the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cruz notes that Teodoro privileges the native in the series of place names composing the title of his book <b><i>Maybato, Iloilo, Taft Avenue, Baguio, Puerto</i></b>, 2003. &ldquo;Maybato,&rdquo; the first word in this title, is a town in Antique. Additionally, Teodoro rejects the traditional but exclusionary construction of the nation as &ldquo;Appari to Jolo&rdquo; by using the phrase, &ldquo;Batanes to Jolo&rdquo; instead. Finally, Teodoro&rsquo;s use of &ldquo;Visayan-laced Filipino,&rdquo; as espoused by Leoncio Deriada, counters the prevailing assumption that Filipino as the national language is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> based. Thus, Teodoro&rsquo;s act of rewriting the language and the nation to foreground West Visayas is a blurring of the line between margin and center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Short stories by Sebullen and Asenjo deconstruct region and nation as binary opposites. In Sebullen&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang mga Birhen sa Masulog&rdquo; (The Virgins of Masulog), a doctor and National Bureau of Investigation agent returns from Manila to her home barrio to catch a criminal. Triumphant, she promises to build a school there, thus demonstrating that the national capital defines the periphery by its own terms. In contrast, Asenjo&rsquo;s &ldquo;taga-uma@manila&rdquo; shows two characters from the same provincial hometown reconnecting in Makati as neighbors, thus countering the city&rsquo;s threat to ethnic identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Sun-Cua&rsquo;s collection, <b><i>Chartered Prophecies</i></b>, 2002, the foregrounding of Chinese Filipinos presents the nation as a global entity. In two of her poems, travel is a metaphor for constructing a nation. In &ldquo;Grandmother (After a Visit to Lunghou, Chingkiang, China),&rdquo; the persona experiences a sense of dual origins and belonging. In &ldquo;Neighbor&rsquo;s Thoughts upon Seeing the Visitor from Lu-Sung,&rdquo; foot binding becomes a metaphor for the complex weave of commonalities and differences between a young woman and her grandmother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The West Visayan writings analyzed in <b><i>Pungsod</i></b> present a regional construct of a national community. Hence, to refer to the nation as &ldquo;pungsod&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;inang-bayan&rdquo; (motherland) is, for Cruz, to recognize both the singular and plural character of the Philippine nation. For West Visayan writers to think in these terms is for them to &ldquo;dam&rdquo; their native and regional resources and rechannel them toward a more inclusive notion of the nation. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5093\">John E.

Cruz interprets this scene as the use of native knowledge and technology against national and global cultural dominance. The dam represents technology that the natives hold some mastery over; thus, it is also a metaphor for West Visayan writers&#x2019; attempt to negotiate with and counter the national and global cultural forces."

The main character, who is based in Manila, constructs the image of his home island Negros and the Philippines through bits of unreliable information or gossip. Cruz calls this &#x201C;illegitimate history,&#x201D; which is simultaneously a unifying and divisive force. On the other hand, the &#x201C;damming&#x201D; in Tan-Gonzales&#x2019;s short story &#x201C;Esperanza&#x201D; comes in the form of a &#x201C;secret message&#x201D; that has to be torn into pieces and flushed down a toilet as an act of resistance to the Japanese forces during World War II. It is this story from which Cruz takes the word &#x201C;pungsod,&#x201D; which literally means &#x201C;group of the same kind of trees&#x201D; and which Tan-Gonzales uses to refer to the nation."

Additionally, Teodoro rejects the traditional but exclusionary construction of the nation as &#x201C;Appari to Jolo&#x201D; by using the phrase, &#x201C;Batanes to Jolo&#x201D; instead. Finally, Teodoro&#x2019;s use of &#x201C;Visayan-laced Filipino,&#x201D; as espoused by Leoncio Deriada, counters the prevailing assumption that Filipino as the national language is <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> based.

Triumphant, she promises to build a school there, thus demonstrating that the national capital defines the periphery by its own terms. In contrast, Asenjo&#x2019;s &#x201C;taga-uma@manila&#x201D; shows two characters from the same provincial hometown reconnecting in Makati as neighbors, thus countering the city&#x2019;s threat to ethnic identity."

The first essay, &ldquo;Towards a Revised History of Philippine Literature,&rdquo; presents the historical background and sets the theoretical framework for the study of Philippine literature.

Lumbera also discusses the political nature of popular culture and the dilemmas of the Filipino writer.

				"value": "The book is divided into three parts. The first part contains essays on Philippine literature and theater, the second deals with cinema and popular culture, and the third contains reviews of particular works. The first essay, &#x201C;Towards a Revised History of Philippine Literature,&#x201D; presents the historical background and sets the theoretical framework for the study of Philippine literature. The method is dialectical, exploring the development of Philippine literature within the context of the country&#x2019;s experience of colonialism, war, revolution, and class relationships."

				"value": "Lumbera&#x2019;s framework is further elucidated in the other essays in parts 1 and 2, where he discusses and demonstrates its application to more specific areas of Philippine literature and culture, such as literary criticism, local language literature, drama, and film. Lumbera also discusses the political nature of popular culture and the dilemmas of the Filipino writer. In part 3, the essays comment on <a href=\"/9/9/5748\">Linda Ty-Casper</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/9/77/1788\"><b><i>The Peninsulars</i></b></a>,<i> </i><a href=\"/9/9/4999\">Alejandro G.

Barred by the friars from seeing Governor-General Weyler who was in the convent, the women refused to leave unless they were allowed to present their letter of request to Weyler. Weyler finally gave the women an audience and approved their school.

Rizal notes that by struggling to free themselves from the servitude of ignorance and superstition, and by standing firm in such a struggle, they have made themselves worthy examples for all Filipinos. Rizal then goes on to attack the spiritual authority of the friars which has brutalized Filipino mothers. Such an influence, he says, has only resulted in sons who are cockfighters and acolytes, servants of the parish priests; and in husbands who, upon falling in love, would throw away learning, honor, and wealth as if a girl could only inspire misfortune. He then makes a comparison between the religious conduct of these parish priests and that of Jesus Christ, whom they are supposed to represent and emulate.

With a foreword by &ldquo;Ka Bino&rdquo; and an introduction by Elias de la Cruz. Metro Manila: Kilusan sa Paglilinang ng Rebolusyonaryong Panitikan at Sining sa Kanayunan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Labor leader and revolutionary figure Cesar &ldquo;Tatang&rdquo; Lacara&rsquo;s two-part autobiography covers the formation of the first unions in the 1930s to the liberation movements during the Japanese occupation and the founding of the &ldquo;new&rdquo; Communist Party of the Philippines in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first part, &ldquo;Hindi Pa Tapos ang Kwento: Mula Bacnotan hanggang Tondo&rdquo; (The Story Has Not Ended: From Bacnotan to Tondo), recounts Tatang&rsquo;s difficult life from his youth as a working child to his ascent as a revolutionary leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tatang&rsquo;s story begins in La Union in northern Luzon. After his five-year-old sister Loreta dies from cholera, their mother takes the family to Central Luzon. Eleven-year-old Cesar takes on different jobs to help put food on the table. When his father&rsquo;s dead body is brought home from the woods, Cesar gives up hope of finishing school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">He ends up working in Hacienda Carmencita and gets his dose of exploitative labor practices. Tatang has to work 16 hours daily to earn enough to feed his family. The farmworkers eventually organize a union in 1930 to demand higher wages and better working conditions. As one of the leaders, Tatang is offered a bribe by the landlord and his agriculturists, which he rejects. As tensions rise, the hacienda owners seek intervention from the Philippine Constabulary. The union leaders are arrested. Eventually released, they are nonetheless fired from the hacienda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Witnessing the injustices spurs Tatang to join the Communists and continue to organize workers and peasants. His efforts are interrupted by World War II. After the war, he intensifies his organizing efforts while the state intensifies its own anticommunist campaign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In one such operation in the early 1950s, Tatang is captured. Released in 1961, he resumes his organizing work, this time in urban Tondo. Frequent clashes with state authorities force Tatang to keep moving, first to Constitutional Hill (now Batasan Hills), then to the Manila-Rizal border, the Cordilleras, Ilocos Sur, and, finally, to eastern Central Luzon. The first part ends with asseverations of his commitment to the struggle for justice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second part, &ldquo;Sari-Saring Sanaysay&rdquo; (Various Essays), recounts key stages of his journey in the revolutionary movement. In &ldquo;Ang Cabiao&rdquo; (Cabiao), Tatang recalls the show of <i>damayan </i>(empathy) among the peasants working in the hacienda of the Buencaminos in Tarlac: when one is deprived of his harvest, all farmers go on strike. &ldquo;Ang Huk&rdquo; (The Huk) paints a triumphalist picture of the Hukbalahap, an army organized during World War II against the Japanese, while &ldquo;Ang CLO&rdquo; (The CLO) recounts the formation of the Congress of Labor Unions. Among the many prominent personalities featured in the section are Mariano Balgos, Guillermo Capadocia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5372\">Amado Hernandez</a>, and Alfredo Saulo. &ldquo;Ang Bagong Partido&rdquo; (The New Party) presents the establishment of a new Communist party as a reaction to what he claims was a monopoly of power by the Lava-Taruc leadership in the old one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book&rsquo;s significance lies as much in its appropriation of the memoir form as in the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of its content. The memoir is used here to archive the historic struggles of the peasant movement and inspire more people to join the revolutionaries, instead of immortalizing the private life of a privileged few, as in many contemporary examples. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Arbeen Acu&ntilde;a</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5787\">Criselda Yabes</a>. Quezon City: University of the Philippines (UP) Press, 2010. Gawad Likhaan: The UP Centennial Literary Prize for creative nonfiction, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book is an account of the twilight years of the sultanate of Sulu, and the contentious coronation of its last sultan. Sarena, the eponymous narrator, is servant to Princess Piandao, who refuses to bow down to the datus in her bid to become sultana. Many decades later, Sarena gives her memoirs to her estranged daughter Taj in the hope that these will bring her back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This memoir-within-a-memoir is a series of fragments that nevertheless form a causal and linear narrative. The metafictional technique is evident in the frame narrative of a mother and daughter&rsquo;s reconciliation, and in short asides in the memoir where Sarena addresses Taj to talk about a shared memory or an unsolved issue in their relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Sarena&rsquo;s Story</i></b>, the oft-marginalized in Philippine society are brought to the forefront.

Notwithstanding Alejo&rsquo;s claim in his introduction that all but one of the literary works in this anthology were written in the various indigenous languages of Mindanao, all but two of the works published here are actually in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, Filipino, and English, the region&rsquo;s three politically dominant languages. The two exceptions are in Manobo, although Alejo states that the one exception is in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The two Manobo pieces are themselves exemplary proof of the continuation of the <i>lumad</i> (indigenous people) poetic tradition. &ldquo;Tonggapow Kos Kod Ginawa Ku&rdquo; (Accept My Love) is structured as a dialogue between a garden of flowers (<i>kabulaklakan</i>) and a visitor seeking the truth that the garden bears. Images and metaphors derive from Manobo practices and beliefs, such as honey gathering, fruit picking, the manner in which a guest is welcomed into one&rsquo;s house, and the belief that nature is gracious if a visitor is of pure heart and intent. The other Manobo piece, &ldquo;Kanduli tu Bai Ratu&rdquo; (<strong><strong>Ritual</strong></strong> Prayer to Bai Ratu), is a plea to the supreme deity, Megbevaya, and to the lesser spirit, Bai Ratu, to protect the crops from harm. As such, it serves as a fitting end to the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are poems affirming the lumad&rsquo;s self-identity: the dignity of one&rsquo;s humble stature in &ldquo;Sayote&rdquo; (Chayote); the identification with the sea and marine life in &ldquo;Tribung Sama&rdquo; (Sama Tribe); and a self-description as being brave, fierce, and noble in &ldquo;Obo Manobo Ako&rdquo; (I Am Obo Manobo). On the other hand, &ldquo;Ako ug ang Akong Kalibotan&rdquo; (I and the World) compares the lowly self to various weak and powerless objects; and &ldquo;Naglagot nga Uk-ok&rdquo; (The Angry Cockroach) concludes that it is greed for money and power that has caused tribal disunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In several poems, the violation of nature and her resources, particularly those of Mount Apo Sandawa, is the metaphor for the violation of the lumad. The educational system is held responsible for the erasure of indigenous names and for the lure of the city. The violation on the lumad poetic tradition itself is inadvertently shown by the inclusion of two colonial Tagalog forms in the anthology: a <b>tanaga</b> (four-line, seven-syllable poem) and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\"><b>balagtasan</b></a> (poetic joust). Without the Manobo original, the tanaga &ldquo;Buhangin&rdquo; (Sand) is de-contextualized and hence conveys a universal, rather than the lumad, experience. A balagtasan, &ldquo;Hintawa tu Mapuslanon, Kauswagan o Kaguyanganan?&rdquo; (Who Is More Useful, Progress or Nature?), ends ambivalently, in compliance with the genre&rsquo;s conventions, thus shirking a resolution to Mindanao&rsquo;s troubled history. In contrast, the poem &ldquo;Unsaon Pagtuki?&rdquo; (How to Analyze?) opens with the lumad belief that every person is born with twin souls, and then proceeds to enumerate a series of conundrums that are metaphors of lumad life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The section &ldquo;Alamat&rdquo; (Legend) includes accounts of the origin of place names, land formations, disabled persons, and the strange behavior of animals. &ldquo;Ang Kabog&rdquo; (The Bat) condemns individualistic behavior, and &ldquo;Sinugdanan sa Unggoy&rdquo; (The Origin of the Monkey) condemns the mistreatment of animals. Trickster tales show the lowly and the lazy turning the tables on the privileged and powerful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The section &ldquo;Ritwal&rdquo; (Ritual) consists of an enumeration of Manobo deities; a description of an Umayamnon wedding; an explication of the Sama <i>pag-mbo</i>,&rsquo; which is an Islamic practice with pre-Islamic origins; a ceremonial cockfight held by the Arumanon-Manobo to foretell their fortune in the coming year; a shaman&rsquo;s healing rituals; farming rituals, which include dream interpretations (a snake means a bountiful harvest; a carabao or fire means a bad harvest); a Pulangion-Manobo wedding; and the most sacred of all rituals, the <i>D&rsquo;yandi</i> (peace pact).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Ilog Pulangi&rdquo; (Pulangi River), in the section &ldquo;Kasaysayan&rdquo; (History), describes the eponymous river as traversing Mindanao from west to east. It enables two brothers, from whom the lumad and the Muslims are descended, to continue exchanging goods with one another though forced to live apart. &ldquo;Pakigbisog sa mga <i>Manigaon</i>&rdquo; (The Struggle of the Chieftains) is a powerful personalized account of the forced migrations of a clan, dating from Spanish colonization to present-day logging concessions; the consequent transfer of Manobo land to outsiders; and the dogged resistance waged by the clan patriarchs through the generations. It may well serve as a historical framework for the anthology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the unfortunate editorial interventions, the literary pieces here are a valuable contribution to contemporary Philippine literature. Indigenous literature is often erroneously assumed to date back to ancient, precolonial times. However, at the time of publication, the authors ranged in age from the early 20s to the 40s, with one in his late 60s. All of them seek to present their own perspectives on their person and place as lumad, instead of having outsiders, such as anthropologists and cultural workers, speak for them. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\">Rosario Cruz-Lucero</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5200\"> </a></em></p>\r\n",

Without the Manobo original, the tanaga &#x201C;Buhangin&#x201D; (Sand) is de-contextualized and hence conveys a universal, rather than the lumad, experience. A balagtasan, &#x201C;Hintawa tu Mapuslanon, Kauswagan o Kaguyanganan?&#x201D; (Who Is More Useful, Progress or Nature?), ends ambivalently, in compliance with the genre&#x2019;s conventions, thus shirking a resolution to Mindanao&#x2019;s troubled history. In contrast, the poem &#x201C;Unsaon Pagtuki?&#x201D; (How to Analyze?) opens with the lumad belief that every person is born with twin souls, and then proceeds to enumerate a series of conundrums that are metaphors of lumad life."

It may well serve as a historical framework for the anthology."

Author, Epifanio San Juan Jr. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"WorksBodyTextnotab\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Commenting on selected works by Nick Joaquin, Epifanio San Juan Jr shows the contradictions in the relationship between literature and the postcolonial situation in developing countries such as the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In his preface, San Juan explains that critics have active roles in social transformation. They should &ldquo;let the text speak the emancipatory message&rdquo; and show the opposition of the text to orthodox readings &ldquo;that have exploited Joaquin to maintain and legitimize class rule.&rdquo; San Juan draws from the theories of Antonio Gramsci and Georg Lukacs, which have helped to forge a socialist cultural politics in the Third World, and the ideas of Friedrich Nietzsche, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, and the French psychoanalytic school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the first and seventh chapters, San Juan analyzes how the Virgin in &ldquo;La Naval de Manila&rdquo; (The Manila Navy), <b><i>Caves</i></b><i> <b>and</b> <b>Shadows</b></i>, 1983,<i> </i>and other works represent the utopian and the unconscious. He presents the contradiction in capitalism amid the uneven economic development of the Philippines and in the chronicling of Philippine history according to colonial victories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the second chapter, San Juan promotes the need to doubt orthodox interpretations of Joaquin&rsquo;s works. He maintains that Joaquin&rsquo;s short stories can be used for the radical transformation of Philippine society. &ldquo;Three Generations,&rdquo; for example, is usually read as the intermingling of Christian and indigenous values, of the sacred and the profane, of reason and desire.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido L. Lumbera</a>. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press. Reprinted, 2001. Partially published in <b><i>Philippine</i></b><i> <b>Studies</b> </i>in 1968 and <b><i>Asia-Philippines Leader</i></b> in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prior to Lumbera&rsquo;s work, there existed a number of studies on the development of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> poetry, but for sheer scope and magnitude, <b><i>Tagalog</i></b><i> <b><strong>Poetry</strong></b> </i>is undoubtedly a pioneering critical text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The study examines the different influences that have shaped the development of Tagalog poetry by reconstructing the early history of the genre, from the 17th until the 19th century. The approach chosen&mdash;a diachronic perspective&mdash;necessitates a definite historical sense, which is what determines the structure of the study. Chapter 1 focuses on the early forms of Tagalog poetry&mdash;the riddle, the proverb, and the short poems&mdash;and the manner in which these forms could have constituted the folk tradition. Chapter 2 discusses the evolution from oral to written poetry and covers works of the missionary poets, the <b>ladino</b> (bilingual poets), and the Tagalog poets. Chapter 3 shows the assimilation and synthesis of the two dominant traditions&mdash;the folk and the missionary influences, as exemplified in the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5056\">Gaspar Aquino de Belen</a> and Felipe de Jesus, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lumbera contends that the crystallization of tradition took place in the works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>, aka Balagtas&mdash;specifically, his <em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\">Florante at Laura </a></strong></em>(Florante and Laura), ca 1838-61. The text is both a positive response to earlier aspects of the folk tradition and an appropriation of some elements of the tradition introduced by the Spanish missionaries. More importantly, Balagtas and his texts would become the source of a number of major influences in the future. Among these are the accordance of prestige on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> as a medium of serious ideas; the canonization of the courtly love tradition; the emphasis on the emotions; the use of rhetorical devices that run counter to the more spontaneous use of familiar images in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1552\">folk poetry</a>; and the prevalence of the aphoristic style, which identifies the poet with the sage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The final chapter deals with the poetry produced during the revolutionary years and the uses these forms were put to. Lumbera argues that although they are not great poetry, the poems of the propagandists and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a> helped create a nation. The appendix contains the English translations of selected poems produced within the last three centuries and thus makes accessible some of the most illustrative poems from the Spanish period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lumbera&rsquo;s study spawned much controversy and led to a vigorous debate regarding the meaning of tradition and the correctness of Lumbera&rsquo;s formalistic interpretation of <b><i>Florante</i></b><i> <b>at</b> <b>Laura</b></i>,<i> </i>which in its history had always been approached from the moral and allegorical perspective. Significant critical reactions were made by Epifanio SanJuan Jr and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5385\">Lucila Hosillos</a> on Lumbera&rsquo;s interpretation of <b><i>Florante</i></b><i> <b>at</b> <b>Laura</b></i>,<i> </i>and by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5493\">E. Arsenio Manuel</a> on Lumbera&rsquo;s discussion of folkpoetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Tagalog</i></b><i> <b>Poetry</b> </i>is significant for being the first sustained examination of the different elements that constituted a tradition crystallized in Balagtas and which eventually influenced a host of later writers. Moreover, it reevaluates traditional views on Tagalog poetry. Thus, Lumbera succeeds in problematizing basic issues concerned with Tagalog poetry, literary criticism, and literary history in the 1960s. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The approach chosen&#x2014;a diachronic perspective&#x2014;necessitates a definite historical sense, which is what determines the structure of the study. Chapter 1 focuses on the early forms of Tagalog poetry&#x2014;the riddle, the proverb, and the short poems&#x2014;and the manner in which these forms could have constituted the folk tradition. Chapter 2 discusses the evolution from oral to written poetry and covers works of the missionary poets, the <b>ladino</b> (bilingual poets), and the Tagalog poets. Chapter 3 shows the assimilation and synthesis of the two dominant traditions&#x2014;the folk and the missionary influences, as exemplified in the works of <a href=\"/9/9/5056\">Gaspar Aquino de Belen</a> and Felipe de Jesus, among others."

The text is both a positive response to earlier aspects of the folk tradition and an appropriation of some elements of the tradition introduced by the Spanish missionaries. More importantly, Balagtas and his texts would become the source of a number of major influences in the future. Among these are the accordance of prestige on <a href=\"/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> as a medium of serious ideas; the canonization of the courtly love tradition; the emphasis on the emotions; the use of rhetorical devices that run counter to the more spontaneous use of familiar images in <a href=\"/9/73/1552\">folk poetry</a>; and the prevalence of the aphoristic style, which identifies the poet with the sage."

Manila: Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An anthology of poems and essays written in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> or in Tagalog translation from Chinese, the book was published in celebration of the 10th anniversary of Kaisa Para Sa Kaunlaran, a Chinese Filipino organization. Most of the works had been previously published in <b><i><strong>Tulay</strong></i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The essays in this anthology portray the Chinese Filipino experience as a constant struggle for acceptance by a society whose &ldquo;narrow nationalism&rdquo; subjects other ethnicities to being perennial outsiders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Joaquin Sy&rsquo;s essays &ldquo;Nationalismo, Uso Pa Ba?&rdquo; (Nationalism, Is It Still Trendy?), &ldquo;Sanlibo&rsquo;t Isang Dahilan&rdquo; (A Thousand and One Reasons), &ldquo;Sintomas ng Panahong Darating?&rdquo; (Signs of Things to Come?), and &ldquo;Tigre Na Tayo?&rdquo; (Are We Now Tigers?) examine the Chinese Filipinos&rsquo; thwarted attempts at integration with the rest of Philippine society and the various experiences of discrimination that they routinely face. In &ldquo;Ayyy &hellip; Nasyonalismo&rdquo; (Ayyy &hellip; Nationalism), Sy emphasizes the need for Chinese Filipinos to assert their cultural identity as a way of securing their place in Philippine society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Go Bon Juan&rsquo;s essays &ldquo;Sapagkat Siya&rsquo;y Mahal Pa Rin Natin&rdquo; (Because We Still Love Her), &ldquo;Sapagkat Ito&rsquo;y Karapatan Natin&rdquo; (Because It&rsquo;s Our Right), and &ldquo;Mahigpit na Pagkakaugnay&rdquo; (A Tight Connection) also view the Chinese Filipino&rsquo;s dual cultural heritage in a positive light, claiming that a Chinese born and raised in the Philippines can be as nationalistic as a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; Filipino. The author also sheds light on the pervasive stereotypes about Chinese Filipinos while highlighting the historically close ties between the two groups, including their shared experience of oppression under Spanish rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The poems likewise foreground questions of nationalism and ethnicity. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5526\">James Na</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Niyebe&rdquo; (Snow) and &ldquo;Kalesa&rdquo; (Horse-Drawn Carriage) are reflections on the search for one&rsquo;s roots.

Manila: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book consists of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5616\">Vicente Rama</a>&rsquo;s memoir and selected short works of literature and journalism, translated by Villanueva, with the original <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> pieces presented as the book&rsquo;s second section. In the book&rsquo;s introduction, Mojares states that Cebuanos remember Rama primarily for being the author of the charter that established Cebu as a city but that Rama&rsquo;s pioneering role in promoting Cebuano literature and journalism is equally important. The book aims to introduce Rama as a writer and patron of Cebuano writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first chapter, &ldquo;Portrait of a Father,&rdquo; gives us Rama&rsquo;s biography, based on the recollections of former mayor of Cebu and Rama&rsquo;s close friend, Eulogio Borres. The second chapter, &ldquo;Memories of a Life&rdquo; / &ldquo;Mga Handumanan sa Akong Kinabuhi,&rdquo; is Rama&rsquo;s memoir. It narrates Cebu&rsquo;s role in the Philippine Revolution against Spain, his publishing and political career, and his life during World War II. One subchapter recounts Rama&rsquo;s major contribution to Cebuano letters: the creation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5077\"><b><i>Bag-ong Kusog</i></b></a>, a Cebuano-language periodical that published journalism and literary works in 1915-41.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book&rsquo;s last chapter &ldquo;Selected Short Works&rdquo; / &ldquo;Mga Pinili nga Sinulat&rdquo; features Rama&rsquo;s selected journalistic pieces, essays, a short story, and two novel chapters. &ldquo;The Man-Eaters of Mindanao&rdquo; / &ldquo;Adunay Kahoy sa Mindanaw nga Mokaon ug Tawo?&rdquo; shows the satirical approach Rama favored in most of his writing. The piece narrates an account of flesh-eating trees of Mindanao, one of many misconceptions that dissuaded workers from settling on the island. Rama refutes the hearsay using scientific facts and irony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Advance Payment&rdquo; / &ldquo;Ang Bugay&rdquo; is a short story about Koring and Kolas, former lovers trying to patch things up even though Koring has already agreed to marry another man. A simple tale about a doomed love affair, the story is told in a shifting third-person point of view, with a narrator openly addressing the reader. &ldquo;Love, Then and Now&rdquo; / &ldquo;Gugma Kanhi ug Karon&rdquo; is an essay in which Rama compares romantic relationships in his period and those in the past. Another nostalgia piece is &ldquo;The Hard Lot of Manding Kuwaresma&rdquo; / &ldquo;Ang mga Mahay ni Manding Kuwaresma,&rdquo; a piece about how the observance of Lent has lost its solemnity over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Artemio Aranas&rdquo; is an example of Rama&rsquo;s inventive reportage. Written like narrative fiction, with some parts told in scenes, the piece combines humor and sociology in describing the quarrel between a local paper and the Health Bureau over the cause of a cholera outbreak in an unnamed town in Cebu. In the piece&rsquo;s climactic scene, a boy named Artemio Aranas delivers a speech that exposes the incompetence of so-called journalists who have misinformed the residents about the threat of disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first two chapters of Rama&rsquo;s novel <b><i>Ang Silot ni Bathala</i></b> (Retribution), 1948, introduce Petra, a married woman having an affair with a married man. &ldquo;Karnabal&rdquo; (Carnival) opens with a rowdy street fair attended by locals and foreigners. &ldquo;Mga Takuban ug Anino&rdquo; (Masks and Shadows) shows Petra among those participating in the carnival. Petra takes the occasion to shed her inhibitions, an attempt to escape the confines of a society that will ultimately punish her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;The Sto. Ni&ntilde;o of Cebu&rdquo; / &ldquo;Ang Santo Ninyo sa Sugbu,&rdquo; Rama provides an account of the origin of Cebu&rsquo;s patron. After the Spaniards, led by Gen Miguel Lopez de Legaspi, have driven King Tupas and his villagers into the mountains, they burn a local settlement by the sea. Later, a Spanish soldier named Juan de Camus finds an image of the Sto. Ni&ntilde;o among the ruins.

Kwan Laurel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Amah&rdquo; is about a grandfather and Amah, his partner in a successful dumpling business. When Amah falls terminally ill, the grandfather seeks out all possible cures for her except Western medicine, despite his family&rsquo;s suggestions.

The father&rsquo;s marriage, memories of his children, making and stealing salt during hard times in China are told in a nostalgic tone. Hau&rsquo;s &ldquo;The True Story of Ah To&rdquo; tells of the narrator&rsquo;s communist father who leaves China to escape the war.

The myth of the wealthy Chinese being the cause of these abductions, Dy contradicts this myth by presenting the Chinese Filipino as a member of the working class struggling to make ends meet. On the other hand, in another essay, &ldquo;Face to Face with Rural Living,&rdquo; Dy celebrates the undaunted spirit of the Filipino people and her shared heritage with them as she witnesses village people in La Union rebuilding their lives in the wake of a tragedy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Doreen Yu&rsquo;s &ldquo;Singkit Nga Naman&rdquo; (Oh, the Slant Eyed) and Audrey Lim Tan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang Tsinoy Ay Pinoy Rin!&rdquo; (The Chinese Filipino Is Filipino Too!) tell of the disadvantages of one&#39;s having slanted eyes in the Philippines. Chinese Filipinos must endure the fear of being kidnapped for ransom and being taunted for being &ldquo;singkit.&rdquo; Yu and Tan argue that Chinese Filipinos, being a minority group, naturally want to belong, but they must constantly prove themselves more Filipino than the average Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Joaquin Sy&rsquo;s poem, &ldquo;Dalawang Maikling Kuwento tungkol sa Kung Bakit Magulo sa Bayan ni Pedro&rdquo; (Two Short Stories about Why Pedro&rsquo;s Country Is in Chaos), observes the Filipinos&rsquo; lack of discipline and driving etiquette of Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other fictionists and essayists in this collection are Grace Pe-Bacani, Krysty Choi, Augusto Dy, Nancy Lao Bi-Eng, Anson Sia Dichaves, Si Diu Eng, Fannie Tan Koa, Jacqueline Co, Anita Lo, Carmelea Ang See, Melchor C.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5517\">Resil Mojares</a>. With a preface by the author. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book is a collection of 12 critical essays covering aspects of Philippine cultural history. The title essay discusses the importance of using folklore as an indicator of a people&rsquo;s way of seeing the world. As a demonstration, Mojares uses the folk legend &ldquo;Mariang Makiling.&rdquo; He finds embedded in it precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial imaginings. He also shows how the Mariang Makiling legend has been appropriated for both conservative and liberative purposes as historical moments allow or induce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several essays dwell on history writing itself. &ldquo;The Islands according to Pigafetta&rdquo; investigates the Philippine section of the book <b><i>First Voyage around the World</i></b>, one of the earliest accounts about the Philippines. Mojares sees Pigafetta as writing in the mode of the European chivalric romance, thereby domesticating the new world in the image of the old. &ldquo;The Brief and Blessed Life of Miguel Ayatumo&rdquo; analyzes the biography of a 16-year-old Christian convert appended to a conduct book. Through the strategies of reduction and figuration, the life of the native is made to fit and offered as an image of the model Christian. &ldquo;Time, Memory, and the Birth of the Nation&rdquo; surveys the representations of the 1896 Philippine Revolution in biographies and memoirs written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>, Emilio Aguinaldo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5416\">Teodoro M. Kalaw</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5557\">Rafael Palma</a> among others. Mojares shows how memories of the revolution eventually figure in and produce official histories of the nation. &ldquo;The Epiphany of Pedro Calungsod&rdquo; narrates how the local church in a bid for his canonization represented the life of Calungsod. In recounting the process of canonization of another Filipino, Lorenzo Ruiz, during the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, Mojares shows the confluence of motives of the pope and the state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In these essays, Mojares demonstrates that histories produce as much as discover the objects that they inquire into. They are products of historical moments and political contingencies. As such, historical representations are subject to distortions, deletions, and contestation, and to the tropes of the modes in which they are written. The mode of sacred history, for example, in which the lives of Miguel Ayatumo and Calungsod are framed, give up specificities in favor of Christian types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The problem of colonial subjects representing themselves is taken up in &ldquo;Rizal Reading Pigafetta.&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a> illustrates the predicament of the colonial subject writing against European texts by using&mdash;and sometimes misusing&mdash;European texts, whether historical, scientific, or anthropological. For example, through the methods of comparative linguistics which he had learned from German thinkers, Rizal made a case for the Philippines&rsquo; being an ancient and advanced civilization before the coming of Spain. The &ldquo;defects&rdquo; of the natives, such as indolence, were the product of Spanish colonialism. Rizal thus uses discourses of racial superiority which Spain had used to justify its colonization of the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other essays in the collection are &ldquo;Stalking the Virgin,&rdquo; which shows the hybridity in the cult of the Virgin of Guadalupe in Cebu; &ldquo;Catechisms of the Body,&rdquo; which sketches the colonial Church&rsquo;s attempts to regulate native bodies along Christian lines through conduct books; &ldquo;Deciphering a Meal,&rdquo; which teases out the politics embedded in two banquets in Cebu during the Spanish and American colonial periods; &ldquo;Reading <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5622\">Vicente Ranudo</a>,&rdquo; which gleans <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> concepts of poetry from an examination of Ranudo&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Pag-usara&rdquo; (Solitude); &ldquo;Talking Politics,&rdquo; which reveals the importance and limits of radio <i>komentaryo </i>(commentary),<i> </i>a genre of Cebuano political discourse that rose to prominence after the lifting of martial law in 1981; and &ldquo;The Haunting of the Filipino Writer,&rdquo; which suggests that it is the psychic lack, or the sense of having lost the soul, caused by colonialism that drives Filipino writers to write.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Waiting for Mariang Makiling</i></b> fleshes out cultural and historical signs, symbols, and texts that seem innocent but which need to be reevaluated and deconstructed.

Among them were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5500\">Paz Marquez-Benitez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5469\">Maria Luna-Lopez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5686\">Bienvenido Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5336\">Angela Manalang-Gloria</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5664\">Arturo Rotor</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5568\">Loreto Paras-Sulit</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5462\">Salvador Lopez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5788\">Leopoldo Y.

The book shows that their favorite models were O. Henry, Guy de Maupassant, and Edgar Allan Poe. Heroes were Pollyanna, Hiawatha, and Horatio Alger. Vocabulary was a &ldquo;plaything&rdquo; and they were &ldquo;drunk with words.&rdquo; Here, too, popular legends about these writers are either finally confirmed or corrected.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">All of the writers interviewed, except Villa, give credit to Paz Marquez-Benitez for inspiring them with her kindness and her bag of &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; to make them productive. It was an era of constant literary activity; there were writers&rsquo; clubs, editorial jobs, meetings at the Sulit store and the Arguilla basement. Lopez and Yabes are notable for their understanding of Philippine literature in English as well as its relations with society and the local traditions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The second book focuses on 19 writers of the &ldquo;second generation,&rdquo; who began writing around the mid-1930s and into World War II. These writers include Armando Malay, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3488\">E.

What marks them as the second generation is not merely chronology but more the influence, whether negative or positive, on them of the &ldquo;first generation.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The American writers whom they emulated were Erskine Caldwell, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Thomas Wolfe; but they were also influenced by British writers and poets. A number, such as the Tiempos, Demetillo, Ilio, Arcellana, and Gonzalez, were trained under American writers and critics and brought home with them the tenets of New Criticism. It was this school of criticism that dominated both Philippine writing in English and literary criticism, through creative writing workshops at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman</a> and the University of the Philippines.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Like the first, this second book settles manifold questions of literary history.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido L. Lumbera</a>. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Composed of 61 reviews, conference papers, lectures, critical essays, and articles of varying length, the collection offers a spectrum of the issues around culture and nationalism. In this collection, the reader sees how Lumbera&rsquo;s consciousness has been shaped by his own encounter with interlocking historical processes from the 1980s, the assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr being a crucial event, until the 1990s. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The book is divided into five sections. The first section, &ldquo;Culture and Politics/Kultura at Politika,&rdquo; provides the major perspective through which the rest of the essays could be viewed. The deep historical consciousness informs Lumbera&rsquo;s discussion of the meaning of nationalist culture, the sources of tradition which continue to shape contemporary texts, the far-reaching and generally negative impact of American colonialism, and writing by Filipinos about the &ldquo;land of milk and honey.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Running through these essays in the first section is the full awareness that texts must be approached as the dynamic product of a complex series of sociopolitical processes that defined a specific historical period. Of special interest are the essays &ldquo;After the Yellow Year: The Literary Scene since 21 August 1983,&rdquo; where texts were contextualized against the fateful event of Aquino&rsquo;s assassination, and &ldquo;Ambushing the New Enemy: Artists and the Revolution of 1898,&rdquo; where Lumbera shows various Filipino artists actively responding to the series of events precipitated by the Revolution of 1898.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The second section, &ldquo;Language and Culture / Wika at Kultura,&rdquo; pursues the thorny and polarizing issue of language where Filipino has remained the &ldquo;other&rdquo; of English. He also shows how <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> has resisted this imprisonment in various texts. In &ldquo;Ang Pagpasok sa Lumang Kultura&rdquo; (Upon Entering Old Culture), Lumbera shows how through the language, powerful symbols woven into the fabric of Tagalog texts could be made to resonate with the people&rsquo;s deepest aspirations to be free. Of further interest, especially in light of the renewed interest in translation is &ldquo;Pagsasalin tungo sa Panahong Tapos na ang Pagkabilanggo sa Wikang Ingles&rdquo; (Translation toward Liberation from English). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Lumbera then focuses on the area where he first achieved critical acclaim in the 1970s as a pioneering critic of Tagalog poetry during the Spanish period. In the section &ldquo;Literature/Panitikan,&rdquo; the essay &ldquo;Harnessing Regional Literature for National Literature&rdquo; lays down the premises </span>of a continuing debate on the distinction between &ldquo;regional&rdquo; <span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">and &ldquo;national&rdquo; literature. Lumbera writes that the hierarchy is rooted in colonial institutions, such as the American-style public school system, that privileged the colonial tongue. However, he ends with a contentious assertion that the categories &ldquo;regional&rdquo; and &ldquo;national&rdquo; should &ldquo;be kept separate,&rdquo; with the former depicting &ldquo;specificities of life experienced and viewed with a narrower framework&rdquo; and the latter &ldquo;expressing larger concerns and broader perspectives.&rdquo; A number of scholars and writers from outside Manila have since engaged this point of view.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The other issues in the literature section include the need to frame evaluative criticism against norms, traditional and modern; the continuing relevance of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5372\">Amado V. Hernandez</a> and the tradition of protest that his writing exemplifies; the production of texts, both primary and secondary, after EDSA, 1986-95, and the major issues involved; and the context of Philippine literature as a country in Southeast Asia.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In the fourth section, &ldquo;Theatre/Teatro,&rdquo; Lumbera discusses a genre he helped nurture with his own creative works as a playwright. He eulogizes a great artist in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Ka Atang</a>: Honorata de la Rama, Artista ng Bayan&rdquo; (Ka Atang: Honorata de la Rama, National Artist) and pays tribute to his friend and colleague <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a> in &ldquo;Rolando S. Tinio: Artist of All Arts.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">As in the other essays, Lumbera valorizes theatrical productions where burning issues, such as patriotism and betrayal, exploitation and capital greed, among others, occupy center stage, and in the process, problematize taken-for-granted realities that the elite have successfully manufactured. Such reviews as &ldquo;&lsquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/landingPage/9/76\">Pagsalunga&rsquo;</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5696\">Sikat</a>: Poignant Insights, Moving Performances&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Trial / Ang Paglilitis: Putting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5124\">Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s Enemies on Trial&rdquo; eloquently reaffirm the duty of a critic committed to expose what lies beneath the surface.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The final section, &ldquo;Film/Pelikula,&rdquo; includes essays on the history of film, the stages in its evolution from entertainment to serious portraits of society, and the roles it must play in a fractious and violent society. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">In a way a summation of Lumbera&rsquo;s career as critic, <b><i>Writing the Nation / Pag-akda ng Bansa</i></b><i> </i>reveals a critical voice that remains uncompromising and relentless in its systematic exposition and critique of texts from different genres. To read Lumbera&rsquo;s essays is to open the reader&rsquo;s </span>mind to the complex working of a powerful intellect, always probing beneath the surface of whatever text needed to be analyzed and evaluated. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong> Written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5645\"> Reyes</a></strong> </em></p>\r\n",
