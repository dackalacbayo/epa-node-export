Cebu City: University of San Carlos Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the introduction Klassen situates the study in the context of what he theorizes Philippine architecture might be: &ldquo;This study aims to contribute to the development of genuine Filipino architecture which sincerely and truthfully shows the dreams and principles of individual Filipinos and of the country.&rdquo; Klassen adds that in the attempt to arrive at an architecture which is genuinely Filipino, the architect should endeavor to create a good piece of architecture, keeping in mind the physical and cultural conditions of the Philippines. If there is&nbsp;<em>Philippine-ness&nbsp;</em>in his work, it is arrived at incidentally and often unconsciously, depending on the designer&rsquo;s cultural background and inventiveness. Moreover, Klassen believes that a sense of national identity is to be developed not in isolation but in interaction with history and the cultures of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it does not intend to be a history of Philippine architecture, the book describes the structures found or built in the Philippines in diachronic fashion, from the precolonial to the contemporary periods. The book is divided into six chapters. Chapter 1, &ldquo;How it All Began: Primitive Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; discusses in passing the earliest habitation site in the country&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/386\">Tabon Cave Complex</a> in Quezon, Palawan. Klassen also discusses the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/241\">rice terraces</a> of northern Luzon and its hydraulic technology, and how it inspired architects such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>, who designed the then new Manila International Airport building as an inverted terrace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2, &ldquo;The Bahay Kubo: Vernacular Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; deals with traditional architecture, which adjusts an existing model depending on a specific need. He describes the many variations of traditional houses in northern Philippines and the beliefs associated with them, and then the different examples of Visayan and Muslim vernacular architecture, and ends with a discussion of vernacular architecture as art and as expressions of the Filipino soul in the field of architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3, &ldquo;Three Hundred Years Under Spain: Spanish Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; first examines the arrival of the Spaniards in the 16th century and the temporary buildings they built in Cebu such as a chapel and friary. It then moves to the settlements in Manila, describing the process of <strong>reduccion</strong> (controlled settlement) and the early churches of Manila and its environs, like the oldest stone church in the country, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin church</a>, and those of the Augustinians, Franciscans, Jesuits, Dominicans, and the Augustinian Recollects in different parts of the country. He also discusses Spanish colonial architecture in Cebu City and the preservation of these <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">heritage buildings</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The whole of Chapter 4, &ldquo;Six Hundred Years of Islam: Muslim Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; is devoted to structures built by groups which have been Islamized, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanaon</a>. It discusses the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\"><strong>kota</strong></a> or fortifications as well as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/234\"><strong>masjid</strong></a> or mosques, the <strong>madrasah</strong> or schools, and the traditional <strong>torogan</strong> or large house of the datu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5, &ldquo;Fifty Years with Uncle Sam: The American Period,&rdquo; talks about planner and architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel Burnham</a>, who is famous for designing the cityscape of Manila and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a>. It also delves into the lives and works of equally prominent architects then, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William Parsons</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 6, &ldquo;A Nation At Last: Contemporary Architecture in the Philippines,&rdquo; deals with the early postwar architects and their works such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, and those architects that became prominent after World War II such as Antonio, Nakpil, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>. It also describes the works of Leandro V. Locsin and looks into contemporary architects who made a mark in the architectural scene like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2660\">Gabriel Formoso</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2672\">Alfredo Luz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2708\">Jose Ma.

The book ends with a short discussion on the contemporary architecture of Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book features more than 180 sketches and colored photographs which are expanded to more than 350 in its second edition.

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arkitekturang Filipino</em></strong> recounts the history of architecture in the Philippines from the early <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">settlements</a> to the postmodern era, using the perspective and criteria of Filipino architecture or architecture which is the result of the Filipino&rsquo;s interaction with the environment and the many and diverse cross-cultural influences that came into the country over the centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The well-researched and well-illustrated book uses a multidisciplinary approach to the subject, drawing not only from urban history and architectural history but also fields such as sociology, economic history, anthropology, and even literary theory, all of which Lico says offer new perspectives on the subject and reveal the factors that influenced local architecture in terms of style, technology, planning theory, and conceptual imagery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is divided into eight chapters. In Chapter 1, &ldquo;Between the Earth and Sky: Early Philippine Settlers,&rdquo; Lico talks about the early human settlements in the Philippines and habitats such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/233\">caves</a> and trees.

Spain: Escuela de Estudios Hispano-Americanos de Sevilla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Noted Spanish scholar Maria Lourdes Diaz-Trechuelo (1921-2008) built a name for herself among Filipino scholars and Filipinists for her work on Spanish colonial architecture, art, and history in the Philippines. For her doctoral dissertation defended at the Universidad de Madrid in 1955, she wrote about colonial architecture in the Philippines. This was based on documents in Spanish archives and without benefit of fieldwork in the Philippines. In 1956, she published &ldquo;Manila: Notas Sobre su Evolucion Urbana&rdquo; (Manila: Notes on Urban Development) which won the Luis Vives award of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC). Although she lectured, wrote, and published other works on Philippine topics, such as engraving, cartography, 18th-century economy, and the del Cuellar botanical expedition, it was the publication of her 1955 thesis that would be her seminal work, <strong><em>Arquitectura Espa&ntilde;ola en Filipinas (1565-1800)</em></strong> that had a lasting and profound impact on colonial architecture studies in the Philippines. That book linked her and Philippine scholars, eventually bringing her to the Philippines in 1977 to see first-hand the buildings and structures she wrote about in the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Digging into Spanish archives which are filled with documents sent by friars and government functionaries to the Consejo de las Indias, Diaz-Trechuelo faced a mountain of information. This she systematized and presented in 13 chapters to which she appended 188 plates with the corresponding legends. <strong><em>Arquitectura&hellip;</em></strong> is a treasure trove of information not readily accessible to Philippine scholars unable to visit Seville&rsquo;s and Madrid&rsquo;s archives. Just the plates alone without the text constitute a valuable source of primary documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 13 chapters of <strong><em>Arquitectura&hellip;</em></strong> are: 1) &ldquo;Urban Development of Manila from its Foundation until the End of the 18th Century&rdquo;; 2) &ldquo;Military Architecture: Fortification of the City until 1700&rdquo;; 3) &ldquo;Military Engineers in the Philippines&rdquo;; 4) &ldquo;The Fortification of Manila Until 1762 and the New Project&rdquo;; 5) &ldquo;Military Architecture: The Execution of the Project&rdquo;; 6) &ldquo;Military and Civil Architecture&rdquo;; 7) &ldquo;Religious Architecture: The Manila Cathedral&rdquo;; 8). &ldquo;Religious Architecture: Sixteenth Century Foundations&rdquo;; 9) &ldquo;Religious Architecture: Seventeenth and Eighteenth Century Foundations&rdquo;; 10) &ldquo;The Port of Cavite in the Seventeenth Century&rdquo;; 11) &ldquo;The Fortification of Cavite in the Eighteenth Century: The City and its Buildings&rdquo;; 12) &ldquo;The Episcopal Cities of Cebu, Nueva C&aacute;ceres, and Nueva Segovia&rdquo;; and 13) &ldquo;The Fortifications of Mindanao, Calamianes, and the Visayas&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During her long academic career, Diaz-Trechuelo mentored many students and even those in the Philippines who had not met her were alerted to the value of colonial documents in Philippine archives. The succeeding generation of scholars after the pioneers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel de Ayala</a>, Richard Ahlborn, and Benito Legarda would use archival material more extensively to paint a more nuanced and richer picture of colonial architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Arquitectura&hellip;</em></strong> had many practical uses.

Quezon City: University of the Philippines (UP) Office of Research Coordination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Art in the Philippines</em></strong> is the work of Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda (1904-67), artist and former dean of the UP College of Fine Arts (CFA) in 1956-61. It is a pioneering work that gives a comprehensive history of Philippine architecture, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>. It has 147 pages of text and 199 pages of illustrations, of which six are in color. The illustrations, although badly reproduced because of the limits of printing technology then, are an integral part of the book and arguably its more important contribution. It reproduces some vintage images like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> in ruins after World War II, Rizal Theater in Makati, now demolished, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/356\">Pardo Church</a> in Cebu without the &ldquo;Eye of God&rdquo; motif on its rose windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The text is a pioneering work devoted to architecture, painting, and sculpture neatly spread across Casta&ntilde;eda&rsquo;s periodization of art history into Spanish, American, and the Modern period culminating in the 1960s. Casta&ntilde;eda interviewed a number of the architects and artists whose works are cited or discussed in the book and he also did research in the Philippine National Archives. Written in a narrative and descriptive fashion, the broad picture of Philippine architecture has the advantage of presenting factual information he gathered from the very practitioners who are the subject of his book, many of whom were his contemporaries and colleagues in the UP CFA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Casta&ntilde;eda&rsquo;s division of arts into architecture, painting, and sculpture betrays his academic and Western filter. Hardly anything is said about popular painting. His tripartite framework of Spanish, American, and Modern was the common framework used by critics and art schools when discussing art in the Philippines at that time. The framework is flawed for its assumptions that those who wield political and social power solely determine the flow of art, which is opposed to the belief that art arises from a variety of causes. Thus, when citing examples of the flow of art, he tends to focus on public buildings&mdash;civic and religious&mdash;as the indicators of the direction and trends in architecture. Except for a brief discussion on pre-Spanish dwelling, there is little said about the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/208\">indigenous roots and traditions</a> of architecture. It is then a history of the architecture from above, the big tradition rather than the small tradition. A similar viewpoint operates when he discusses sculpture and painting.

		"text": "<p>Published 1958. Author, Richard E. Ahlborn. <strong><em>Exchange News Quarterly</em></strong>; 1960 and 1963, <strong><em>Philippine Studies</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cultural historian and curator of the Division of Community Life of the Smithsonian&rsquo;s National Museum of American History, Richard E. Ahlborn went to the Philippines on a Fulbright grant in the 1950s. He was then a photographer for the Smithsonian&rsquo;s Department of Cultural History in the Museum of History and Technology. Aside from photographing the villages and peoples of the Cordillera, he photographed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a> and structures. He came to know a group of Filipino <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">heritage</a> enthusiasts who would pioneer in the study of colonial architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of his studies was projected to be a three-part series of which two were published. Ahlborn&rsquo;s research was done by a foreigner who had visited the Philippines and had seen the churches firsthand, unlike pioneers like Lourdes Diaz-Trechuelo or Pal Kelemen, who knew these churches only from archival sources and from correspondence with Philippine researchers and heritage enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the published articles, he adopted the term &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; to describe Philippine churches built during the colonial era, 1565-1898, a term commonly used by pioneer writers but which would later be critiqued or qualified. The article that appeared in 1958, &ldquo;Spanish-Philippine Churches: An Interpretation,&rdquo; is an overview, expanded in subsequent articles in 1960 and 1963. In the 1960 article about provinces near Manila, Ahlborn studies the churches in five provinces: Cavite, Bataan, Pampanga, Bulacan, and Rizal. For each place he writes a brief history, describes the church and sums up common characteristics of churches within a province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of Cavite he notes that most churches have an overlay of 19th century remodeling, grafted to the older church structure. Decorative elements from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">revivalist</a> architecture, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Neo-Gothic</a> arches are used, for instance, in Naic church. Cavite churches are also known for the following: first, the common use of the single aisle; second, the use of pilasters as articulation of the facade; third, the close-fitting cut stone of the facade; and finally the position of the bell tower generally sited to one side of the facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bataan churches were constructed under the Dominicans. Frequent repairs, however, were done due to earthquakes and other natural calamities and to Bataan&rsquo;s seaside location, which exposed the churches to enemies, like the Dutch in the 17th century. Churches have thick plastered walls and recent repairs and renovations that hide previous works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Pampanga churches come from the 18th century, like San Fernando, Lubao, Guagua, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/270\">Betis</a>, and Bacoor. Church facades belong to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance Classicist</a> style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bulacan, Ahlborn examined the church of Polo, Meycauayan, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/275\">Calumpit</a>. Calumpit&rsquo;s distinctive carving made him remark that these were certainly the work of local Asian craftsmen who have elevated Western form and subject matter to a mystic level and made one of the most unique and stylistically vital churches in central Luzon. Bulacan churches, he observes, have a few characteristic features: Facades are mostly extremely flat and may be decorated only by thin columns and simple niches. Pediments are equally simple and usually triangular. Stone carving also preserves the surface&rsquo;s planar quality and these are usually well made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rizal churches are typified by those of Binangonan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\">Tanay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">Morong</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/306\">Guadalupe</a>, Makati, and San Juan del Monte. Ahlborn notes that Rizal churches are relatively smaller than churches elsewhere. A good number have stonework often dating back to the first half of the 17th century. Morong&rsquo;s facade, however, was subsequently remodeled. This he describes at length, quoting Fr Felix Huerta, OFM, 1865. Stylistically, Rizal churches have relatively simple fronts, decorated by classical niches, cornices and columns and akin in its simplicity and straight forwardness to Classical renaissance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ahlborn&rsquo;s digression into how churches were built is worth reading given the oversimplification of the building process that is still prevalent. He points out that, during the first half of the 18th century, the process of church building begins with the land and building being donated by a generous donor. Once the resources for construction are assured, permission to construct is secured from the government. The Padre produces a rough sketch, which native and Chinese artisans interpret and produce. The parish house or <strong>convento</strong>, bell tower, and school follow. Tax exemption is an incentive for working and contributing to the town church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1963 essay on churches of Central Luzon, Ahlborn begins with an introduction on the evangelization and colonization of the Philippines, and then organizes the essay as itineraries that radiate out of Manila as a hub. He develops each itinerary in an analogous way as his previous publication on places near Manila. After defining Central Luzon as the area from Tayabas Bay to Lingayen Gulf, he begins his itinerary: first, from Manila to Zambales, Lingayen, and North Pangasinan; second, to Batangas and Laguna; and third, to Cavite, Pampanga, Bulacan, Bataan, and Rizal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zambales churches have simple styles and a somewhat attenuated classical scheme. Botolan has a bulky belfry resting on the pediment, which houses a number of bells. Pangasinan has many large churches usually made of bricks rather than stone. Churches are characterized by 1) heavy brick surfaces; 2) splendid multi-tiered bell towers or campanarios; and 3) simple facades decorated with pairs of thin, round pilasters. The Batangas churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">Taal</a> and Lipa, built in the 19th century, large and massive, are &ldquo;sufficient evidence of the eagerness and construction habits of the Augustinian missionaries in Batangas.&rdquo; Churches in Quezon that Ahlborn discusses are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/324\">Lucban</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/388\">Tayabas</a>, Mauban, and Atimonan. The earliest missionary center can be found in Laguna. Stylistically, Laguna churches present a simplified native classicism in their renovated facades, which adjoin earlier bell towers of more dramatic European designs. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/351\">Paete church</a> stands out because it has outstanding carved decoration.

Ahlborn went to the Philippines on a Fulbright grant in the 1950s. He was then a photographer for the Smithsonian&#x2019;s Department of Cultural History in the Museum of History and Technology. Aside from photographing the villages and peoples of the Cordillera, he photographed <a href=\"/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial</a> <a href=\"/2/5/244\">churches</a> and structures.

The article that appeared in 1958, &#x201C;Spanish-Philippine Churches: An Interpretation,&#x201D; is an overview, expanded in subsequent articles in 1960 and 1963. In the 1960 article about provinces near Manila, Ahlborn studies the churches in five provinces: Cavite, Bataan, Pampanga, Bulacan, and Rizal. For each place he writes a brief history, describes the church and sums up common characteristics of churches within a province."

Decorative elements from <a href=\"/2/4/217\">revivalist</a> architecture, like <a href=\"/2/4/217\">Neo-Gothic</a> arches are used, for instance, in Naic church. Cavite churches are also known for the following: first, the common use of the single aisle; second, the use of pilasters as articulation of the facade; third, the close-fitting cut stone of the facade; and finally the position of the bell tower generally sited to one side of the facade."

Calumpit&#x2019;s distinctive carving made him remark that these were certainly the work of local Asian craftsmen who have elevated Western form and subject matter to a mystic level and made one of the most unique and stylistically vital churches in central Luzon. Bulacan churches, he observes, have a few characteristic features: Facades are mostly extremely flat and may be decorated only by thin columns and simple niches. Pediments are equally simple and usually triangular. Stone carving also preserves the surface&#x2019;s planar quality and these are usually well made."

Questioning the opinion that &ldquo;Philippine colonial architecture, especially church architecture, was merely imitative of Spanish models and therefore unoriginal and uninteresting,&rdquo; (Legarda 1960, 121) he went on to do his own research to find out if it were so. Legarda followed the trail of writers on Mexican colonial architecture like P&aacute;l Kelemen who wrote about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial architecture</a> in the Philippines. Although this form was rarely photographed and still less studied, Kelemen showed how Spanish baroque spread through the islands. Although it was much altered, Legarda set out to look for what was unique in the Philippine examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He begins by clarifying that the &ldquo;Filipino element&rdquo; points to four aspects: first, the employment of local material by Filipino labor with Filipino expertise; second, use of local design, like local flora; third, the mingling of native elements with Spanish, Latin American, Chinese and other foreign influences and elements; and lastly, objects created for local use, became part of the local arena, and represent a mix of artistic elements located only in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comparing the Latin American with the Philippine experience, Legarda finds that the Spanish influence in the latter was much diminished.

He noted earthquake baroque elements (broad walls or buttresses) and Chinese elements (<em>Fu</em> dogs and baroque angels fighting Chinese dragons in Aringay). The typical Ilocano baroque has a low profile, an angular pitch of the roof, the embellishment of columns or piers against the wall without pediments, and the existence of numerous finials molded like urns, knobs, and pyramids. Although evangelized by one group, there is no uniform architecture for churches erected by that group. Generally, the churches leave a feeling of simplicity, sincerity, straightforwardness, and strength. Nine churches are treated in greater detail. Sixteen pages of plates with multiple images of the churches discussed in the essay are appended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1981 essay &ldquo;Angels in Clay&rdquo; follows the same lines of research as the work on Ilocos.

With these works behind her, Coseteng delineates the first synthetic picture of Philippine colonial architecture during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish era</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Divided into nine chapters, with a preface, introduction, glossary of chiefly architectural terms, index, and a folio of 159 photographic plates (mostly by Silverio Enriquez) and 37 illustrations or architectural sketches (some from archival sources, others drawn by Sammuel Alapan), the book is a sound and easy introduction to colonial architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1, &ldquo;Historical Background,&rdquo; distinguishes Philippine architecture from Spanish and Hispanic/Mexican colonial architecture and decries the comparison of Philippine architecture with foreign examples as &ldquo;invidious&rdquo; (Coseteng 1972, 3). Coseteng points to the uniqueness of Philippine architecture caused in part by the archipelago&rsquo;s physical separation from Mexico and Spain and its situation in Asia. Because of distance, very little personnel versed in architecture crossed the Pacific from Mexico. Likewise no Filipino, until the 19th century, crossed to Mexico and Spain.

A variation of the rectangle is cruciform where minor retablos are located at the transept; and (4) A choir loft, a timber-roofing structure like an inverted boat, and a bell tower complete the standard church.

Chapter 8, &ldquo;The Churches of Iloilo,&rdquo; discusses the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/390\">Tigbauan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao</a>, and Guimbal. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/353\">Pan-ay</a> which is in Capiz, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">Argao</a> in Cebu are under this chapter. Tigbauan offers Coseteng the opportunity to introduce the term <strong>tequitqui</strong>, coined by Mexican&nbsp;writer Jos&eacute; Moreno Villa to describe Mexican colonial architecture with marked influence of native aesthetics. Chapter 9, &ldquo;The Baroque Churches of Rizal, Laguna and Bicol,&rdquo; is about the churches of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">Morong</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\">Tanay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/351\">Paete</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/328\">Majayjay</a> in Rizal and Laguna, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/292\">Daraga</a> in the Bicol region. The book ends abruptly with this chapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coseteng&rsquo;s pioneering work has large gaps and sudden jumps. There is little discussion on the Bicol churches, which is understandable considering the difficulty of traveling to these places in the late 1960s, when the data for the book was being gathered. Also the organization of the book, while appearing to be geographical (Chapters 5-9) is in fact not entirely so, because stylistic and architectural features play a role in the choice of examples. This explains why Molo and Taal, which are not cathedrals are included in Chapter 4. The connection is that both are triple-naved. Argao appears in Chapter 8 which is on Iloilo because it is ornamented like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/390\">Tigbauan Church</a>. And the churches of Santo Ni&ntilde;o, Carcar, and Naga in Cebu are grouped together because these show characteristics of Muslim art, which, according to Coseteng, one sees more as one travels south. The term &ldquo;Muslim art&rdquo; is misleading and that confusion is noted in her statement: &ldquo;Features of Muslim art were adopted during the colonial era for purely artistic effect, whether they were [a] spontaneous, if unconscious expression of a latent or artistic tradition, it is quite difficult to be arbitrary about&rdquo; (Coseteng 1972, 85). The phrase &ldquo;latent or artistic tradition&rdquo; seems to suggest that the Muslim influence came from Mindanao. And this innuendo later becomes fact, when later popular writings misquote or misinterpret Coseteng. More precisely what the author labels &ldquo;Muslim&rdquo; should be called Mudejar&mdash;its roots are not in Mindanao but in Spain and the artistic tradition enjoyed a revival during the second half of the 19th century. Whatever Mudejar characteristics there might be in the Cebu churches these do not come from the Philippines. For example, Naga&rsquo;s Mudejar touches come from the architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2652\">Domingo de Escondrillas</a>, who was assigned to the public works office in Cebu. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.
