		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Acting</strong> is the art of creating a character in the film medium. The person who fulfills this aspect of film production is the actor. The actor and the film character are separate; in performance, however, the two merge and are perceived by the viewer as one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The performance of actors is judged by their ability to effectively portray a given character. Thus, good actors make the audience believe in the characters they portray through the creative use of voice, facial and body movements, gestures, and the manner in which they relate to other characters. Acting requires both instinct and intelligence. Instinct is important for the actor to give a unique interpretation to what is demanded by the role. More important is the intelligence to be able to understand and bring humanity to the character he is portraying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The actor is generally dependent on the director for guidance. Although film has many techniques for masking incompetence or errors in acting, or enhancing the performance (such as editing, camera movement, composition, and others), acting ability, nonetheless, is essential if the actor wishes to be truly successful. In musicals and action films, singing talent and skills in martial arts, respectively, may also be necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">According to generally acceptable standards, there are four factors to a screen actor&rsquo;s performance. The <b>physical dynamics</b> of a character refers to the actor&rsquo;s physique, movements, physical features, and personality traits that can be used to help the actor delineate a character. The <b>inner spirit</b> of the character refers to the actor&rsquo;s ability to reveal subtle emotions and shadings of a character. The <b>cinematic control</b> of the character refers to the proper use of the film medium or the actor&rsquo;s ability to create a character without resorting to overplaying or underplaying. The <b>truth of the character</b> refers to the effective revelation of character. Filipino actors, it is widely believed, are intuitive and sensitive performers. Though seriously handicapped by the lack of professional training, these actors often rely on their own skills to enable them to project ideas and emotions effectively, demonstrating a wide range of talent in the process. A remarkable number of able performers from every generation of screen professionals have achieved eminence through their own skills and talents, and through exposure to different roles given to them by producers and directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There was a time in the history of Philippine cinema when the aesthetics of film acting was limited to the portrayal of traditional roles as found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a> and the <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a>. </i>Actors who had performed on stage first necessarily brought with them into the cinema such conventions of stage acting as larger-than-life facial and body movements, stereotyped reactions, and conventional gestures. Also retained in the process was the one-dimensional characterization of traditional dramas. This simplistic characterization was perpetuated in film, forcing many performers to do typecast roles of heroes or villains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This type of acting was further enhanced with the rise of radio soap operas from the 1940s to the 1960s where voice acting and highly emotional rendition of memorable lines defined good drama and therefore a credible performance. The popularity of the melodrama as Filipino entertainment was evident in the tearjerkers that showcased the talents of the most popular actors and actresses from the 1950s to the 1960s. These included the likes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4401\">Rosa del Rosario</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4512\">Anita Linda</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4418\">Tita Duran</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4522\">Pancho Magalona</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\">Leopoldo Salcedo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4581\">Carlos Padilla</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4463\">Armando Goyena</a>, followed by the generation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4460\">Rita Gomez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4362\">Marlene Dauden</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4644\">Lolita Rodriguez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4688\">Charito Solis</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4643\">Eddie Rodriguez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4635\">Dante Rivero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4682\">Vic </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1004\">Silayan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4273\">Robert Arevalo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4451\">Eddie Garcia</a>. For the longest time, typecasting prevented actors from developing their acting talents in the realistic mode. But it is to the credit of many of these actors that they were versatile enough to develop internalized acting when the newer directors called for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development of stars into actors was attempted by a number of big studios during the 1950s. At <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, for instance, the acting coach of female stars was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4547\">Rosa Mia</a>, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4391\">Van de Leon</a> and Lucas Paredes guided actors in the delivery and interpretation of their roles. Those who were being built up as major talents were given additional courses in social graces and grooming and were exposed to many social functions outside the studio. At <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, the major stars were under the personal tutelage of the grand matriarch Do&ntilde;a Sisang. The same setup was implemented at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4508\">Lebran</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, another generation of actors emerged. These actors were shaped by a new batch of university-trained and independent-minded directors. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>, who trained in theater, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>, who studied filmmaking abroad, were at the forefront of the emerging cinema. Displaying maturity and sensitivity to their material, they insisted on sincerity and truthfulness of characterization. Brocka discovered and developed new talents like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4491\">Hilda Koronel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4385\">Christopher de Leon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4476\">Jay llagan</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4640\">Bembol Roco</a>. Bernal, on the other hand, transformed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> into the country&rsquo;s best thespians. Later, Brocka would add to his list of discoveries such names as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4667\">Phillip Salvador</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4253\">Gina Alajar</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4513\">Mona Lisa</a>, whose careers were successfully revived by their mentor. However, the 1970s also saw more television dramas gaining popularity and therefore defining what constitutes good acting in the eyes of the <i>masa </i>(masses). Like traditional acting before it, the standard of such acting was exemplified by <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a> </i></b>(Wheel of Fortune), starring Marianne de la Riva and Ronald Corveau, with the young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4958\">Romnick Sarmenta</a>; <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b>, starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4465\">Laurice Guillen</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4434\">Dindo Fernando</a>, Herbert Bautista, and the young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4368\">Janice de Belen</a>; and <b><i>Anna Liza</i></b>, starring Julie Vega.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Armed with a theater background, Laurice Guillen became part of the efforts to professionalize acting in local cinema. Guillen and husband actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4403\">Johnny Delgado</a> were instrumental in the training of fellow actors in the 1980s through the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4244\">Actors&rsquo; Workshop</a>, which they founded. Although the Actors&rsquo; Workshop is not a formal acting school, it succeeded in putting method into the largely untrained raw potential of screen thespians. Using the &ldquo;Being Method&rdquo; developed from Stanislavsky by American acting coach Eric Morris, the workshop, at one point, became the only &ldquo;formal&rdquo; training ground for local actors. The Actors Guild&mdash;also known as the Kapisanan ng mga Artistang Pilipino sa Pelikula at Telebisyon&mdash;and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines</a> both endeavored to enhance the growth and development of the acting profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other directors, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\">Marilou Diaz-Abaya</a>, were known to put their actors in a workshop before production in order to orient them. Cases like these are rare, however, and most directors today still rely on the raw talent of their stars to portray roles that have been identified with their screen image. A good number of the country&rsquo;s better actors, like Gina Alajar, Bembol Roco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4487\">Jaclyn Jose</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4393\">Michael de Mesa</a>, for that matter, became relegated to doing supporting roles and making occasional appearances that do little justice to their enormous talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But the rise of the independent filmmaking scene has opened new possibilities for these artists to flex their acting muscles. Certified actors who have been able to still show what it really means to be an actor with small indie<i> </i>movies that showcase their talents include the likes of Anita Linda, Eddie Garcia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4588\">Gina Pare&ntilde;o</a>, Jaclyn Jose, Gina Alajar, Michael de Mesa,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4673\">Judy Ann Santos</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4706\">Joel Torre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4363\">Ricky Davao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4599\">Cherry Pie Pichache</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4454\">Cherie Gil</a>, Isabel Lopez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4406\">Julio Diaz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4506\">Ronnie Lazaro</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Mylene Dizon</a>. To this day, icons like Nora Aunor and Vilma Santos continue to reap accolades not only for themselves but for the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There is also a new generation of performers, many of them from theater, who stood out from the independent movie scene to show that they are there for the art and not merely for the prize that comes with the celebrity status. Examples of these actors are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4536\">Coco Martin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4394\">Alessandra de Rossi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4518\">Sid Lucero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4267\">Angel Aquino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2721\">Irma Adlawan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4415\">Eugene Domingo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2834\">Shamaine Centenera-Buencamino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2804\">Nonie Buencamino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4271\">John Arcilla</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3349\">Lou Veloso</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4541\">Pen Medina</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2864\">Soliman Cruz</a>, Hazel Orencio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4587\">Angelica Panganiban</a>, Mercedes Cabral, Joem Bascon, Sue Prado, Joey Paras, Ina Feleo, Mara Lopez, Ping Medina, Alex Medina, Karl Medina, Victor Medina, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4292\">Angeli </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\">Bayani</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Acting as an art and a craft evolves and matures as it responds to the changes happening not only in local cinema but all over the world.

Although the Actors&#x2019; Workshop is not a formal acting school, it succeeded in putting method into the largely untrained raw potential of screen thespians. Using the &#x201C;Being Method&#x201D; developed from Stanislavsky by American acting coach Eric Morris, the workshop, at one point, became the only &#x201C;formal&#x201D; training ground for local actors.

It serves as a repository for documents of historical value. The person having charge of the archives is called the <b>film archivist</b>. The main functions of the film archivist are selection, retrieval, and acquisition of important film records; preservation, restoration, and storage; cataloguing and documentation; and diffusion of the film culture or giving the public access to the film collection. In many parts of the world, film archivists are tasked to preserve not only the film medium but also magnetic recordings in video and audio formats and pertinent documents like photographs, correspondence, news items, posters, brochures, screenplays, and the like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the developing countries in Asia, the Philippines has the longest film history, dating back to as early as 1897, when it was still a colony of Spain. The moving pictures that were exhibited during this period were made of such fragile organic, celluloid material that in time they easily deteriorated and are now forever lost. The coming of the Americans to the Philippines at the turn of the century was recorded in films, which were transferred on paper (a more stable medium) by the Edison Company so it could copyright its works. It is this &ldquo;<b>paper film</b>&rdquo; that has survived and was later recopied into celluloid once again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1912, when the first Filipino feature film, <b><i>La Vida de</i></b> <b><i><strong> <strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </i></b>(The Life of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>), was produced in the country by Dr Edward Meyer Gross, to the present (2018), the Philippines has suffered an incalculable loss in its film heritage due to the lack of a permanent national film archives. It is ironic that a 1940 newsreel about the funeral of one of the country&rsquo;s more popular cinema figures, the actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4343\">Rudy Concepcion</a>, is preserved and stored in the Japanese film archives in Tokyo but no copy is available in the Philippines. Film owners have generally been unsuccessful in keeping their master negatives and other film properties intact, although studios like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a> have exerted considerable efforts to preserve their films. Studio fires resulting from poor storage of nitrate films and the bombing and shelling of Manila during World War II wiped out productions prior to 1946 save for a handful of titles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) was established in 1981, one of its five modules was known as the Film Archives of the Philippines. The other four were Alternative Cinema, Film Fund, Film Ratings Board, and Manila International Film Festival. The ECP was short-lived, and it was replaced in 1984 by the Film Foundation of the Philippines (FFP), which in turn was dissolved in 1986 following the EDSA Revolt. Prior to the dissolution of the ECP and FFP, the film archives were transferred to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4910\">Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)</a>. From 1986 to 1992, the film archives under the MTRCB have functioned as a storage facility or repository of old films alongside censored films or movies that have been withdrawn from exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The University of the Philippines Film Center (UPFC), established in 1976, put up its own film archives with the acquisition of master negatives and film records from Bancom Audiovision Corporation. The services offered by the UPFC then were cleaning and repair of films, temporary restoration to reduce the brittle inflexibility of old films, and transfer of 16 mm print to video. Technical evaluation reports were given to film owners so that they understood the condition of their films when they decided to reissue or deposit in the archives. The archives have since been turned over to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4439\">Film Development Council of the Philippines (FDCP)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) had its own archival collection. This includes the turn-of-the-century films acquired from the United States Library of Congress; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> collection; some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a> films; and productions of Sampaguita Pictures, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4507\">Lea Productions</a>, Tamaraw Films, and AM (Amalia Muhlach) Productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A major archival treasure, which was turned over to the Philippine government by the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990, is the newly restored version of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1249\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (Touch Me Not), 1961. This was made possible through the joint efforts of the Goethe Institut Manila, the German Embassy in Manila, the Federal Archive in Bonn, the Federal Archive in Koblenz, and Lufthansa. Chief restorer Harold Brandes used a special copying machine that produced a new duplicate negative after repairing all perforation damage on the only surviving but severely deteriorated 35 mm film copy. Afterward, the sound was copied on an intermediate film, from which a new sound negative was made. The new theater copy made from the 35 mm picture and sound negative was shown at a special screening at the Manila Film Center on 22 May 1990, during the commemoration of &ldquo;Gerardo de Leon Year.&rdquo; In 1992, the CCP invited Philippe Brunetaud to lecture at a Film Conservation Workshop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the area of <b>film documentation</b>, a few vital works that are comprehensive in scope have been accomplished by film researchers and librarians: &ldquo;Philippine Motion Pictures, 1908-1958: A Checklist of the First Fifty Years,&rdquo; 1979, by Carmencita Momblanco; &ldquo;Filmography of Philippine Film 1959-1989,&rdquo; 1995, by Arnulfo Junio; &ldquo;Union Catalog on Philippine Culture: Film,&rdquo; 1990, by the CCP Library Staff then headed by Carol Afan; and the filmography sections of all four <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/25/1334\">Urian anthologies</a>, edited by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a>. The Momblanco work is a master&rsquo;s thesis presented to the UP Institute of Library Science containing 1,379 bibliographic entries that document the movie industry&rsquo;s film releases from 1908 to 1958. The Junio work continues the Momblanco filmography to three decades after. The Afan catalog consists of 3,642 bibliographic entries of printed materials, published and unpublished, written by Filipinos or foreign authors dealing solely or mainly with Philippine film. The Tiongson anthologies provide production data on the films exhibited in the Philippines for four decades, from 1970 to 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Starting in the 1990s, there were two associations actively involved in matters concerning the state of film archives in the Philippines: the National Committee on Archives under the Sub-Commission on Cultural Heritage of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4566\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4687\">Society of Filipino Archivists for Film (SOFIA)</a>. In 1993, SOFIA was established through the cooperation of professionals who believed in the value of film preservation and film restoration. SOFIA organized several seminars and workshops that focused on the collection, preservation, and archiving of important films. Through the years, SOFIA has exerted a tremendous amount of effort in initiating the preservation of several Filipino classic films through their cooperation with several organizations, such as the CCP, NCCA, the Goethe-Institut, and others. Most of SOFIA&rsquo;s promotion and restoration projects are carried out through financial assistance that comes from the NCCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few private institutions are actively involved in film archiving. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a> Film Archives, the biggest of these institutions, currently holds over three thousand film prints from several companies like Sampaguita Pictures, LVN Pictures, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a>, Seiko Films, and OctoArts Films. In 2011, the network also established the ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project together with Central Digital Lab, aiming to restore classic Filipino films. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><strong>Himala</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Miracle</i></b>), 1982, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a> was the first film to be restored. The newly restored version of the film was shown in the 69th Venice International Film Festival. Several films have been restored since then, including <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1256\">Oro, Plata, Mata</a> </i></b>(<b><i>Gold, Silver, Death</i></b>), 1982; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1204\"><strong>Karnal</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Of the Flesh</i></b>), 1983; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1166\"><b><i>Ganito Kami Noon &hellip; Paano Kayo Ngayon?</i></b></a> (This Was How We Were &hellip; What Happens to You Now?), 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other private archives include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\">Mowelfund</a> Audiovisual Archive, which houses a collection of short films and documentaries, and the FPJ film archive, which holds a collection of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr</a>&rsquo;s films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2011, after a long clamor for a national film archive, the National Film Archives of the Philippines (NFAP) was established through the initiative of the FDCP. The NFAP spearheads projects that aim to protect and restore the films that give shape to our national identity. So far, the NFAP has initiated the restoration of classic films like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1167\"><strong>Genghis Khan</strong></a></i></b>, 1950, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><strong>Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Manila: In the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1975, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1267\"><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></a></i></b>, 1965, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></i></b>, 1976. <b><i>Maynila </i></b>and <b><i>Insiang </i></b>were restored in cooperation with Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s Film Foundation through its World Cinema Project.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Anella Mendoza and Lena S.

Class A is composed of the upper class. This consists of the top and senior business executives, large-scale entrepreneurs, landlords, and licensed professionals (such as doctors, lawyers, engineers, and architects). Class B is the upper middle class. This includes mid-level executives (such as business managers and assistant managers), medium-scale entrepreneurs, and medium-size landowners. Class C, the middle class, is made up of junior business executives, mid-level professionals, small entrepreneurs, small farm owners, senior white-collar workers, and skilled workers. Group D, the lower class, consists of semiskilled workers and blue-collar workers. Group E, the extreme lower class, includes the unskilled workers, vendors, and the unemployed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first audiences for the Filipino film belonged to the lower class who delighted in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><i>komedya</i></a>,<i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\">sinakulo</a></i>,<i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a></i>,<i> </i>and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><i>drama</i></a> in the first three decades of the 20th century, and the <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\">bodabil</a> </i>in the decade before the Pacific War. Raised on these theater forms, these urban audiences looked for the same themes, stories,<i> </i>characters, settings, and even stars in the first Filipino films. The taste of this audience for popular stage fare<i> </i>was reinforced when stage artists and technicians who went into film brought with them the content and<i> </i>conventions of traditional theater.

Film director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a> coined the term &ldquo;<b>bakya crowd</b>&rdquo; (after the cheap wooden clogs they usually wore) for this audience who seemed unable to appreciate &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; movies, preferring to be entertained by romantic melodramas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1059\">action</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1068\">comedy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1065\">fantasy</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\">horror</a> films.

Foreign films were not shown in these theaters during the festival. In 1975, the MFF became the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF), which also required all cinemas in Metro Manila to exhibit only Filipino films during the Christmas season. Through the years, the audience of the MMFF increased. In 2015, the box-office earnings of the MMFF official film entries reached more than a billion pesos. The movie audiences were composed of families, adults, teenagers, and children who could afford to pay the movie ticket ranging from 200 pesos to 250 pesos. The 2015 box-office results showed that this movie audience preferred comedy (<b><i>Beauty and the Bestie</i></b>), romance-comedy (<b><i>My Bebe Love</i></b> and <b><i>Walang Forever</i></b><i> </i>[No Forever]), and horror (<b><i>Haunted Mansion</i></b>).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rise of the middle class who could still afford to spend for movies gave way to the emergence of multiplexes in the malls.

The annual awards rites conducted by the various groups and organizations in the country confer honors on movie people as a measure of recognition for their efforts and achievements in the film industry. Film grants are special subsidies given to deserving filmmakers in order to help them in their craft and ensure realization of a proposed project. This may come in the form of travel grants, scholarships, and subsidies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Movie industry awards were first conferred by the Manila Times Publishing Company: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4535\">Maria Clara Awards</a> in recognition of the best films and performances of 1950 and 1951. When the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> was established on 31 May 1953 to honor the best film achievements for 1952, the Maria Clara Awards bowed out of existence. Patterned after the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood, FAMAS originally counted as members people from the movie industry itself. Among the original members were directors, actors, cinematographers, scriptwriters, musical directors, sound directors, and film editors. In addition, members from the movie press, who had no direct involvement in the work of movie people, were invited to counteract possible biases expected from so-called loyalty votes of industry colleagues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The FAMAS criteria emphasized that &ldquo;a picture should be judged in its totality as it strikes the perceptual senses&rdquo; and &ldquo;a motion picture should possess more than mere realism.&rdquo; The concern of the FAMAS was on formal aspects of filmmaking, such as scriptwriting, direction, acting, cinematography, editing, sound, and music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 1 May 1976, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a> (MPP) was organized by academicians and journalists &ldquo;to stimulate dialogue between the moviegoers and the film industry, to explore directions for the improvement of films, and to develop awareness of the responsibility of film as a medium of expression and communication, given the conditions of contemporary filmmaking in the Philippines.&rdquo; The MPP considers both content and form in its evaluation of a film. In the MPP criteria, &ldquo;the content of the film is considered superior if it is a truthful portrayal of the human condition as perceived by the Filipino, and if it deals with the Filipino experience to which the greater number of moviegoers can relate.&rdquo; Form is artistic if the filmmakers are able &ldquo;to use and integrate creatively the various elements of cinema direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, production design, editing, music, and sound.&rdquo; The MPP emphasizes the need to integrate the various elements that contribute to the totality of a film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1978, two years after the institution of the MPP, the Archdiocese of Manila, headed by Jaime Cardinal Sin, established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4781\">Catholic Mass Media Awards (CMMA)</a>. It was organized with the sole purpose of rewarding film and other media products &ldquo;which transmit genuine human values to their audience through the competent and professional use of the appropriate mass media techniques.&rdquo; The CMMA&rsquo;s foremost concern was the &ldquo;role of mass media in creating a humane society.&rdquo; CMMA standards and criteria stress the significance of the moral, social, and spiritual values that film and other mass media impart to their audience. The CMMA jurors represent a cross section of media, business, trade, academic, and socio-civic groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On 5 Jan 1981, leaders of the film industry established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP)</a> as the official awards body of the industry tasked to confer its own annual awards that reflect the opinion of industry technicians and artists. In its criteria, the FAP stressed the value of team effort, to which individual merit must be subordinated. &ldquo;It is the cohesive, intermingling effort of the group that must come into play, from director, actor, script, editing, cinematography, music, sound, and production design put together.&rdquo; A film, to be adjudged excellent, has to achieve a high degree of credibility and realism. The FAP defines realism in the context of a film&rsquo;s ability to portray its message believably, &ldquo;whether it is a true-to-life story or a science-fiction fantasy.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1984, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4598\">Philippine Movie Press Club (PMPC)</a> established its own &ldquo;Star Awards&rdquo; to honor outstanding members of the film industry for their achievements in various aspects of film.

The CCP has sponsored a Film Grants Program for new talented filmmakers, offering funding and a guaranteed venue for video features, documentaries, experimental films, and animation.

Cinema first came to the Philippines during the last days of Spanish colonial rule when there was no film censorship. During the first two decades of American rule, films imported from Europe and the United States (US) enjoyed unlimited freedom of exhibition. It was only when Filipinos started producing their own movies that some sectors of the community saw the need for measures to control moviemaking activities. This was presumably the result of a protest lodged by the Spanish community that resented the showing of a film by JulianManansala titled <b><i>Patria</i></b> <b><i>Amore </i></b>(Beloved Country), which, opened at the Palace Theater on 23 Jul 1929. What Manansala intended as a nationalist work was perceived by the Spaniards as a movie with &ldquo;anti-Spanish sentiments.&rdquo; The protesters filed a court injunction to stop the exhibition of the movie. An American-dominated board, however, denied the plea for an injunction. Nevertheless, the authorities had been alerted. Four months later, on 27 Nov 1929, the Philippine Legislature established the first censors body by approving &ldquo;An Act to Create a Board of Censorship for Motion Pictures and Define Its Functions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the early Filipino movies that provoked the censors&rsquo; ire was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>&rsquo; <b><i>Batang Tulisan</i></b> (Young Bandit), 1937. The film was found objectionable not only for its title, which the censors feared would infect the youth with &ldquo;certain subversive ideas,&rdquo; but also for the presentation of a priest in a villainous role; the use of a hypodermic, poison-laden injection as a murder weapon; and the courtship scenes between a boy and a girl who were both 10 years of age. Interestingly, these same scenes were depicted in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5177\">Gregorio Coching</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> </i></b>magazine serial that ran for several weeks before the screenplay based on the novel was completed. No objections were raised at the time the magazine serial came out. But the producers had no choice; they had to re-edit the film and change its title to <b><i>Binatang Parang </i></b>(Barrio Swain) so that it could be shown some six months later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The prewar years were relatively peaceful and without controversy for the board. Filipino movie fare favored <i>sarsuwela</i> cum Hollywood-style musicals in the Philippine setting, like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\">Bituing Marikit</a> </i></b>(Beautiful Star) 1937, <b><i>Paroparong Bukid </i></b>(Country Butterfly), <b><i>Arimunding-Munding</i></b>, 1938, <b><i><strong> <strong>Bahay Kubo</strong> </strong> </i></b> (Nipa Hut) 1938, and <b><i><strong>Leron-Leron Sinta</strong> </i></b> (Leron-Leron Beloved), 1939.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the Japanese occupation period from 1942 to 1943, film censorship was handled by the Bureau of Information and Public Security under the Commission of the Interior. In 1944, the function was absorbed by the Board of Information (Hodobu), also known as the Propaganda Corps. The following were considered censorable and subject to confiscation: anti-Japanese propaganda, advocacy of democracy, attempts to alienate the Axis powers from one another, repudiation of the war, opposition to the fundamental principles of the educational renovations in the Philippines, and exposure of alleged improper conduct of the military administration. These restrictions were applied not only to film but also to radio, stage shows, and printed media. It was the role of the Hodobu to control, direct, supervise, and coordinate all the information and publicity activities of the Philippine Republic. Only two feature films were made during this period, the war epic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1214\"><b><i>Dawn of Freedom</i></b></a>, 1944, and a drama advocating the return to country living, <b><i><strong>Tatlong Maria</strong> </i></b>(Three Marys), 1944. Both films were produced and distributed by the Bureau of Southern Areas of the Movie Distribution Compan <strong>y</strong> (Eiga Haikyusha).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Immediately after the war, film producers resumed work and a new Board of Review for Moving Pictures was established by Pres Manuel A. Roxas in 1946. The first film to come under fire in the postwar period was Premiere Productions&rsquo; <b><i>Ako Raw Ay Huk</i></b> (They Call Me Rebel), 1946, a film that explored the life of a member of the peasant guerrilla organization known as Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa mga Hapon (Hukbalahap). Government representatives on the board found the material objectionable. Because of this film, officials of the Philippine Constabulary (PC) considered the idea of requiring future scripts to be approved by the PC before they were filmed. Some journalists on the board, including Teodoro A. Valencia (who later was to become board chair), refused to abide by the principle of prior censorship. <b><i>Ako Raw Ay Huk </i></b>was finally approved under a new title, <b><i>Labi ng Digmaan</i></b> (Survivor of War), 1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the late 1950s and early 1960s, crime and violence became the big issues. This trend would continue up to the 1970s and even the 1980s, when the censors would run into the same problem. As early as 1962, <b><i><strong>Maliw</strong> alu </i></b>was banned because of its portrayal of excessive violence, but the board&rsquo;s decision was overruled by an Appeals Committee (composed of the undersecretaries of defense, justice, and education) that later allowed its showing after the controversial portions were deleted. In 1963, the board was again in the center of controversy when the permit for the movie <b><i>Ang Manananggol ni Ruben </i></b>(The Lawyer of Ruben) was withdrawn after four days of exhibition. The notoriety of Ruben Ablaza, who was convicted in the real-life sensational rape case involving Annabelle Higgins, was cited by the board as its main reason for revoking the permit. When the movie was finally approved and shown, the controversial Ablaza sequence had been deleted and its title shortened to <b><i>Ang Manananggol </i></b>(The Lawyer).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two other films censored in the 1960s had nothing to do with either crime or violence. Politics and freedom of expression became the issues in <b><i>Iginuhit ng</i></b> <b><i><strong>Tadhana</strong> </i></b>(Destined by Fate), 1965, purportedly about the life of then presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos, while religious discrimination was the charge against <b><i>Perlas</i></b> <b><i>ng Silangan </i></b>(Pearl of the Orient), 1969. The <b><i>Iginuhit </i></b>controversy was finally settled by a Supreme Court decision in favor of the producers who invoked freedom of expression in cinema. In the case of <b><i>Perlas</i></b> <b><i>ng Silangan</i></b>, the provincial board of Sulu Province protested that the movie &ldquo;misrepresented Muslim customs and defamed Islam.&rdquo; Again, the film was eventually shown in a watered-down version.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Jul 1970, film producer/director Ruben Abalos opened the floodgates for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1061\"><b>bomba</b></a> with his <b><i>Uhaw </i></b>(Thirsty) starring sultry Merle Fernandez. This was followed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Nympha </i></b>(Nymph) and other bomba films like <b><i>Luray </i></b>(Ravaged), <b><i>Hidhid </i></b>(Sex-Starved), <b><i>Daing </i></b>(Moan), <b><i>Busog </i></b>(Sated), <b><i>Haliparot </i></b>(Flirt), <b><i>Patigasan </i></b>(The Harder One Wins), <b><i>Ang Bukid ay Basa </i></b>(The Field Is Wet), <b><i>Saging</i></b> <b><i>ni Pacing </i></b>(Pacing&rsquo;s Banana), <b><i>Batuta ni Drakula </i></b>(Dracula&rsquo;s Nightstick), <b><i>Ako sa Itaas, Ikaw sa Ibaba</i></b> (Me on Top, You Under), 1971; mainstream cinema, in the words of then censors&rsquo; chief Guillermo de Vega, &ldquo;went wayward and floundered in a stream of gross sensationalism and bad taste.&rdquo; The continued proliferation of bomba films in the 1970s led to the forced resignation of the censors&rsquo; board members. The public indignation over the showing of <b><i>Mga Uhaw na Bulaklak</i></b> (Thirsty Flowers), 1976, ultimately resulted in the dissolution of the entire board and the creation of a new and stricter group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ironically, this was one of the finest periods in mainstream Philippine cinema, which saw the emergence of a new breed of filmmakers. Subsequently, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, Celso Ad. Castillo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\">Marilou Diaz-Abaya</a> would also at various times in this period be embroiled in issues of censorship with the censors&rsquo; chief, Maria Kalaw Katigbak, and later, Manuel Morato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The case of Behn Cervantes&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Sakada</strong> </i></b>(Seasonal Cane Workers), 1976, was equally controversial. The film, which was critical of the landlords in Negros province, attracted the attention of the military who confiscated the prints of the film. Though it was shown on a limited run, its permit was subsequently revoked and all its prints confiscated by military agents. In a city in Negros, landlords reportedly bought the booking rights two weeks in advance so that the moviegoers there, many of them sakada, would not get to see it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1980s, sex movies enjoyed an unprecedented degree of freedom mainly in the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) venue at the Manila Film Center, especially during the Manila International Film Festival. This prompted the Catholic Women&rsquo;s League to stage its biggest rally against both the ECP and the Manila Film Center, which showcased &ldquo;explicit&rdquo; films by renowned filmmakers such as Nagisa Oshima&rsquo;s <b><i>In the Realm of the Senses</i></b>, 1976,<b><i> </i></b>and Bernardo Bertolluci&rsquo;s <b><i>1900</i></b>, 1976, as well as Filipino sex-oriented films like <b><i>Snake Sisters</i></b>, 1984, <b><i>Isla </i></b>(Island), 1985, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1286\"><i>Scorpio Nights</i></a></strong>,<b><i> </i></b>1985, and <b><i>Boatman</i></b>, 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1985, the board was renamed Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB), but the same guidelines continued. Although the board claims that its work is mainly classification, some artists continue to raise issues of censorship against the MTRCB as well as questions regarding the composition and qualification of its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manuel L. Morato wielded the scissors from 1986 to 1992 as chair of the MTRCB under Pres Corazon C. Aquino&rsquo;s administration. Morato banned Martin Scorsese&rsquo;s <b><i>The Last</i></b> <b><i>Temptation of Christ</i></b>, 1988, an adaptation of Nikos Kazantzakis&rsquo;s novel.The Morato board also banned the Filipino documentary <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1430\"><b><i>Dear Sam &hellip; Sumasaiyo, Juan</i></b></a> (Dear Sam &hellip; Yours, Juan), 1989, for its anti-US bases position in Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base. Lino Brocka&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1255\"><strong>Orapronobis</strong></a></i></b>, 1989, was not spared censorship because it attacks human rights violations&mdash;specifically, the vigilantes&mdash;under the Cory regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Then, Pres Fidel V. Ramos appointed Atty Henrietta S. Mendez MTRCB chair from 1992 to 1995. The Mendez board created an uproar for banning Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s <b><i>Schindler&rsquo;s List</i></b>, 1993, for sex and nudity; Jane Campion&rsquo;s <b><i>The Piano</i></b>, 1993, for sex and adultery; and Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s <b><i>The Bridges of Madison County</i></b>, 1995, for the brief scene showing the pubic hair of Meryl Streep. An Appeals Committee was formed, which could overturn an MTRCB decision on a film rated X twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Former presidential press secretary and journalist Jesus &ldquo;Jess&rdquo; S. Sison followed Etta Mendez as MTRCB chief from 1995 to 1998. Sison introduced the policy of allowing only television programs rated General Patronage (GP) to be aired from 6:00 am to 7:00 pm. All other shows rated Parental Guidance (PG) could be shown only from 8:00 pm to 6:00 am. Sison paid close attention to titles. Basa, for instance, was changed to <b><i>Basa sa Dagat</i></b> (Sea-Drenched), 1995, <b><i>Tikim </i></b>to<b><i> Patikim ng Pinya</i></b> (Let Me Taste the Pineapple), 1996, and <b><i>Daigdig ng mga Toro</i></b> (World of Bulls) to <b><i><strong>Halimuyak</strong> ng Babae</i></b> (Scent of a Woman), 1996.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Producer-actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\">Armida Siguion-Reyna</a> was the MTRCB chair under Pres <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> from 1998 to 2001. Her board now had more members from the movie and television industries than the preceding boards, and more than half of the members came from the industry, which had never happened before. As insiders or practicing artists, the board was comparatively more lenient than the past boards. Perhaps the most controversial films approved during Siguion-Reyna&rsquo;s time were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1213\"><b><i>Live Show</i></b></a> (aka <b><i>Toro</i></b>), 2001, and <b><i>Sutla </i></b>(Silk), 1999. <b><i>Laging</i></b> <b><i>Sariwa </i></b>(Always Fresh), 1999, <b><i>Dugo ng Birhen </i></b>(Virgin&rsquo;s Blood), 1999, and <b><i>Monay</i></b> (Bread Roll) got an X because, opined the review committees, the sex scenes were not necessary to the story. <b><i>Live Show</i></b>, though approved on second review, did not get screened in theaters during Siguion-Reyna&rsquo;s time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite their liberalism, however, it can be said that this board was just as strict as the boards before them. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a>, former vice-chair of Siguion-Reyna, stated that &ldquo;from July 1998 to October 1999, the Siguion-Reyna board gave an X rating &hellip; to a total of 37 films&mdash;of which 12, despite a degree of pruning in some cases, went on to get another X on second review&hellip;. In the first year and three months of the Board&rsquo;s existence, we closed down 52 theaters, primarily for allowing minors into Adults Only movies. Compare that with records of the past boards: three years of the Sison board, 45 theaters closed; three years of the Etta Mendez board, 32 theaters closed; six years of the Morato board, no record on file.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film critic and educator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a> became the MTRCB chair from 2 Feb 2001 to 21 Mar 2001 after Erap resigned as president. Since the permit to exhibit the critically acclaimed <b><i>Live Show</i></b> was still valid, it was finally screened in Philippine theaters. It elicited the ire of the Catholic Church, and Pres Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, pressured by the Church, ordered the public screening of the said film stopped. After only less than three weeks as chair, Tiongson resigned in protest against what he considered an illegal banning of the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pres Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo then picked writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5653\">Alejandro (Anding) R. Roces</a> to replace Tiongson. Not a lot of fireworks happened during Roces&rsquo;s term between 4 Apr 2001 and 21 Jun 2002 that would send showbiz reporters agog with &ldquo;newsworthy&rdquo; tidbits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marilen Y. Dinglasan followed Anding Roces, and served as MTRCB chief from 22 Jun 2002 to 7 Nov 2002. It was during Dinglasan&rsquo;s time when a new law turned over to MTRCB the responsibility of reviewing and classifying DVD, VHS, and other optical media materials. This task used to be performed by the Optical Media Board, then headed by actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4531\">Edu Manzano</a>. Atty Dennis G. Manicad took over after Dinglasan as officer-in-charge from 8 Nov 2002 to 26 Feb 2003. Again, it was a relatively quiet period as the board members of MTRCB conscientiously did their job, with nothing much of a change from the policies of the past boards. Erring theaters would be closed, producers and filmmakers would be penalized, all according to law and the internal rules and regulations of the MTRCB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Consoliza P. Laguardia was MTRCB chair from 27 Feb 2003 until 22 Oct 2010. A movie fan, Laguardia would readily be available as reviewer, especially if a committee lacked a reviewer. She watched quite a number of local and foreign movies, and was in her element, so to speak, when movie stars and starlets would visit the office. She was much aware of issues of violations committed by television personalities, such as Rufa Mae Quinto, Lolit Solis, Willie Revillame, and Joey de Leon. She also ordered the closure of some theaters, but played safe when it came to political films. An episode of the broadcast documentary <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1498\">Reporter&rsquo;s Notebook</a> </i></b>that featured an indigenous tradition of giant wooden phalluses was axed for airing on GMA 7. Furthermore, a short film regarding the oil spill in Guimaras in Panay Gulf was not given a permit for public exhibition perhaps so as not to highlight government negligence. Then, a biopic in the format of a documentary on ex-president Joseph Estrada was rated X on first and second reviews. The movie <b><i>The Da Vinci Code</i></b>, 2006, an adaptation of Dan Brown&rsquo;s novel of the same title, directed by Ron Howard, was approved for public screening in 2006, in spite of protests by the Roman Catholic Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pres Benigno Aquino III handpicked Mary Grace Poe Llamanzares as MTRCB chair. It was Grace Poe&rsquo;s first government position. From the start of 23 Oct 2010, Llamanzares took to heart her new job until she resigned on 1 Oct 2012, in preparation for her candidacy as senator. One of Grace Poe&rsquo;s first moves as chief of MTRCB was to meet with all the MTRCB employees, study all the past records of MTRCB, and dialogue with film producers and television heads, as well as with representatives of movie and television shows, the better to understand problems and to seek solutions. Under Poe&rsquo;s leadership, less punishments or penalties were meted out. Immediate punitive action was prevented because violators were first warned, and more informal and sympathetic dialogue between MTRCB and violating parties were held. She introduced the classification rating of R-16 for the movies, and Strong Parental Guidance (SPG) for television. She supported independent filmmakers and advocated the protection of children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Following in the footsteps of Grace Poe is Atty Eugenio H. Villareal. He replaced Poe on 28 Nov 2012. Aside from dialogue, the best practices that minimize penalties and punishments expanded to the creation of committees in order to strengthen advocacies. Seminars with the theme &ldquo;Matalinong Panonood ng Pamilya at Lipunan nina Juan at Juana,&rdquo; or MP, was conducted all over Metro Manila and the regions. Media literacy and MPs are meant to heighten the awareness of people about the ratings and classifications of MTRCB as well as the tasks or functions of the agency. Tie-ups and memoranda of agreement are signed between MTRCB and both government and nongovernment entities. In 2015, board members are busy with various committees, like committees on persons with disabilities, on family and children&rsquo;s rights, on gender sensitivity, and on senior citizens. Film showings for the board and staff are conducted, and the filmmakers are invited. Self-regulation is encouraged by letting the TV stations decide on their own if their show merits a G, a PG, or an SPG. Because of the additional programs and projects and the new character of the MTRCB, it has now been considered not just a review and classification agency but also a developmental institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Naturally, not everyone can be pleased. Some still fight for more freedom of expression and complete self-regulation, or abolition of the MTRCB; others opt for censorship of the old school. In the end, there are laws, and until the laws themselves are changed, citizens have to abide by them. This is not to say that there is no room for liberal interpretations and applications. For instance, the MTRCB still has, under Presidential Decree 1986, the authority to &ldquo;approve or disapprove, delete objectionable portions from and/or prohibit the showing of TV shows and movies.&rdquo; This censorship function is circumvented by letting the filmmakers themselves decide what scenes to retain or to cut in order to merit a certain desired rating. MTRCB values, ultimately, age appropriateness or the protection of children.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Lena S.

Cinema first came to the Philippines during the last days of Spanish colonial rule when there was no film censorship. During the first two decades of American rule, films imported from Europe and the United States (US) enjoyed unlimited freedom of exhibition. It was only when Filipinos started producing their own movies that some sectors of the community saw the need for measures to control moviemaking activities. This was presumably the result of a protest lodged by the Spanish community that resented the showing of a film by JulianManansala titled <b><i>Patria</i></b> <b><i>Amore </i></b>(Beloved Country), which, opened at the Palace Theater on 23 Jul 1929. What Manansala intended as a nationalist work was perceived by the Spaniards as a movie with &#x201C;anti-Spanish sentiments.&#x201D; The protesters filed a court injunction to stop the exhibition of the movie. An American-dominated board, however, denied the plea for an injunction. Nevertheless, the authorities had been alerted. Four months later, on 27 Nov 1929, the Philippine Legislature established the first censors body by approving &#x201C;An Act to Create a Board of Censorship for Motion Pictures and Define Its Functions.&#x201D;"

The film was found objectionable not only for its title, which the censors feared would infect the youth with &#x201C;certain subversive ideas,&#x201D; but also for the presentation of a priest in a villainous role; the use of a hypodermic, poison-laden injection as a murder weapon; and the courtship scenes between a boy and a girl who were both 10 years of age.

The elements of cinematography are lighting, which helps create drama, mystery, suspense, and humor; composition or the arrangement of people and objects within the frame; and <b>movement</b>, which includes the mobility of the camera to change a vantage point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>cinematographer</b>, also called the <b>director of photography</b> (DOP), works directly with the production crew or shooting unit in the setup of a particular scene. The DOP scrutinizes the set together with the director and instructs the camera operator where to position the camera. He or she tells the gaffer where to place the lights and how to adjust the lighting, runs an exposure meter over the faces of the actors, and peers through the contrast filter to check the relationship between light and shadow. When everything is set up, the DOP advises the director who then steps up to the camera to approve its setup. On the director&rsquo;s signal or call for &ldquo;Roll camera &hellip; action!&rdquo; the camera starts grinding, the actors perform until the director yells &ldquo;Cut!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early Filipino director-producers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a> and Jose Domingo Badilla were first of all highly competent professional photographers. Lighting then was basic illumination, merely to allow the camera to record images on film. But these pioneer filmmakers knew that cinematography was more than that. They knew the magic of the camera and lighting devices and followed their products to the laboratory, nursing the movie up to the projection room where it told its story on screen. Later, they learned to improvise to find solutions to problems of illumination and lack of proper lighting equipment.

Color was used only in dream sequences and big production numbers in musicals where it added to the spectacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first attempts of the major studios to shift to color in full-length films are seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Batalyon Trece</i></b> (13th Battalion), 1949; Premiere&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Lumang Bahay sa Gulod</i></b> (The Old House on the Cliff), 1949; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>The Big Broadcast</i></b>, 1962. The shift to color called for drastic changes in filming, and cinematographers had to subject themselves to a different orientation. During the early years of color production, the <b>costume movie</b> became very popular. The choice of material increased the cost of production, and emphasized costume and set design. LVN played a leading role in the production of such films as <b><i><strong>Prinsipe Amante</strong> </i></b> (Prince Amante), 1950; <b><i>Rodrigo de Villa</i></b>, 1952; <b><i>Dagohoy</i></b>, 1953; <b><i>Hawayana </i></b>(Hawaiian Girl), 1953; <b><i>Prinsipe Te&ntilde;oso </i></b>(Prince Te&ntilde;oso), 1954; <b><i>Medalyong Perlas </i></b>(Pearl Medallion), 1956; and <b><i>Casa Grande </i></b>(Mansion), 1958.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1930s to the 1950s, when the studio system was in vogue, most cinematographers were part of the regular studio personnel assigned to particular film units. Then, with the studio system broken, cinematographers parceled out their services to film producers and directors with whom they felt artistically compatible. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4243\">Mike Accion</a> worked with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V.

Profound technological changes in the craft have occurred since the 1990s with the introduction of digital technology. This new <b>digital cinematography</b> is even credited as one of the main catalysts for the surge of independent or &ldquo;indie&rdquo; films in the country, which began in the late 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as the mid-1980s, the Japanese electronics giant Sony began introducing high-definition cameras but it was met with little enthusiasm by consumers. However, in 1997, with the introduction of the Sony <span style=\"text-underline:none\">HDCAM</span> (high-definition camera) recorders and professional video cameras based on <span style=\"text-underline:none\">CCD</span> (charge-coupled device) technology, the idea, now re-branded as &ldquo;digital cinematography,&rdquo; began to attract the attention of filmmakers and cinematographers. Digital cinematography is the process of capturing <span style=\"text-underline:none\">movement</span> as <span style=\"text-underline:none\">digital video images</span>, as opposed to the traditional use of <span style=\"text-underline:none\">film stock</span>. This form of digital capture may occur on <span style=\"text-underline:none\">video tape</span>, <span style=\"text-underline:none\">hard disks</span>, <span style=\"text-underline:none\">flash memory</span>, or other media that can record digital data through the use of a <span style=\"text-underline:none\">digital video/film camera</span>. Most recently, even mobile phones and tablet PCs (personal computers) equipped with high-definition video cameras are being used to shoot moving images. The images in these high-definition cameras are so sharp that their overall quality already approximates that of celluloid film. Furthermore, digital video cameras are cheaper and therefore more accessible compared to film. The same applies with the ancillary tools that are compatible with digital video, such as nonlinear editing, digital sound design and mixing, and a host of other tools used for filmmaking and animation. Thus, with digital video, the cost of production became significantly lower compared to that of celluloid film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two of the pioneers of <b>digital film</b> in the Philippines are independent filmmakers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4622\">Jon Red</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4380\">Khavn de la Cruz</a>. When digital video was introduced in the mid-1990s, Red was among the first to use digital video for a full-length feature film. <b><i>Still Lives</i></b>, 1999, stars indie favorites <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4706\">Joel Torre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2804\">Nonie Buencamino</a>, Alan Paule, and Ynez Veneracion. It screened as an official selection in the 2000 Singapore International Film Festival.

With the arrival of the digital film, he wrote a manifesto titled &ldquo;Digital Dekalogo: A Manifesto for a Filmless Philippines,&rdquo; and posted it in his own website. Part of it reads: &ldquo;Digital film, with its qualities of mobility, flexibility, intimacy, and accessibility, is the apt medium for a Third World country like the Philippines &hellip; [T]he digital revolution has reduced the emphasis on technology and has reasserted the centrality of the filmmaker, the importance of the human condition over visual junk food&rdquo; (de la Cruz 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A few pre-digital cinematographers have successfully crossed over to digital filmmaking.

Lighting then was basic illumination, merely to allow the camera to record images on film. But these pioneer filmmakers knew that cinematography was more than that. They knew the magic of the camera and lighting devices and followed their products to the laboratory, nursing the movie up to the projection room where it told its story on screen. Later, they learned to improvise to find solutions to problems of illumination and lack of proper lighting equipment. They made use of available lighting, using sun reflections and even automobile headlights in place of kleig lights. It became increasingly necessary to compensate for the adverse effects of strong lights, which could melt a hairpin on a star&#x2019;s coiffure."

Furthermore, digital video cameras are cheaper and therefore more accessible compared to film. The same applies with the ancillary tools that are compatible with digital video, such as nonlinear editing, digital sound design and mixing, and a host of other tools used for filmmaking and animation.

These works are analyzed for qualities that validate them as art or for implications on the history and culture of the Filipino people as these are represented in cinema by producers, directors, and/or scriptwriters. On the other hand, <b>film scholarship</b>&mdash;a larger term&mdash;refers to writings that study various aspects of and matters related to film, including theory, poetics, history and tradition, production, film industry, economics, spectatorship, preservation, and technology. Types of scholarship include film criticism, historical studies, genre studies, representations, biographical studies and portraits, and annotated bibliographies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"criticism\" name=\"criticism\"></a>Film Criticism</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film criticism did not formally manifest itself until the 1960s, or about 40 years after the film industry was born. Previously, what appeared in popular magazines were occasional articles about the state of the industry and the creative personages who inhabited the world of Philippine cinema. A series of articles on Filipino directors by Delfin F. Gamboa appeared monthly, from Dec 1949 to Mar 1952, in the <b><i>Literary Song-Movie Magazine</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>LSM</i></b>)<i>. </i>Gamboa wrote on some 16 film directors, delving into their personal backgrounds, shedding light on the preparation for film work of each of his subjects. In the process, attention was focused on the talent and artistry of such directors as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4432\">Gregorio Fernandez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a>. In effect, the articles were able to draw for film researchers an early profile of the creative side of the film industry in the decade that was to see the first masterworks of Filipino filmmaking. In the same cast was Vicente R. Generoso&rsquo;s four-part piece titled &ldquo;Movies and Public Interest&rdquo; (<b><i>LSM</i></b>,<i> </i>Jan-Apr 1951), which castigated producers whose conservatism had prevented the full realization of the intellectual and artistic potential of Filipino filmmakers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5006\">T. D. Agcaoili</a> wrote articles in the same progressive vein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early 1960s marked the appearance for the first time in a learned journal, <b><i>Philippine Studies </i></b>(<b><i>PS</i></b>),<i> </i>of an article on Philippine movies. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Tagalog Film and the Logic of Irony&rdquo; (<b><i>PS</i></b>,<i> </i>Jan 1962) was a survey of a number of films produced in 1960 and 1961, intended to explain why many Tagalog films fail to project a sense of the complexity of their subject matter and theme. As an article published in a university-based journal, Lumbera&rsquo;s piece reached only a limited circle. It was in the second half of the decade that film criticism was to reach a broad audience when <b><i>The Manila Chronicle</i></b><i> </i>began printing the reviews of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4972\">Nestor U. Torre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>. A student of Torre, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a> was to claim the distinction of being the first reviewer to reach out to the masses when he became a reviewer for the <i>komiks </i>magazine <b><i>Pilipino Reporter</i></b><i> </i>in the early 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The proscription of writing that might be construed as hinting at protest or discontent over martial rule made available in 1972 and later newspaper space that used to be taken up by political news and commentary. Suddenly, film reviews were welcome in the culture section of leading Manila dailies. Critics who made their opinions matter through poised and well-informed views on current film outputs and on problems and prospects of the industry were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5211\">Petronilo Bn. Daroy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2872\">Pio de Castro III</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4416\">Justino N. Dormiendo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4470\">Mario A. Hernando</a>, Manuel S. Pichel, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>. With Torre, Cervantes, Lumbera, and del Mundo, they were to serve as the original nucleus of the society of critics that was to call itself <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a> (MPP) in 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino film criticism may be said to have started out on the back of a tradition best designated as &ldquo;humanist/literary.&rdquo; This tradition dominated local film criticism from the postwar years up to the 1970s, with critics schooled in the theories and concepts of literature and theater. Cinema was assessed mainly for its narrative value. Praise was reserved for movies that observed a sense of unity in plot, possessed credible characters, and maintained concern for logic and motivation. Critics sought out films that had themes that spoke the truth about social realities and commented on the human condition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Given the strict criteria of the humanist/literary critics, it was not surprising that only a handful of Filipino films&mdash;the best of Gerardo de Leon, Lamberto V. Avellana, Gregorio Fernandez, Manuel Conde, and Manuel Silos&mdash;would be acclaimed. In the classic works of these great filmmakers, the critics saw the repudiation of mainstream cinema&rsquo;s fixation for illogical plots and improbable stories. Ironically, however, the films that they disliked represented the majority of Filipino movies. And despite the disapproving reviews, these movies were the ones patronized by the public, thus signaling that literature as a frame of reference could not account for the aesthetic appeal of mainstream filmmaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Notions of unity and logic are characteristically Western concepts that doubtless cannot be expected in an industry accustomed to shooting films without scripts. Scenes are constantly being improvised so that narrative unity is all but impossible to achieve. Despite the realities in the industry, most critics tended to ignore the pertinence of these matters in assessing a film&rsquo;s worth or significance. In brief, films were usually judged as finished products rather than as results of a problematic process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The emergence in Europe in the late 1960s of <b>art cinema</b> as opposed to commercial filmmaking left a profound impression on a generation of Filipino students, some of whom went abroad to pursue graduate studies in film. At this time, critics in Europe and the United States had begun to refer to other areas of knowledge in seeking to explain a whole new generation of films that shunned traditional narrative structure in favor of more experimental approaches. The liberating influence of the French New Wave toward the late 1950s had opened new intellectual directions for both filmmakers and critics. Filmmaking was now seen as a vehicle for personal expression, with critics acknowledging directors as authors of their films. Linguistic and art theory began to assume the position of literary criticism as a point of departure for analysis that seeks to explain the aesthetics of film viewing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A neoformalist tradition of reviewing also emerged in the 1990s. Some young critics prescinded from concern with art and relevance toward re-evaluating the notion of form and meaning in cinema. This renewed interest in form allowed mainstream Filipino cinema to be appreciated for its accomplishment in visualization and montage, which had been overlooked for years due to the critical preoccupation with narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Cinema studies</b> has become a recognized area in academe. In this area, film theory tries to account for a number of cinematic tendencies by referring to disciplines with parallels in cinematic art. Thus, by the early 1990s, Russian formalism, Freudian psychoanalysis, Marxist criticism, semiology, structuralism, post-structuralism, and feminism had become part of Filipino critical discourse; queer theory followed in the mid-1990s. Two important developments in academe have also changed the landscape of Philippine film studies: postcolonial theory and cultural studies. <b>Postcolonial theory</b> investigates the workings of colonialism and its effects on colonized cultures; thus, it examines the relationship between the colonizing and the colonized cultures, a violent relationship marked by &ldquo;stories of contestation and &hellip; complicity&rdquo; (Gandhi 1998, 4-5). <b>Cultural studies</b> deals with &ldquo;literary and non-literary cultural productions and processes, all being counted as &lsquo;texts&rsquo; to be decoded,&rdquo; and treats &ldquo;cultural productions&rdquo; like film and advertisement as a signifying practice whose creation, interpretation, and dissemination as &ldquo;texts&rdquo; take part in a complex network of power relations and ideological/discursive contestations (Baldick 2008, 76).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this way have Filipino critics of the last decades begun to account for the enduring popularity of <i>komiks</i>-based melodramas, formula action films, and clich&eacute;d film farces among the mass audience. Critics nowadays highlight the fact that movies are not isolated phenomena; regardless of their form or quality, they can function as either representation or subversion, or both, of the dominant ideology in Philippine society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several books and publications gathered a wealth of critical film reviews and considerably augmented the amount of information on Filipino films and filmmakers in the 1980s. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/25/1334\"><strong>The Urian Anthology 1970-1979</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1983, edited by Nicanor G. Tiongson, assembled a selection of the more important essays and reviews by members of the MPP. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/25/1332\"><strong>Readings in Philippine Cinema</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1983, edited by Rafael Ma. Guerrero, is an anthology of 26 articles by film reviewers and feature writers timed to come out during the Manila International Film Festival. Critic Isagani Cruz compiled his reviews and articles in the book <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/25/1327\"><strong>Movie Times</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>1987, the first ever collection of critical writings by a Filipino film critic. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/25/1331\"><strong>Notes on Philippine Cinema</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4630\">Emmanuel A. Reyes</a>, 1989, consists of reviews and studies by the young critic who has grappled with the Filipino film as popular culture. In 1983, the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines instituted the Film Ratings Board (FRB), which awarded tax rebates of 50 percent and 25 percent to applicant film productions. The printed organ of the FRB, <b><i>Filipino Film Review</i></b>,<i> </i>contains the ratings of the board and views and comments by its members from the time the FRB began to function in January 1983 to the time it folded up in 1987 when the Marcos regime was dismantled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like the other fields of film scholarship discussed above, film criticism developed further in the 1990s. Critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4364\">Joel David</a> published three books in this decade. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/25/1328\"><b><i>The National Pastime: Contemporary Philippine Cinema</i></b></a>, 1990, he has put together over 50 reviews that make this collection a comprehensive guide to the films of the 1980s. <b><i>Fields of Vision: Critical Applications in Recent Philippine Cinema</i></b>, 1995, complements <b><i>National Pastime</i></b>, for its reviews of Filipino films of the 1980s until 1990, but also goes beyond it in its preoccupation with theory and its applicability to local cinema. <b><i>Wages of Cinema: Film in Philippine Perspective</i></b>, 1998, the most theoretical among the three, contains extensive discussion of various theories and concepts like structuralism and post-structuralism, auteur criticism, Foucaldian historiography, feminism, psychoanalysis, and postcolonial theory. Emmanuel Reyes&rsquo;s second book, <b><i>Malikhaing Pelikula: Mga Sanaysay tungkol sa Pelikulang Pilipino</i></b> (Creative Film: Essays on Philippine Cinema), 1996, contains essays on art film, an interview with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4243\">Mike Accion</a>, and Reyes&rsquo;s own screenplays for <b><i>Dreaming Filipinos</i></b>, 1992, and <b><i>Suwapings</i></b>, 1994.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5736\">Rolando B. Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s two related books deserve mention: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/25/1329\"><b><i>National/Transnational: Subject Formations and Media in and on the Philippines</i></b></a>, 2001, and <b><i>Contestable Nation-Space: Cinema, Cultural Politics, and Transnationalism in the Marcos-Brocka Philippines</i></b>, 2014. While the former is more theoretical (subject formation vis-&agrave;-vis transnationalism) and broader in scope (covering more topics like mail-order catalogues and Southeast Asian cinema), the latter sheds light on the complex relationship between cinema and nationhood through Brocka&rsquo;s films and how they critically engage with Marcosian politics. Jessica Zafra came out with a collection of her film reviews, <b><i>Twisted Flicks</i></b>, in 2003. Noel Vera collected his film reviews, essays, and interviews from 1994 to 2004 in <b><i>Critic after Dark: A Review of Philippine Cinema</i></b>, 2005. The book contains commentaries on the works of acclaimed directors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4250\">Tikoy Aguiluz</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4681\">Carlos Siguion-Reyna</a>. Another important work on Philippine film criticism is Bienvenido Lumbera&rsquo;s <b><i>Re-Viewing Filipino Cinema</i></b>, 2011. The book gathers together Lumbera&rsquo;s essays from the 1970s up to the early 21st century on film history and the various aspects of film study (film as commodity, as art, and as social commentary) as well as insightful reviews of now classic Filipino movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indeed, from the 1970s onward, film criticism has grown in terms of quality and output. The country can now boast of generations of <b>film critics</b>. In the 1970s, the critics who at one point became members of MPP included Petronilo Bn. Daroy, Pio de Castro III, Justino N. Dormiendo, Mario A. Hernando, Manuel S. Pichel, Nicanor G. Tiongson, Nestor U.

Rapatan, Rolando B. Tolentino, Paul Daza, Joselito B. Zulueta, and Ellen Paglinauan joined MPP. In the first decade of the 21st century, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5685\">Benilda S.

The MPP&rsquo;s annual Gawad Urian recognized outstanding films, performances, and technical achievements within a given year. It was to become a much-prized award in the industry because it was reputed to be the result of careful deliberation by the members of the group, free from any form of industry pressure or influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4740\">Film Desk of the Young Critics Circle (YCC)</a> included Patrick Flores, Mike Feria, Ariel Valera, Flaudette May Datuin, Nonoy L.

Film buffs can publish their short comments on or reviews of films in their blog, Facebook account, or other social media sites. Filipino moviegoers can visit <b><i>Pinoy Rebyu: Pinoy Films through Pinoy Lenses</i></b>&mdash;the local equivalent of <b><i>Rotten Tomatoes</i></b>&mdash;to access reviews of Philippine movies by film enthusiasts and bona fide critics. At present, the websites of MPP and YCC complement their anthologies and contain insightful reviews of Filipino films, thereby promoting the intelligent appreciation of movies in the country. Magazines that have published film reviews and articles include <b><i>Movement </i></b>of Mowelfund, <b><i>Pelikula</i></b> of the UP College of Mass Communication, and <b><i>Sinekultura</i></b> of the University of San Carlos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"scholarship\" name=\"scholarship\"></a>Film Scholarship</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film studies has continued to grow from the 1990s onward. For film history, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP) released a series of monographs on Philippine cinema called <b><i>Pelikula</i></b>, which was accompanied by videos on various art forms as part of the series <b><i>Tuklas Sining</i> </b>(Discovering Art). These included Bienvenido Lumbera&rsquo;s overview monograph <b><i>Pelikula: An Essay on Philippine Film, 1989</i></b>; Agustin L. Sotto&rsquo;s <b><i>An Essay on the Philippine Film, 1897-1960</i></b>, 1992; Lumbera&rsquo;s <b><i>An Essay on the Philippine Film, 1961-1992</i></b>, 1992; and Nestor U. Torre&rsquo;s <b><i>An Essay on Philippine Film: Touchstones of Excellence</i></b>, 1994.

All these aforementioned works are grounded in postcolonial theory. Eloisa May P. Hernandez&rsquo;s <b><i>Digital Cinema in the Philippines, 1999-2009</i></b>, 2014, chronicles the history of digital cinema in the country, discusses its production as well as distribution and exhibition, and provides notes on its &ldquo;aesthetic tendencies&rdquo; (xiii). Nick Deocampo&rsquo;s <b><i>Films from a &ldquo;Lost&rdquo; Cinema</i></b> presents a history of the Cebuano films, using previous studies by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5517\">Resil Mojares</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5021\">Erlinda Alburo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The most extensive work on individual canonical directors so far is Nicanor G.

Previously, what appeared in popular magazines were occasional articles about the state of the industry and the creative personages who inhabited the world of Philippine cinema. A series of articles on Filipino directors by Delfin F. Gamboa appeared monthly, from Dec 1949 to Mar 1952, in the <b><i>Literary Song-Movie Magazine</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>LSM</i></b>)<i>. </i>Gamboa wrote on some 16 film directors, delving into their personal backgrounds, shedding light on the preparation for film work of each of his subjects. In the process, attention was focused on the talent and artistry of such directors as <a href=\"/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4432\">Gregorio Fernandez</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V.

In effect, the articles were able to draw for film researchers an early profile of the creative side of the film industry in the decade that was to see the first masterworks of Filipino filmmaking. In the same cast was Vicente R. Generoso&#x2019;s four-part piece titled &#x201C;Movies and Public Interest&#x201D; (<b><i>LSM</i></b>,<i> </i>Jan-Apr 1951), which castigated producers whose conservatism had prevented the full realization of the intellectual and artistic potential of Filipino filmmakers. <a href=\"/9/80/5006\">T. D. Agcaoili</a> wrote articles in the same progressive vein."

Cinema was assessed mainly for its narrative value.

In the classic works of these great filmmakers, the critics saw the repudiation of mainstream cinema&#x2019;s fixation for illogical plots and improbable stories. Ironically, however, the films that they disliked represented the majority of Filipino movies. And despite the disapproving reviews, these movies were the ones patronized by the public, thus signaling that literature as a frame of reference could not account for the aesthetic appeal of mainstream filmmaking."

The liberating influence of the French New Wave toward the late 1950s had opened new intellectual directions for both filmmakers and critics. Filmmaking was now seen as a vehicle for personal expression, with critics acknowledging directors as authors of their films.

Two important developments in academe have also changed the landscape of Philippine film studies: postcolonial theory and cultural studies. <b>Postcolonial theory</b> investigates the workings of colonialism and its effects on colonized cultures; thus, it examines the relationship between the colonizing and the colonized cultures, a violent relationship marked by &#x201C;stories of contestation and &#x2026; complicity&#x201D; (Gandhi 1998, 4-5). <b>Cultural studies</b> deals with &#x201C;literary and non-literary cultural productions and processes, all being counted as &#x2018;texts&#x2019; to be decoded,&#x201D; and treats &#x201C;cultural productions&#x201D; like film and advertisement as a signifying practice whose creation, interpretation, and dissemination as &#x201C;texts&#x201D; take part in a complex network of power relations and ideological/discursive contestations (Baldick 2008, 76)."

In 1983, the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines instituted the Film Ratings Board (FRB), which awarded tax rebates of 50 percent and 25 percent to applicant film productions. The printed organ of the FRB, <b><i>Filipino Film Review</i></b>,<i> </i>contains the ratings of the board and views and comments by its members from the time the FRB began to function in January 1983 to the time it folded up in 1987 when the Marcos regime was dismantled."

While these three functions still apply, <b>digital technologies</b> have allowed these tasks to happen simultaneously due to the speed, efficiency, and portability of digital data and technologies (Ohanian and Phillips 2000, 22).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"preproduction\" name=\"preproduction\"></a>Preproduction</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Digital technology made its entry into filmmaking through preproduction. The earliest forms of word processing software and platforms enabled screenwriters to turn story lines into scripts quickly and efficiently. Digital files allowed for multiple versions and easily integrated revisions; printouts and copies could also be made quickly and distributed on set to actors or to crew members.

Pre-visualization, aka &ldquo;previz,&rdquo; is a cinematic process used by filmmakers to preview a film well in advance of principal photography (Olsen 2010). A previz is a rough preview of the film before it is actually shot or produced. The most basic and simplest previz<i> </i>technique is the storyboard, but advanced previz goes far beyond the traditional storyboard; it covers a range that may include low-resolution edits, animated storyboards to pre-recorded dialogue, or &ldquo;one-light&rdquo; color correction to actual shot footage. The relatively low cost and speed of digital techniques now allow filmmakers to bring film ideas to life prior to committing money and resources into the main production (Ferster 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is now common for filmmakers to shoot low-resolution versions of a scene to determine if a camera technique or style will work. A composer can add a study of the music while costume designers can see how movements will be affected by the actors&rsquo; clothing.

Manufacturers like Sony, Panasonic, Arri, and Red have been at the forefront of defining the cutting edge of digital imaging technology for film. Further developments in imaging chip technology&mdash;at the heart of digital cameras&mdash;have also brought about cheaper, lower-end, but no less capable, cameras that have become accessible to professional consumers (&ldquo;prosumers&rdquo;), small production houses, and independent filmmakers. Canon C-Series and Blackmagic Cinema Cameras are professional-grade cameras at the fraction of the cost of an Arri or Red system; while Canon, Nikon, and Sony digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras&mdash;the same ones used in photography&mdash;have introduced more robust video capabilities. DSLRs, in particular, have revolutionized and democratized digital filmmaking with its low cost, simple technology, familiar form factor, and high photographic quality, opening up digital filmmaking to small independent producers, hobbyists, enthusiastic amateurs, and students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Coupled with innovations in imaging chips and camera technology are advances in recording and storage media. Early digital data used to be recorded on magnetic tape (analog) as digital data. The evolution of faster hard drives gave birth to tape-less digital video; with the advent of solid state storage formats, data transfer and recording rates have been able to keep up with the increasing resolution of cameras and resulting increase in data size. Today, solid-state drives can record hours of high-definition video data in packages no larger than a deck of playing cards, with consumer and prosumer cameras recording on high-capacity memory cards the size of a postage stamp (SD card) or human thumbnail (micro SD). The economic considerations are significant as well&mdash;digital storage is cheaper than 16 mm or 35 mm film stock and is reusable (Fair 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The combination of developments in camera and storage technology has brought about the evolution of a new key member in principal photography, the <b>digital imaging technician</b> (DIT). The primary role of the DIT is to act as data wrangler for the production&mdash;securing, logging, and making multiple backups of raw data footage from the cameras. Beyond making backups, though, the DIT is a crucial liaison between the camera department and postproduction. The DIT makes adjustments to camera and footage settings, such as aperture, ISO, or aspect ratio, based on the cinematographer&rsquo;s visual design and the director&rsquo;s final shot objective. The DIT must also coordinate footage with postproduction in anticipation of color-grading plans, visual effects, or workflow processes (Asbury 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">High-grade professional cameras, such as the Red, Arri, Canon C-Series, and Blackmagic Cinema Camera, record raw, untreated image data intended for color correction in postproduction; the result is usually a flat, washed-out image straight from the camera. On set, the DIT may provide a &ldquo;one-light&rdquo; color correction for the cinematographer, director, and, in the case of advertising or commercial projects, the client to simulate how the image might look like after postproduction (Asbury 2013). In a sense, the DIT provides a previsualization of the postproduction color correction process while the footage is being shot to allow for corrections or adjustments before the footage gets sent to the studio for postproduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"postproduction\" name=\"postproduction\"></a>Postproduction</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Digital filmmaking came to prominence in postproduction.<b> </b>Nonlinear editing technology was what pushed postproduction to truly embrace digital. <b>Nonlinear editing</b> allows the editor to create nondestructive timelines of sequences and scenes without needing to follow a chronological or sequential methodology (Fair 2006). Nonlinear systems allow edits to be cut and re-cut, with multiple versions being saved or tried out, without any damage to the original footage. Developments in the software then allowed for easy compositing of additional elements, such as effects layers, text, and computer-generated imagery (CGI). <b>Synthespians</b>&mdash;&ldquo;synthetic thespians&rdquo;&mdash;or computer-generated actors and characters are now seamlessly integrated with virtual sets into the scene with real actors, with the audience hard-pressed to tell the real from computer-generated images (Ohanian and Phillips 2000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The power of digital postproduction technologies has also boosted the art of <b>color correction</b> and <b>color grading</b>. &ldquo;Color correction&rdquo; must be differentiated from &ldquo;color grading.&rdquo; In color correction, adjustments are made to affect contrast, color temperature, or color tone. Color grading is introducing changes to create a &ldquo;look&rdquo; for the film or a particular scene within it. These changes are localized, and color adjustments may vary across shots or even within a shot itself (Paramour Productions, n.d.; Gates 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Color grading is achieved by manipulating ranges, tolerances, and thresholds of a digital image&rsquo;s red, green, and blue pixel channels. Other parameters a colorist can manipulate include the hue, saturation, and brightness, as well as contrast, highlights, midtones, and shadows. Utilizing layers and masking functions in color grading software, a colorist is able to manipulate specific areas of a shot to change or shift its visual mood, design, or aesthetic (Gates 2013). Color-graded footage is then sent back to the editor for finalization in the edit and eventual production of the release copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"future\" name=\"future\"></a>The Future</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Digital technologies have changed the world, and the world of cinema and filmmaking most significantly. Creative tools that were once impossible or too expensive have become commonplace and more accessible to the average artist, making available to consumers a wider and more varied range of products, and opening up the industry to new paradigms of business, creativity, and market forces.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">As the unifying force in the making of a film, the <b>director</b> controls the style, content, and overall form of the movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Philippines, the director usually acquires his skills through apprenticeship and actual participation in the filmmaking process, and/or through formal schooling. Reading film books may help, but the best training is still the hands-on experience of working in the industry itself. <b>Assistant directors</b>, <b>actors</b>, <b>cinematographers</b>, <b>scriptwriters</b>, <b>editors</b>, and <b>set designers</b> may eventually become directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The principal work of the director is to realize the vision that will bind the elements of film in one work of art. The director literally leads, guiding his screenwriter, cinematographer, actors, production designer, editor, musical director, sound engineer, and even his special effects supervisor to bring together what he envisions as his film. Therefore, the effectiveness of a director is not only measured by his technical skills or the significance of what he has to say. A good director is one who manages to draw out the best from everyone who forms part of his creative and technical team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once the script is ready to be translated into a motion picture, it is the director who assumes control over the film&rsquo;s form and content. Occasionally, established scriptwriters like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4510\">Ricky Lee</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose Lacaba</a> may insist that any essential changes in the script should be made by them or, at least, should merit their approval.

Five general styles may be identified, which may in turn be employed in varying ways. First, directors may work closely with the actors, instructing them directly as to movement, facial expressions, inner feelings, and delivery of dialogue without necessarily explaining the purpose of the direction. Second, directors may discuss the character and ideas of the film so that the actors will have a more definite concept of the role assigned to them. In effect, a kind of creative collaboration between director and actor takes place, a collaboration that will enable the actor to understand the director&rsquo;s interpretation of the film and its characters. Third, directors may leave the actors to their own devices, as the directors concentrate their efforts on the technical aspects of filmmaking.

They usually view the rushes with the editor and set the mood and tone that will guide the editing process. Having already influenced the editing by selecting only certain takes of each scene to be printed, directors move into the editing room and, in effect, control the creative destiny of the film. If the rough cut or first draft of the film does not match the directors&rsquo; image, it will be recut until it conforms to that image. Contemporary filmmakers recreate a film in the editing room as they created it on the set, applying all the necessary cures whenever possible.

In the 1930s, with the rise of large film studios like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>, Excelsior, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, the role of the director was subsumed under a compartmentalized and more specialized system. The studios hired, maintained, and supervised the actors, writers, editors, and directors.

The director becomes answerable to an executive or a committee who becomes the voice of the producer in determining the direction they want the movie to follow.</span>"

It is a critical point in the revenue-generating stream of film production. <b>Booking</b> and <b>exhibition</b> are the major stages of this process. Booking means getting the venues and the most profitable playdates for film exhibition ahead of time. Exhibition is the actual showing or presentation of the film to its audience. The theater owner, operator, or manager is also called the <b>exhibitor</b> of the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Films were first exhibited in Manila during the last years of Spanish colonial rule in the Philippines. The earliest account was in a Spanish-language newspaper, announcing an exhibition titled <b><i>Espectaculo Cientifico</i></b><i> </i>(Science Show), comprising seven titles, and shown in a converted warehouse on Escolta, Manila. The event, probably the first clear indication of a local film screening, was held on the first day of 1897, a little over a year since the first public showing of Cin&eacute;matographe films by the Lumi&egrave;re brothers in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early accounts also point to a Frenchman named Rebarber who, with Eduardo Munarriz and Jose Hernandez as capitalists and Jose Martin as projectionist, took over an old warehouse at the back of Quiapo Church on Evangelista Street and converted it into a cinema, Cine Orpheum, in 1904. Another warehouse on Ongpin Street near Misericordia Street in Santa Cruz, Manila, was made into a movie house called Cine Cervantes. In 1907, a row of <i>accesoria </i>(apartments) along Legarda Street in Sampaloc, Manila, owned by Dr Valentin Guidote (whose daughter, Raymunda Guidote, later appeared in a silent film, <b><i>Fate or Consequence</i></b>,<i> </i>1926), was transformed into Cine Moderno. The next year, 1908, saw the construction of Ideal Theater on Rizal Avenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first Filipino feature films that were shown at the Grand Opera House and at the Empire and Majestic theaters were relatively short. Albert Yearsley&rsquo;s <b><i>El Fusilamiento de</i></b> <b><i>Dr.  <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </i></b><i> </i>(The Execution of Dr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>), 1912, had a screening time of only 20 minutes, while Edward Gross&rsquo;s <b><i>La Vida de</i></b> <b><i>Jose Rizal</i></b><i> </i>(The Life of Jose Rizal), 1912, came as the standard four-reeler of approximately 5,000 feet with a screening time of almost one hour (one reel of film took about 12 minutes to run in the silent movie projector).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the coming of talking pictures, feature films increased in length. The standard was one-and-a-half to two hours of screening time. Films came in 2,000-foot reels and were shuttled among nearby theaters during multiple first-run exhibitions in Metro Manila. The practice was called <b>lagare</b>&mdash;literally, &ldquo;sawing.&rdquo; This practice guaranteed the simultaneous exhibition of one film in several theaters using only one available print copy. While the lagare system was accepted in the city so as to cut on costs (producers found it too expensive to provide each theater with its own print copy), the unauthorized exhibition system in the provinces known as <b>bisikleta </b>(literally, &ldquo;bicycle,&rdquo; referring to the vehicle that was used for transporting the film to a venue not contracted by the producer) was condemned by film distributors and film producers alike. Film checkers who were caught conspiring with unscrupulous exhibitors in the bisikleta system were heavily penalized if not fired outright, while erring theaters were boycotted and their supply of films cut off for a certain period by both the producers&rsquo; associations (the Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association and the Integrated Movie Producers, Importers, and Distributors Association of the Philippines) and the exhibitors&rsquo; associations (the Greater Manila Theaters Association and the Metro Manila Theaters Association).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the past, <b>block booking</b> required an exhibitor to take the full package of films or receive none of a studio&rsquo;s offerings. In order to buy a studio&rsquo;s products, the exhibitor was asked to purchase&mdash;sight unseen&mdash;a full year&rsquo;s program of film features. This resulted in a kind of assembly-line production of films because producers were forced to provide films to the exhibitor on time at all costs. Block booking thrived only in a setup where there was an assured supply of films for a corresponding circuit or chain of exhibitors. This practice was prevalent in the 1950s when the Big Four studios (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4508\">Lebran</a>) were bound by block booking arrangements made with the exhibitors of Life and Dalisay theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mayor Antonio Villegas, the acknowledged father of local film festivals, contributed to the breakthrough of Tagalog movies into the &ldquo;English theaters&rdquo; in downtown Manila, particularly Avenida Rizal. At that time, the only movie houses showing Tagalog films on a regular first-run basis were Life and Dalisay theaters and, occasionally, Center Theater in Quiapo. All other first-run theaters were then tied up to the exhibition of American films: the Ideal Theater for MGM, Universal for Udia Films, Avenue for Warner Bros., Ever for 20th Century Fox, State for Columbia Pictures, and so on. Mayor Villegas initiated the annual Manila Film Festival in 1966 and this festival popularized Tagalog films, thus convincing theater owners that these were marketable and profitable. In 1975, the filmfest was expanded to include theaters and areas outside Manila and was renamed Metropolitan Film Festival, which became Metro Manila Film Festival in 1977.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Tagalog movies were able to penetrate the movie houses showing only films in English, producers who made only a few good pictures a year made the best of the situation through <b>lockout booking</b>. Under this system, a producer books a film for a certain period. For a motion picture with famous stars, a producer would be assured two weeks of continuous booking while an ordinary movie was given only one week or less. Regardless of how the movie fared at the <b>box office</b> (an exhibition term derived from the box-shaped booth where moviegoers paid to get their tickets), the exhibition went on uninterrupted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>holdover system</b>, on the other hand, did not guarantee producers a definite period of showing for their films. Continued showing of a film was guaranteed only for as long as the film reached the holdover figure. This was the minimum amount of daily gross receipts set by the exhibitor as a &ldquo;break-even&rdquo; point. When the receipts fell below this figure, the film was withdrawn from exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gross receipts at the box office were shared by exhibitor and producer after taxes were paid to the government. There were two ways of sharing the proceeds: through the <b>sliding scale</b> <b>system</b> or the <b>fixed percentage system</b>. In the sliding scale system, a producer shared, net of tax, between 40 percent and 65 percent of the gross depending on the income at the box office&mdash;the bigger the receipts, the higher the rate for the producer. Under the fixed percentage system, theater owners and producers agreed on a fixed ratio (50:50, 55:45, or 60:40) regardless of the amount received from the box office. A daily box-office report on the hourly income from ticket sales was filled out and signed by the film checker or the representative of the film producer, and confirmed by the theater management. This report indicated how income was to be shared between the film owner and the exhibitor, as well as the amount of taxes to be paid to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film exhibition in the Philippines follows a course, a series of events designed to draw the full patronage of particular groups of moviegoers. The ehibition of a good film usually starts with a good press preview, which has the twofold purpose of marketing the film as well as testing the response of critics, evaluators, movie journalists, and other influential persons who are in a position to spread the good word about the film. Next is the premiere night, when the film officially debuts to a prominent paying public, usually at higher prices. Sometimes this is sponsored by entities, such as the Red Cross or the Catholic Women&rsquo;s League, which are themselves the beneficiaries of tax proceeds from the film. This is followed by the first-run exhibition of the film, still at premium theaters, though not as large and elegant as the &ldquo;film palaces&rdquo; reserved for premieres. Tickets for regular first-run screenings are more affordable than premiere tickets. In recent years, the trend for first-run exhibition has shifted from the big theaters or movie houses to the multicinema complexes in supermarket centers and shopping malls like the Ayala Malls Cinemas and the SM Cinemas in Metro Manila. After some time has elapsed, the film is exhibited on its second-run engagement, this time in a larger number of theaters, accompanied by another picture as a double feature. Lastly, there are the provincial screenings, with the film prints circulating all over the country, from the cities to the towns and municipalities. Some of these provincial exhibitions are held simultaneously on a first-run basis with theater openings in Metro Manila. Occasionally, there are &ldquo;roadshow&rdquo; engagements, which precede the first-run regular showings at prices higher than first-run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other more specialized forms of exhibition are the open-air screenings occasionally held at the Rizal Park in Manila and which in rural areas without theaters are usually done in line with product promotions or political campaigns; campus previews in university auditoriums, which during the 1970s succeeded in promoting mainstream films regarded as artistic but &ldquo;uncommercial&rdquo;; the free-admission screenings of retrospectives, embassy films, and alternative (independent) cinema at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>; the school-based alternative and experimental film screenings at the UP Film Center, De La Salle University, and other venues, which expose students and faculty to other possibilities in film expression and messages; the screenings at the Manila Film Center, formerly run by the defunct Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, which in the 1980s sparked controversy because it was exempted from censorship and taxation; and the occasional carnival sideshows, featuring novelty presentations such as the 180-degree widescreen shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Up to the 1990s, the distribution of movies was simple and straightforward as it was only the movie theaters that were involved in the booking and exhibition of the finished film. There were only two distribution circuits that wielded tremendous powers on the booking and distribution of films: the Metro Manila Theaters Association and the Greater Manila Theaters Association. After the 1990s, major changes in the distribution practices began when many venues, other than the stand-alone movie theater, were opened for the screening of films. All these vehicles became possible sources of revenue for the producers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The advent of the shopping mall in the 1970s and 1980s created the venue where majority of the film audience congregate. The comfort of air-conditioned and easily accessible malls provided the public with a one-stop place for shopping, entertainment, and commercial and personal services. The construction of malls in every major city and town saw the mushrooming of the <b>cineplex</b>. A cineplex may have anywhere from 4 to 12 theaters. The current listing of theaters shows 706 theaters or screens that are located in cineplexes inside malls and supermalls. The Ayala Group Corporation has 67 theaters in its malls and accounts for 9.5 percent of all theaters. The Cinema 2000 Theater Group has 111 theaters and accounts for 15.7 percent of all theaters. Robinsons has 127 theaters and accounts for 18 percent of all theaters. The SM Group has 296 theaters and accounts for 42 percent of all theaters. There are 105 more screens under different companies and groups that account for 14.8 percent of all theaters. Stand-alone theaters or movie houses that are separate and unique structures are a thing of the past. Only a few exist now and are insignificant in terms of distribution statistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A major motion picture often plays at these commercial theaters. After the theatrical release, films are shown on TV and eventually released in the home video consumption market via DVD, Blu-ray and online streaming. Nowadays, the theater-to-home window has been shortened to maximize profit potential in the quickest time possible. There is also <b>video on demand</b> or VOD, which may show a film to the home market concurrently with a theatrical release.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A major factor that influences the distribution system is the proliferation of independently produced movies made outside the major film studios beginning in the 2000s. In no other period in Philippine cinema has there been such an explosion of works with varied visions, styles, and social functions as the one brought about by independent or indie filmmakers. The ascendance of independent films with low budgets brought about new and different ways of distributing and exhibiting films. Self-produced, crowd-funded, or micro-budget films may vary in the ways that the product is shown to the public. Some indie films travel the festival circuit for a couple of years to gain attention and, possibly, to attract a major studio or even a worldwide distribution company. There are foreign distribution agents who will represent a filmmaker and his/her company to broker the film to foreign film distribution outlets, often for a percentage of the sale price plus expenses and fees. Depending on these agents&rsquo; connections and the overall budget of the film being represented, this may or may not be an option for the filmmaker. Sometimes, services like Netflix or iTunes will not accept a submission without the provision of representation. It should be noted that there are platforms online that allow filmmakers to sell virtual tickets to screen their films and keep a certain percentage of the &ldquo;ticket price.&rdquo; So, distribution can range from the more traditional route like commercial theaters to the current online platforms like YouTube and Vimeo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Whether a film is produced by a major studio or is independently produced outside the mainstream of the industry, the following sources of revenue continue to be relevant. First are <b>theater ticket sales</b>. The primary way that movies, particularly mainstream movies, make money is through theater ticket sales. While there are exceptions (such as movies that are transferred directly to DVD after a failure to attract a commercial theater exhibition), the average movie is going to make its income from ticket sales in the local movie cineplexes. A second source of revenue is <b>DVD sales</b>. While a movie studio might only make a few pesos from each DVD sale, the number quickly adds up with the sale of hundreds or thousands of DVDs. Third is <b>free television </b>and<b> cable</b>. When a movie is negotiated for showing on free television or cable, the movie company can either sell the rights to the movie for a number of years or even for perpetuity, or get a flat fee for a specified number of screenings of the movie per year, or get a percentage of the commercials. Many consider television the best kind of residual payout for a movie. Fourth source of income is video on demand.<b> </b>When a movie is ordered on the Internet or other means via VOD, the movie company either takes a percentage of the sale or may have already been paid a flat fee for distribution via VOD. Fifth, income is generated from <b>school tours </b>and<b> special screenings</b>. What is possibly saving many independent film producers today are the residual revenues provided by school screenings made in cooperation with the different school organizations. Students are usually required to watch a particular movie as part of the school requirement for a particular subject. Special screenings by civic and private groups and sponsors add to the revenue of an independently produced movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The problem of film distribution finally has to do with earnings and revenues. Producers and exhibitors alike bewail the fact that a large percentage of box-office receipts go to the government as taxes. Government support in terms of less taxation and more incentives, they maintain, can have a great effect in sustaining the movie industry. The advance or simultaneous release of unauthorized or pirated videos of Filipino films on the black market has greatly reduced the local film audience. To counter the practice, the Anti-Film Piracy Board was established by exhibitors and producers in 1984. Currently, the piracy board is one of the boards and councils that assist the Optical Media Board, established in 2004.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\"><strong>Rosalie Matilac</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4364\"><strong>Joel David</strong></a>, with notes from&nbsp;</strong> </em><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2872\">Pio de Castro III</a></em></strong> <em><strong>, </strong> </em><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a></em></strong> <em><strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

Regardless of how the movie fared at the <b>box office</b> (an exhibition term derived from the box-shaped booth where moviegoers paid to get their tickets), the exhibition went on uninterrupted."

Continued showing of a film was guaranteed only for as long as the film reached the holdover figure.

There were two ways of sharing the proceeds: through the <b>sliding scale</b> <b>system</b> or the <b>fixed percentage system</b>. In the sliding scale system, a producer shared, net of tax, between 40 percent and 65 percent of the gross depending on the income at the box office&#x2014;the bigger the receipts, the higher the rate for the producer. Under the fixed percentage system, theater owners and producers agreed on a fixed ratio (50:50, 55:45, or 60:40) regardless of the amount received from the box office. A daily box-office report on the hourly income from ticket sales was filled out and signed by the film checker or the representative of the film producer, and confirmed by the theater management. This report indicated how income was to be shared between the film owner and the exhibitor, as well as the amount of taxes to be paid to the government."

				"value": "Film exhibition in the Philippines follows a course, a series of events designed to draw the full patronage of particular groups of moviegoers. The ehibition of a good film usually starts with a good press preview, which has the twofold purpose of marketing the film as well as testing the response of critics, evaluators, movie journalists, and other influential persons who are in a position to spread the good word about the film. Next is the premiere night, when the film officially debuts to a prominent paying public, usually at higher prices. Sometimes this is sponsored by entities, such as the Red Cross or the Catholic Women&#x2019;s League, which are themselves the beneficiaries of tax proceeds from the film. This is followed by the first-run exhibition of the film, still at premium theaters, though not as large and elegant as the &#x201C;film palaces&#x201D; reserved for premieres. Tickets for regular first-run screenings are more affordable than premiere tickets. In recent years, the trend for first-run exhibition has shifted from the big theaters or movie houses to the multicinema complexes in supermarket centers and shopping malls like the Ayala Malls Cinemas and the SM Cinemas in Metro Manila. After some time has elapsed, the film is exhibited on its second-run engagement, this time in a larger number of theaters, accompanied by another picture as a double feature. Lastly, there are the provincial screenings, with the film prints circulating all over the country, from the cities to the towns and municipalities. Some of these provincial exhibitions are held simultaneously on a first-run basis with theater openings in Metro Manila. Occasionally, there are &#x201C;roadshow&#x201D; engagements, which precede the first-run regular showings at prices higher than first-run."

				"value": "Other more specialized forms of exhibition are the open-air screenings occasionally held at the Rizal Park in Manila and which in rural areas without theaters are usually done in line with product promotions or political campaigns; campus previews in university auditoriums, which during the 1970s succeeded in promoting mainstream films regarded as artistic but &#x201C;uncommercial&#x201D;; the free-admission screenings of retrospectives, embassy films, and alternative (independent) cinema at the <a href=\"/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>; the school-based alternative and experimental film screenings at the UP Film Center, De La Salle University, and other venues, which expose students and faculty to other possibilities in film expression and messages; the screenings at the Manila Film Center, formerly run by the defunct Experimental Cinema of the Philippines, which in the 1980s sparked controversy because it was exempted from censorship and taxation; and the occasional carnival sideshows, featuring novelty presentations such as the 180-degree widescreen shows."

				"value": "Up to the 1990s, the distribution of movies was simple and straightforward as it was only the movie theaters that were involved in the booking and exhibition of the finished film. There were only two distribution circuits that wielded tremendous powers on the booking and distribution of films: the Metro Manila Theaters Association and the Greater Manila Theaters Association. After the 1990s, major changes in the distribution practices began when many venues, other than the stand-alone movie theater, were opened for the screening of films. All these vehicles became possible sources of revenue for the producers."

The comfort of air-conditioned and easily accessible malls provided the public with a one-stop place for shopping, entertainment, and commercial and personal services. The construction of malls in every major city and town saw the mushrooming of the <b>cineplex</b>. A cineplex may have anywhere from 4 to 12 theaters. The current listing of theaters shows 706 theaters or screens that are located in cineplexes inside malls and supermalls. The Ayala Group Corporation has 67 theaters in its malls and accounts for 9.5 percent of all theaters. The Cinema 2000 Theater Group has 111 theaters and accounts for 15.7 percent of all theaters. Robinsons has 127 theaters and accounts for 18 percent of all theaters. The SM Group has 296 theaters and accounts for 42 percent of all theaters. There are 105 more screens under different companies and groups that account for 14.8 percent of all theaters. Stand-alone theaters or movie houses that are separate and unique structures are a thing of the past. Only a few exist now and are insignificant in terms of distribution statistics."

After the theatrical release, films are shown on TV and eventually released in the home video consumption market via DVD, Blu-ray and online streaming.

There is also <b>video on demand</b> or VOD, which may show a film to the home market concurrently with a theatrical release."

				"value": "A major factor that influences the distribution system is the proliferation of independently produced movies made outside the major film studios beginning in the 2000s. In no other period in Philippine cinema has there been such an explosion of works with varied visions, styles, and social functions as the one brought about by independent or indie filmmakers. The ascendance of independent films with low budgets brought about new and different ways of distributing and exhibiting films. Self-produced, crowd-funded, or micro-budget films may vary in the ways that the product is shown to the public. Some indie films travel the festival circuit for a couple of years to gain attention and, possibly, to attract a major studio or even a worldwide distribution company. There are foreign distribution agents who will represent a filmmaker and his/her company to broker the film to foreign film distribution outlets, often for a percentage of the sale price plus expenses and fees. Depending on these agents&#x2019; connections and the overall budget of the film being represented, this may or may not be an option for the filmmaker. Sometimes, services like Netflix or iTunes will not accept a submission without the provision of representation. It should be noted that there are platforms online that allow filmmakers to sell virtual tickets to screen their films and keep a certain percentage of the &#x201C;ticket price.&#x201D; So, distribution can range from the more traditional route like commercial theaters to the current online platforms like YouTube and Vimeo."

				"value": "Whether a film is produced by a major studio or is independently produced outside the mainstream of the industry, the following sources of revenue continue to be relevant. First are <b>theater ticket sales</b>. The primary way that movies, particularly mainstream movies, make money is through theater ticket sales. While there are exceptions (such as movies that are transferred directly to DVD after a failure to attract a commercial theater exhibition), the average movie is going to make its income from ticket sales in the local movie cineplexes. A second source of revenue is <b>DVD sales</b>. While a movie studio might only make a few pesos from each DVD sale, the number quickly adds up with the sale of hundreds or thousands of DVDs. Third is <b>free television </b>and<b> cable</b>. When a movie is negotiated for showing on free television or cable, the movie company can either sell the rights to the movie for a number of years or even for perpetuity, or get a flat fee for a specified number of screenings of the movie per year, or get a percentage of the commercials. Many consider television the best kind of residual payout for a movie. Fourth source of income is video on demand.<b> </b>When a movie is ordered on the Internet or other means via VOD, the movie company either takes a percentage of the sale or may have already been paid a flat fee for distribution via VOD. Fifth, income is generated from <b>school tours </b>and<b> special screenings</b>. What is possibly saving many independent film producers today are the residual revenues provided by school screenings made in cooperation with the different school organizations. Students are usually required to watch a particular movie as part of the school requirement for a particular subject. Special screenings by civic and private groups and sponsors add to the revenue of an independently produced movie."

				"value": "The problem of film distribution finally has to do with earnings and revenues. Producers and exhibitors alike bewail the fact that a large percentage of box-office receipts go to the government as taxes. Government support in terms of less taxation and more incentives, they maintain, can have a great effect in sustaining the movie industry. The advance or simultaneous release of unauthorized or pirated videos of Filipino films on the black market has greatly reduced the local film audience. To counter the practice, the Anti-Film Piracy Board was established by exhibitors and producers in 1984. Currently, the piracy board is one of the boards and councils that assist the Optical Media Board, established in 2004.&#xA0;<span class>&#xA0;</span>  "

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Film editing</b> is the process of selecting, assembling, and arranging motion picture shots into a coherent film. It not only provides logical continuity but also creates pace and mood, compresses or expands time and space, and generally underlines the visual meanings of a film. Editing is an art as it requires the careful yet creative juxtaposition of images to coincide with what makes the most effective story. There is always the pacing of the film to consider as well as the arc and progression of important narrative units to make the story clear while at the same time interesting and new. There are times when the editor can completely give a new twist to the storytelling because of the sheer power of his ingenuity and grasp of how to tell a visual story in a unique way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are two basic categories of editing: simple editing that focuses on continuity from shot to shot, and the more creative and complex type of editing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The basic goal of editing is to give continuity and coherence to various shots by putting the film together through simple cutting or trimming and arranging the shots in sequence, following the order specified in the movie script. Before the advent of computer editing, scenes were cut and spliced with tape (dry splice) or film cement (wet splice). The best takes and camera angles were selected for the <b>rough cut</b>, which was the first stage of the edited <b>workprint</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The more creative aspect of editing is refining and reshaping the material by further trimming down to achieve the desired structure and rhythm. Before digital editing, editors worked on a machine called the Moviola or the horizontal flatbed editing console, carefully examining each scene to find out whether the shots were arranged and juxtaposed within scenes to create meaning, mood, or effect. Every scene was sharpened and compressed into a desired length and added to other scenes, composing a sequence. Transitional effects like fades, dissolves, and wipes were tentatively marked in the workprint by glaze pencil. The sequences were made to flow into one flawless continuity. Once the rough cut was approved, the rest of the work was done to its final version, the <b>fine cut</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The workprint became the basis for mixing in the separate sound tracks (dialogue, narration, sound effects, music, etc.) with the film&rsquo;s visuals. Transitional effects (dissolves, fades, etc.) and titles were also designated by the editor and properly marked on the workprint in preparation for optical printing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the last phase of editing, the workprint was turned over to a negative cutter who matched it using the edge numbers that correspond to the original negative, which had been carefully kept intact since the first shooting day. With extreme care, using white gloves and working in a dust-free cutting room, the negative cutter cut and spliced the negative exactly the way the workprint had been edited. The matched negative was then delivered to the film laboratory together with the sound negative produced by the optical printer from the mixed track. Specific instructions from the editor and the director accompanied the material.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The trial print that came back from the film laboratory was known as the <b>answer print</b>. It was screened and examined carefully during a preview on the big screen to correct light balance, color grading, and other optical details. The answer print was returned to the laboratory for correction and the process went on until a final print was approved. Subsequently, release prints were prepared and copied from the negative, and only then did the film editor complete his work on the film project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When filming no longer required negatives and positives&mdash;and digital technology took over&mdash;the work of the editor became easier as it also posed much greater demand in terms of creativity and innovation. Without the limitations of physical cutting and splicing of the workprint, the editor is now able to manipulate images more freely, stringing together various shots to tell a story with the luxury of easy revision while finding the best way to tell the story based on the available footage. Creativity in editing comes in reshaping the material and not merely putting together what has been laid out for the editor to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The advent of digital technology produced the <b>nonlinear editing system</b>. It uses a computer to arrange and play pictures and sounds, thereby simplifying the cutting of the film in terms of workload and efficiency. It is not merely a tool for cutting or rearranging shots, but it also has the capabilities to do visual effects, graphics, and sound editing in one setup. Shots can be changed or removed with the click of the mouse. The material is stored in the computer&rsquo;s hard drives. This provides an instant, random access to any part of the footage. Although digital editing seems to make film editing a lot easier and quicker, the main discipline of telling a story remains the same as in the traditional film editing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Like the practice in traditional filmmaking, the editor is given the<b> raw footage</b> of the movie in production. This footage is submitted for digitizing from a day or days of shooting. They are all the shots taken by the director and his cameraman to provide the raw material for the sequences taken for the day. These shots can be viewed by the producer and the director. Roughly edited footage gives a semblance of form beyond a series of shots and takes.<i> </i>Again, directors, producers, and even creative committees view the rough cut to see the progression of the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The editor is sometimes given the liberty to do the <b>editor&rsquo;s cut</b><i>.</i> This is how the editor decides to assemble the movie, but this version is subject to the critique and discrimination of the director. A director may choose to alter, adjust, or even make general revisions of the editor&rsquo;s cut to come out with his own <b>director&rsquo;s cut</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The director&rsquo;s cut is presented to the producer who can choose to accept or make revisions from what their commissioned filmmaker has offered them. If there are still changes or even tweaks needed, then the editor proceeds to do the <b>producer&rsquo;s cut</b>,<i> </i>which is often the <b>release copy</b><i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All these versions are rendered off-line. After the finalization of the release copy, the editor proceeds to do the online procedures in order for the film to be transferred to the digital cinema package or other formats required by movie houses or the various platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early days of the film industry in the Philippines, film editing was such a delicate task that directors and producers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4526\">Julian Manansala</a> could not entrust it to others; they themselves edited their own films. During the silent picture era when there was practically only one movie studio (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4524\">Malayan Movies</a>) servicing the needs of various film producers, directors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\">Carlos Vander Tolosa</a>, Jose Domingo Badilla, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a> packaged editing work in their contracts with movie producers, subsequently training and hiring cutters to do the elementary job of cutting and joining the materials so that they could devote more time to creative editing work. With the advent of the talking film or &ldquo;talkies,&rdquo; editing became a more complicated process, prompting Filipino film technicians to study under Hollywood-trained experts who were brought into the country with the new technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the rise of movie studios in the years immediately preceding the Pacific War, film editing as a profession came into its own. Every film studio had its own chief film editor supervising the work of an entire department staffed with film cutters and negative matchers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a> had Victoriano Calub; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\">Parlatone Hispano-Filipino Films</a>, Leandro German; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a>, Nario Rosales and Pedro Manlangit; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a>, Greg Carballo and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4482\">Enrique Jarlego Sr</a>; and X&rsquo;Otic Pictures, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4727\">Antonio Verches</a>, who later became a movie director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film editors who became directors themselves, aside from Verches, include Marcelino Navarro,<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4664\">Augusto Salvador</a>, Pepe Marcos, and Toto Natividad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Verches was the first film editor to receive an award from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS <strong>)</strong></a> for his work in <b><i>May Isang Tsuper ng Taxi</i></b><i> </i>(There Was a Taxi Driver), 1953.

Before the advent of computer editing, scenes were cut and spliced with tape (dry splice) or film cement (wet splice). The best takes and camera angles were selected for the <b>rough cut</b>, which was the first stage of the edited <b>workprint</b>."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The more creative aspect of editing is refining and reshaping the material by further trimming down to achieve the desired structure and rhythm. Before digital editing, editors worked on a machine called the Moviola or the horizontal flatbed editing console, carefully examining each scene to find out whether the shots were arranged and juxtaposed within scenes to create meaning, mood, or effect. Every scene was sharpened and compressed into a desired length and added to other scenes, composing a sequence. Transitional effects like fades, dissolves, and wipes were tentatively marked in the workprint by glaze pencil. The sequences were made to flow into one flawless continuity. Once the rough cut was approved, the rest of the work was done to its final version, the <b>fine cut</b>."

Transitional effects (dissolves, fades, etc.) and titles were also designated by the editor and properly marked on the workprint in preparation for optical printing."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In the last phase of editing, the workprint was turned over to a negative cutter who matched it using the edge numbers that correspond to the original negative, which had been carefully kept intact since the first shooting day. With extreme care, using white gloves and working in a dust-free cutting room, the negative cutter cut and spliced the negative exactly the way the workprint had been edited. The matched negative was then delivered to the film laboratory together with the sound negative produced by the optical printer from the mixed track. Specific instructions from the editor and the director accompanied the material."

				"type": "paragraph",

It was screened and examined carefully during a preview on the big screen to correct light balance, color grading, and other optical details. The answer print was returned to the laboratory for correction and the process went on until a final print was approved. Subsequently, release prints were prepared and copied from the negative, and only then did the film editor complete his work on the film project."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "When filming no longer required negatives and positives&#x2014;and digital technology took over&#x2014;the work of the editor became easier as it also posed much greater demand in terms of creativity and innovation. Without the limitations of physical cutting and splicing of the workprint, the editor is now able to manipulate images more freely, stringing together various shots to tell a story with the luxury of easy revision while finding the best way to tell the story based on the available footage. Creativity in editing comes in reshaping the material and not merely putting together what has been laid out for the editor to follow."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The advent of digital technology produced the <b>nonlinear editing system</b>. It uses a computer to arrange and play pictures and sounds, thereby simplifying the cutting of the film in terms of workload and efficiency. It is not merely a tool for cutting or rearranging shots, but it also has the capabilities to do visual effects, graphics, and sound editing in one setup. Shots can be changed or removed with the click of the mouse. The material is stored in the computer&#x2019;s hard drives. This provides an instant, random access to any part of the footage. Although digital editing seems to make film editing a lot easier and quicker, the main discipline of telling a story remains the same as in the traditional film editing."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Like the practice in traditional filmmaking, the editor is given the<b> raw footage</b> of the movie in production. This footage is submitted for digitizing from a day or days of shooting. They are all the shots taken by the director and his cameraman to provide the raw material for the sequences taken for the day. These shots can be viewed by the producer and the director. Roughly edited footage gives a semblance of form beyond a series of shots and takes.<i> </i>Again, directors, producers, and even creative committees view the rough cut to see the progression of the film."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The editor is sometimes given the liberty to do the <b>editor&#x2019;s cut</b><i>.</i> This is how the editor decides to assemble the movie, but this version is subject to the critique and discrimination of the director. A director may choose to alter, adjust, or even make general revisions of the editor&#x2019;s cut to come out with his own <b>director&#x2019;s cut</b>."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The director&#x2019;s cut is presented to the producer who can choose to accept or make revisions from what their commissioned filmmaker has offered them. If there are still changes or even tweaks needed, then the editor proceeds to do the <b>producer&#x2019;s cut</b>,<i> </i>which is often the <b>release copy</b><i>.</i>"
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "All these versions are rendered off-line. After the finalization of the release copy, the editor proceeds to do the online procedures in order for the film to be transferred to the digital cinema package or other formats required by movie houses or the various platforms."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In the early days of the film industry in the Philippines, film editing was such a delicate task that directors and producers like <a href=\"/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a>, and <a href=\"/4/26/4526\">Julian Manansala</a> could not entrust it to others; they themselves edited their own films. During the silent picture era when there was practically only one movie studio (<a href=\"/4/26/4524\">Malayan Movies</a>) servicing the needs of various film producers, directors like <a href=\"/4/26/4704\">Carlos Vander Tolosa</a>, Jose Domingo Badilla, and <a href=\"/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a> packaged editing work in their contracts with movie producers, subsequently training and hiring cutters to do the elementary job of cutting and joining the materials so that they could devote more time to creative editing work. With the advent of the talking film or &#x201C;talkies,&#x201D; editing became a more complicated process, prompting Filipino film technicians to study under Hollywood-trained experts who were brought into the country with the new technology."

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Special effects</b> in film are devices used to enhance the cinematic language and aid the director in achieving credibility and communication in film. They can help create a different world or even a planet only seen in fantasy and science-fiction movies. They can also help recreate the past and envision the future. Initially, there were two types of effects: special effects and <b>optical effects</b>. Special effects were produced by artificial photographic process, to represent a building on fire, a mine exploding on the battlefield, and other such effects. Optical effects were done in the laboratory and include such technical devices as <b>dissolves</b>, <b>split-screens</b>, <b>superimpositions</b>, <b>wipes</b>, and <b>fades</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dissolves are two or more superimposed images, one gradually coming into prominence and the other or others disappearing. Split-screen refers to the juxtaposition of two or more separate images on screen. Superimpositions are two or more images, one over the other, occurring simultaneously on screen. The wipe refers to an image being pushed offscreen by another image either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The fade shows an image gradually appearing or disappearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The director decides, in consultation with the editor, where each optical is going to occur and how long the transition will be. Opticals have to be accurately calculated because they are crucial to the film&rsquo;s rhythm. While these effects were achieved before through a tedious process with the optical printer, today these effects are achieved with the computer and a flick of the mouse and, more importantly, can be previewed immediately on the monitor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Special effects may also refer to sounds that are not recorded during shooting but are produced artificially and recorded separately in an effects track to synchronize with the appropriate shots.

Awards may be given to films of particularly high quality by jury members. Typically, film festivals are attended by filmmakers, actors, film connoisseurs, and students, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Several countries all over the world hold film festivals regularly, ranging from larger film festivals, like the Cannes Film Festival, to smaller regional events that focus on works by local filmmakers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Europe is considered the cradle of the film festival phenomenon. The Venice Film Festival in Italy was founded in 1932 as part of the Venice Biennale. It is the oldest film festival and one of the most prominent in the world. The Cannes Film Festival was established in 1946 as a combined French, British, and American effort to go against the fascist dominance of the film festival in Venice. Another prominent festival is the Berlin International Film Festival, which was founded in 1951 and is annually held in Berlin, Germany. Film festivals have since then become showcases of national cinemas, eventually also functioning as both protectors of the cinematic art and facilitators of film industries. Soon after, there was a global spread of film festivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1966, Manila mayor Antonio J. Villegas inaugurated the Manila Film Festival. For the first time, locally produced films were screened in downtown theaters like Ideal, Odeon, State, Ever, Galaxy, and Capitol, which usually screened only Hollywood and foreign films. The festival provided respite from competition against Hollywood, giving Filipinos the opportunity to watch Tagalog pictures in Manila&rsquo;s &ldquo;first-class&rdquo; theaters. Atty Espiridion Laxa served as chairman of the festival, which began on 14 Jun and culminated on 24 Jun, coinciding with the city&rsquo;s foundation day. Eighteen local films (14 new, four re-releases) were screened. The top prize, the Rajah Soliman Grand Award for Best Picture, was given to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1145\">Ang Daigdig ng mga Api</a> </i></b>(The World of the Oppressed), 1965<i>.</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During its first run, many journalists praised the festival as the much-needed government action that manifests their support for the local filmdom. However, through the years, critics dismissed the festival as merely token support that did not address the more pressing issues plaguing the industry. Critics pointed out that US-Philippine co-productions like <b><i>The Brides of Blood Island</i></b>, 1966, and <b><i>The Passionate Strangers</i></b>, 1966,<b><i> </i></b>were allowed into the festival on the grounds that they were locally produced with Filipino actors. Furthermore, critics pointed out that some of the festival&rsquo;s box-office hits, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Tony Ferrer</a>&rsquo;s secret agent thrillers <b><i>Sabotage</i></b>,<b> </b>1966, and <b><i>Modus <strong>Opera</strong> ndi</i></b>, 1967, seemed to be the most imitative of Hollywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In spite of the controversies and criticism, the festival lasted until 1974. Throughout its nine-year stint, the festival exhibited several popular films, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4323\">Celso Ad. Castillo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Mahiwagang Daigdig ni Pedro Penduko</i></b> (The Mysterious World of Pedro Penduko), 1973, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4316\">Luciano Carlos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a>-starrer <b><i>Facifica Falayfay</i></b>, 1969, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4909\">German Moreno</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971, among others. In the last edition, the festival did not award the Rajah Soliman Grand Award to any of the competing films for the first time since its establishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Manila Film Festival became the Metropolitan Film Festival in 1975, covering the Greater Manila Area. In 1977, the festival was renamed Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF). Under the new direction of the Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association, the festival now encompassed the satellite cities that comprise Metro Manila. Today, the festival is presented by the Metro Manila Development Authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first edition began on 21 Sep 1975 to commemorate the third anniversary of the imposition of martial law. A year after, the festival started on Christmas day for the first time. In its first year, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4304\">Augusto Buenaventura</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Diligin Mo ng Hamog ang Uhaw na Lupa </i></b>(Water the Parched Earth with Dew), won the six major awards, including Best Picture. Films like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a></i></b>, 1980, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1207\"><strong>Kisapmata</strong></a></i></b> (Blink of an Eye), 1981, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><strong>Himala</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Miracle</i></b>), 1982, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1289\"><b><i>Shake,</i></b><i> <b>Rattle &amp; Roll </b></i></a>horror anthology all premiered in the festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The festival&rsquo;s 1986 edition was considered to be the worst in the festival&rsquo;s 12-year history at the time. For the first time, no competing film was awarded Best Picture and Second Best Picture. Only a Third Best Picture was cited, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Halimaw</strong> sa <strong>Banga</strong> </i></b>(Monster in a Jar). Tingting Cojuangco, chair of the board of jurors, announced during the ceremonies that none of the seven competing films deserved the Best Picture award and that the entries did not &ldquo;reinforce and inculcate positive Filipino values&rdquo; as they were only &ldquo;portraying negative stereotypes, imitating foreign films, and perpetuating commercially oriented movies&rdquo; (quoted in Vera 2014). In 1990, the Gatpuno Antonio J. Villegas Cultural Awards was first established to award the film that best portrays Filipino culture and Filipino people to the world. It was named after the festival&rsquo;s father, the late former Manila mayor Antonio J. Villegas who died in 1984. The award&rsquo;s first recipient was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4605\">Gil Portes</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Andrea, Paano Ba ang Maging Isang Ina? </i></b>(Andrea, How Does One Become a Mother?), 1990.<b> </b>Other later recipients were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4449\">Peque Gallaga</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1220\"><strong>Magic Temple</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1996, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1205\"><b><i>Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo</i></b></a> (Partner, Participant, Partaker), 2006, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4543\">Brillante Mendoza</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1303\"><strong>Thy Womb</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2010, the festival underwent significant changes. The commercial viability criterion for the selection of Best Pictures was removed. In the past editions, commercial viability accounted for 50 percent of the criteria for selection. The criteria dedicated 70 percent to artistic, creative, and technical excellence whereas the remaining 30 percent was devoted to values. In the same year, a new competitive section that featured local independent films was created. It was named &ldquo;New Wave&rdquo; in the following year. The section usually preceded the main competition. It included five full-length features and student short films. The first recipient of the Best Film award in this section was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4256\">Adolfo Alix Jr</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Presa</i></b> (Female Prisoner), 2010. Since then, the MMFF criteria have changed a number of times, often leaning toward commercial viability of films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Short film production, which was significant in the 1950s, contributed to the growth of cinema in the Philippines&mdash;particularly, alternative filmmaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1962, the Film Society of the Philippines, founded by Benedicto Pinga, a filmmaker and World War II veteran, held the First National Festival of Short Films. The entries in the competition attested to the status of the local short films as an alternative to the commercial narrative film. The second edition was held in 1964.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1981, the Manila Short Film Festival was held at the Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero Theater in the University of the Philippines (UP). It was organized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4405\">Nick Deocampo</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4623\">Raymond Red</a>&rsquo;s 25-minute short <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1222\"><strong>Ang Magpakailanman</strong></a> </i></b>(Eternity) won first prize in the experimental category during the 1983 edition of the festival. The festival primarily focused on short films to promote alternative filmmaking at a time when the mass media were controlled by the Marcos dictatorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Conversely, the Marcos government&rsquo;s Experimental Cinema of the Philippines also sponsored the Annual Short Film Festival from 1982 to 1985. The objectives of the festival include showcasing the craft and talent of the Filipino short filmmaker and celebrating his perseverance and passion for the film art. In its inaugural year, it was able to gather 96 entries, which was later reduced to 44.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Today, short film competitions are integrated in several film festivals as sections. Moreover, most regional film festivals&mdash;if not all&mdash;primarily focus on short films. The Mindanao Film Festival, started in 2004 in Davao, usually programs more than 50 short films from all over the island every year. Other regional film festivals&mdash;such as the CineKabalen Film Festival, established in 2009 in Pampanga; the BINISAYA Film Festival, established in 2011 in Cebu; and the Cinemagis Short Digital Film Festival, established in 2009 in Cagayan de Oro&mdash;also program short films in their respective regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These regional short films ultimately culminate in the Cinema Rehiyon Film Festival, which is presented by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4566\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">)</a>. It was first organized in 2008 through the Cinema Committee of the NCCA Subcommission on the Arts with the objective of showcasing cinematic works from various regions of the country, specifically outside Metro Manila. The festival is usually held every February, coinciding with the National Arts Month. The Cinema Rehiyon annually showcases an average of 50 short films from different regions outside Metro Manila as well as some regional full-length films. The first two editions were held at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4356\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> (CCP). Since 2011, a different region hosted the festival every year. The 2011 edition was in Davao, while the following editions were held in Bacolod, Los Ba&ntilde;os, Cagayan de Oro, and Cebu, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early editions, the festival followed rather informal curatorial policies. Films only had to showcase a level of competence in production quality, and they had to be reflective of their respective regions. The need for equal regional representation was also considered in the selection of the films to be exhibited. In 2012, the festival began to implement a more formal curatorial process, although it still retained the &ldquo;regional&rdquo; qualifier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, some film festivals were established with the objectives of reviving Philippine cinema and, at the same time, promoting independent filmmaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4337\">Cinemanila International Film Festival</a> (CIFF) was founded by Filipino filmmaker <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4250\">Amable &ldquo;Tikoy&rdquo; Aguiluz VI</a> in 1999. The festival was named after Lino Brocka&rsquo;s production company, which was formed in 1974. The festival&rsquo;s goals include the revitalization of the Philippines as the center of Southeast Asian cinema and the production of international caliber Filipino films. The CIFF specifically aimed to: (1) nurture young Filipino directors by providing them with the opportunity to see the best of World Cinema, (2) discover new talents in the Philippines and Southeast Asia in order for the Philippines to become the hub of Southeast Asian films, and (3) create a revitalized Filipino film industry that will become a major player in the Asian content industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">CIFF yearly celebrated and gave tribute to outstanding independent filmmakers. It celebrated outstanding Filipino and foreign filmmakers, including American director Quentin Tarantino, Indonesian actress/producer Christine Hakim, Filipino-American actors Lou Diamond Phillips and Tia Carrere, and Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles. Some of these as well as other important film artists gave lectures during the festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When it opened, CIFF had the following categories: International Competition, Southeast Asian Competition, Young Cinema: Documentaries, and Young Cinema: Shorts. Digital Lokal was added in 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cinemanila festival icon is the <i>bulol</i>, which is a Cordillera rice deity that is believed to ensure good harvest. The bulol trophy was designed by National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>. Due to lack of funding, the CIFF stopped in 2013, after 15 years of existence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But other international film festivals were established. The SalaMindanaw International Film Festival was founded by Mindanaon filmmaker Gutierrez Mangansakan II in General Santos City in 2013. It is the first international film festival in Mindanao. It held competitions for Asian full-length features, Asian short films, and Mindanao short films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine cinema experienced a steady decline in film production in the early 2000s. From around 120 films a year for wide release, only 49 films were produced in 2006. This decline can be attributed to several factors, such as rising cost of raw film stock, taxation, and foreign competition. However, digital filmmaking managed to revive the industry through the help of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Independent Film Festival</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\">Cinema One Originals Film Festival</a>, both established in 2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2004, Cinemalaya was officially established by businessman Antonio Cojuangco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4439\">Film Development Council of the Philippines</a> chairperson <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4465\">Laurice Guillen</a>, film enthusiasts Joey Avellana and Maan Hontiveros, CCP president <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2495\">Nestor Jardin</a>, and then-UP College of Mass Communications dean <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cinemalaya aims to (1) help develop and support the production of cinematic works of Filipino independent filmmakers that boldly articulate and freely interpret the Filipino experience with fresh insight and artistic integrity; (2) discover, encourage, support, train and recognize gifted Filipino independent filmmakers; (3) promote Filipino independent films locally and internationally; and (4) establish a network for exchange, communication, and cooperation among members of the independent film sector. The Cinemalaya festival logo is the <i>balanghai</i>, a vessel that the early Filipinos used during precolonial times in search of a land where they could live in freedom. The balanghai represents artistic expressiveness and boldness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cinemalaya is the first festival that began its selection process with the submission of synopses rather than finished projects. The selected projects would each receive a seed grant amounting to 500,000 pesos. The first edition exhibited nine digital features and six digital shorts, giving the first Best Film awards to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1264\"><strong>Pepot Artista</strong></a> </i></b>(Pepot Superstar) in the full-length category, and to Joel Ruiz&rsquo;s <b><i>Mansyon</i></b> (Mansion) in the short film category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Throughout the festival&rsquo;s 11 years of existence, it produced 112 films, some of which were commercially successful and received both local and international awards and critical acclaim. Some of these notable films are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Auraeus Solito</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1257\">Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo <strong>Oliveros</strong></a>&nbsp;</strong> </i></b>(<b><i>he Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros</i></b>), 2005, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4410\">Pepe Diokno</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Engkwentro </i></b>(<b><i>Clash</i></b>), 2009, and Milo Tolentino&rsquo;s <b><i>Andong</i></b>, 2008. Moreover, since 2006, five films that debuted in the festival were submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for consideration for the Best Foreign Film category of the annual Oscar Awards: <b><i>Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2006, Adolf Alix Jr&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1154\"><strong>Donsol</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2007, Marlon Rivera&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1108\"><strong>Ang Babae sa Septic Tank</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Woman in the Septic Tank</i></b>), 2011, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4498\">Jun Robles Lana</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1137\"><strong>Bwakaw</strong></a></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2012, and Hannah Espia&rsquo;s <b><i>Transit</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2010, entries were separated into two categories: the New Breed and the Directors Showcase. While the New Breed category featured films by new filmmakers directing their first full-length feature, the Directors Showcase category was reserved for veteran directors. However, the festival organizers decided to remove the New Breed category after the 2014 edition, limiting the competition to short films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cinema One Originals Film Festival is a project of Creative Programs Inc, an entertainment subsidiary of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\">ABS-CBN</a>, the country&rsquo;s largest media corporation The festival is produced by Cinema One, the country&rsquo;s popular Filipino cable channel that also airs local digital films. Similar to Cinemalaya&rsquo;s system, film projects are selected on the basis of scripts submitted and then awarded production grant of 600,000 pesos, which was later raised to 700,000 pesos in 2006, and to one million pesos in 2008. However, unlike in Cinemalaya, Cinema One reserves solo ownership of the film grantees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the Cinema One Originals entries that won Best Film are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4670\">Sherad Anthony Sanchez</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Huling Balyan ng Buhi </i></b>( <strong><em>The</em></strong> <b><i>Woven <strong>Stories</strong> of the Other</i></b>), 2006, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Confessional</i></b>, 2007, Sanchez&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1188\"><strong>Imburnal</strong></a> </i></b>(Sewers), 2008, Rey Defante Gibraltar&rsquo;s <b><i>Wanted: Border</i></b>, 2009, Remton Siega Zuasola&rsquo;s<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1146\"><strong>Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Dream of Eleuteria</i></b>), 2010, and Sari Lluch Dalena&rsquo;s <b><i>Ka Oryang </i></b>(<b><i>Comrade Oryang</i></b>), 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2012, entries were categorized according to blockbuster potential and market appeals. The two categories are called Currents and Plus. Three films that were deemed to be &ldquo;most commercial&rdquo; among the entries were included in the first batch of the Plus category. In 2013, five films in the Plus category were each given two million pesos compared to the one million peso grant given to the 10 entries in the Currents category (least commercial). In 2014, however, the two categories were removed. In future editions, the 10 selected films would compete in only one category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other similar grant-giving film festivals have since then emerged, such as the Mindanao Film Festival, 2004; the Cinema Rehiyon Festival, 2008; the Film Development Council&rsquo;s Sineng Pambansa, 2012; Unitel Productions&rsquo; CineFilipino Film Festival, 2013; the Quezon City International Film Festival (QCinema), 2013; GMA News TV&rsquo;s Cine Totoo Documentary Film Festival, 2014; and Sinag Maynila, 2015, which was founded by filmmaker Brillante Mendoza.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Khurshid <strong>Kala</strong> bud Jr, with notes from Christian Co&nbsp;</strong> </em><em><strong>and Gregory del Carmen</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"sources\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\">Source</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"sources\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"sources\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"sources\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vera, Noel. 2005. <em>Critic after Dark: A Review of Philippine Cinema</em>.

The Cannes Film Festival was established in 1946 as a combined French, British, and American effort to go against the fascist dominance of the film festival in Venice. Another prominent festival is the Berlin International Film Festival, which was founded in 1951 and is annually held in Berlin, Germany. Film festivals have since then become showcases of national cinemas, eventually also functioning as both protectors of the cinematic art and facilitators of film industries. Soon after, there was a global spread of film festivals."

Music that is part of the represented scene is termed <b>diegetic</b> or <b>source music</b>; that which is external to the narrative is termed <b>non-diegetic</b> or <b>extradiegetic</b>. In diegetic music, characters in the film can hear the music that is part of the fictional world being depicted or which they inhabit. This contrasts with the extradiegetic music, also called the <b>score</b>, which can only be heard by the audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music has three fundamental functions in Philippine films: (1) as accompaniment to silent film images; (2) as scoring, using existing or original music, which deepens the mood of the scene and the emotions of characters; and (3) as theme song, the elements of which become the basis for further musical variations that enhance the visual sequences. In principle, the second and third uses may overlap as required by this integrative audiovisual medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Music for the Silent Film</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first film was shown in the Philippines on 8 Sep 1897 by Swiss business partners Leibman and Peritz. They screened several Lumiere films, using a lumiere cinematograph. The show was accompanied by music provided by a guitarist under maestro Francisco P. de Barbat. The next year, 1898, Antonio Ramos, a Spanish military officer from Barcelona presented his own program of films, including those that he himself had shot in the Philippines, like <b><i>Escenas Callejeras</i></b> (Street Scenes), <b><i>Fiesta de Quiapo </i></b>(Quiapo Fiesta), and <b><i>Panorama de Manila</i></b> (Manila Panorama). Ramos is considered the first person to shoot a film in Manila. In 1905, Herbert Wyndham of the Edison Biograph also shot scenes in the Manila Fire Department (Sotto 1992, 5-6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The music accompaniment was needed in silent films to muffle the noise of the projector, which probably was overwhelming, given the fact that the early films in the Philippines were shown in a small room adjacent to a store and the audience was seated near the projector. Moreover, early films had to compete with live public entertainments such as <i>bailes</i> (dances held in clubs and theaters) and the popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><em>sarsuwela</em></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From 1902 until the erection of Albert Yearsley&rsquo;s Majestic Theater of 1912, which was large enough to be described as the first building solely dedicated to films, the screening of films, especially those managed by Walgraph, was billed with sarsuwela, songs, and musical interludes. But because they could not yet compete with the sarsuwela, which was the dominant genre of public entertainment, films rode on the popularity of the form. Thus, in 1906, the Cinematografo-Teatro Cervantes showed films as enticers, front acts, or divertissements to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2936\">Praxedes Fernandez</a>&rsquo;s zarzuela, <b><i>Sensitiva</i></b>. In the advertisement for this zarzuela, the titles of films were not even announced, manifesting their low value compared to the main entertainment. Besides, up until 1909, only a limited number of films, mainly those from Pathe in France, were shown in Manila again and again, and so the medium quickly lost its novelty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The orchestras for film were small chamber music ensembles, similar or identical to those that played in the sarsuwela. From 1902 to 1910, musicians involved in accompanying films were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3979\">Jose Estella</a>, with the Rizal orchestra quintet, at the Cinematografo-Teatro Nuevo Cervantes in 1905; Pedro Madariaga who directed music for the Gran Cinematografo Filipino in 1905 and the Gran Cinematografo del Oriente in 1906; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\">Bonifacio Abdon</a>, with Sexteto Orquesta Rizal, at the Gran Cinematografo-Teatro Cervantes in 1906; Manuel Egea who was in the Gran Teatro-Cinematografo Libertad; and Jose Vedal and Henri Niviere at the Walgraph. Except for Estella, a Filipino whose career was already well established in Manila, it was the foreign musicians who dominated the exhibition and marketing of film entertainment in Philippine cities. After Pedro Madariaga left the Gran Cinematografo del Oriente, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3917\">Francisco Buencamino</a>&nbsp;replaced him as the director of the orchestra. Estella, Abdon, and Buencamino were therefore three of the important film music practitioners in early silent films. From them, the next generation of urban Filipino musicians, such as piano players <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\">Nicanor Abelardo</a>, would learn how to eke out a living by playing the piano to accompany silent films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the absence of archival data, it is not known specifically how the chamber music ensembles or orchestras from 1902 to 1910, and later the piano, managed to accompany the films&mdash;specifically, how they matched their music to the visuals&rsquo; narratives. What is clear, however, is that music was still just an arbitrary accessory to the images because music was performed ad hoc and was external to its production; it was added later in real time and was not part of the making of the film product. The repertory of music in silent films came from different foreign sources; but as years went by, local music must have been used more and more. Evidence of many extant collections of semiclassical music for small ensembles and piano albums from the period, many of which had simplified arrangements of popular classical music, would seem to prove that film musicians were quite equipped to tackle the wide range of moods and sentiments embodied in the projected images and narratives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the first American-owned movie production companies started to produce original films in the 1910s, there was an impetus to make music more expressive of the film&rsquo;s narrative, and sounds began to be organically connected to the visuals. Scoring, which appropriated canned music, was made through phonographs and records when these became available beginning 1910. Some theater owners utilized gramophones to substitute for live music performance in order to fill in the aural vacuum in silent films and to save up on the cost of employing live musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Canned music paralleled the stock music in albums which comprised of classical music with light and easy arrangements that were played by small music ensembles and pianists. However, phonographs were fragile machines with tiny sounds and not as reliable as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/822\">pianos</a> whose industrial cast-iron strength and versatility were unmatched by any other instrument. In some cases, the songs that were supposed to be performed by actors on-screen were dubbed live by actors who sang behind the screen, in sync with the screen images. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>&rsquo;s production of <b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b> (Country Maiden), a film adaptation of the highly successful <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\">sarsuwela</a> of the same title in 1919, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a><strong> </strong> herself came on stage to sing &ldquo;Nabasag ang Banga&rdquo; (The Claypot Broke) in sync with the movements of her own image on-screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decade of 1910s was an important time in Philippine film history, for it was then when films began to be locally produced. Then American resident Albert Yearsley was said to be the first to produce films locally. These were mostly documentaries of local events and historical subjects. His sensational 20-minute fictional film on the death of Rizal titled <b><i>La Pasion y Muerte de Dr. Rizal</i></b> (The Passion and Death of Dr Rizal), alternately called <b><i>El Fusilamiento de Dr. <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </i></b> (The Execution of Dr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>), was hurriedly shot in 1912 to compete with the American tandem of Harry Brown and Edward Meyer Gross who were going to screen in the same month the hour-long <b><i>La Vida de Jose Rizal</i></b> (The Life of Jose Rizal). What types of music accompanied these two Rizal films are not known, but by that time, there were already numerous pieces of music commemorating Rizal&rsquo;s death and heroism that musicians could choose from. Later on, American films that were locally produced depicted cultural practices like the pilgrimage to Antipolo, which both Yearsley and Brown-Gross produced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1920s, Nicanor Abelardo&rsquo;s generation was succeeded by musicians like Spanish criollo Benito Trapaga, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4217\">Miguel Velarde Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4170\">Juan Silos Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3958\">Constancio de Guzman</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3882\">Ariston Avelino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4274\">Tito Arevalo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4182\">Santiago Suarez</a>, and Spanish expatriate concert pianist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3867\">Julio Esteban Anguita</a>. There were no hard-and-fast rules on how the necessary piano music supplement could be realized in theater. But considering the expertise of Filipino musicians in composing for live musical theater, local music such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><em>kundiman</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/35\">balitaw</a></em>, and <b>danza</b> must have been utilized to meet the emotional requirements of the scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The practice of using canned music during the silent film era was to continue in sound films from the 1930s all the way to 1960s. It is still practiced in contemporary TV production. Canned music is properly called appropriated scores, which means music by composers other than the music director of the film, and it was definitely inferior to live performances, which were tailored to the specific communicative requirement of the film&rsquo;s narrative. Besides, canned music can never fully express the complexity of moods and emotions in a film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The extant scores of Jose Estella&rsquo;s &ldquo;Un Escena Musical en Antipolo&rdquo; (A Musical Scene in Antipolo) and &ldquo;Es La Virgen de Antipolo: Escena 161&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s the Virgin of Antipolo: Scene 161), now archived at the University of the Philippines (UP) College of Music Library, are original film music scores made either for Yearsley&rsquo;s or Brown-Gross&rsquo;s film in the mid-1910s or perhaps during the early 1930s. Which version was composed for whose film on Antipolo cannot be determined. The number &ldquo;161&rdquo; marked on the piece &ldquo;Es La Virgen de Antipolo&rdquo; in red-colored pencil would suggest that this score was linked to an original playscript, which may have been for a silent or a sound film. Other extant Jose Estella film music scores of the period that are now in UP are &ldquo;Ang Buhay ng Mangingisda&rdquo; (The Life of a Fisherman), a song from the film <b><i>Ang Uliran</i></b> (The Ideal) with words by Ilagan, and &ldquo;Apache Vals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Music in Pre-World War II Sound Films </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The establishment of the movie studio system in the country&mdash;with companies like the Nepomuceno-Harris-Tait partnership <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>, 1934; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\">Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</a>, 1935; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, 1937; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, 1939; and X&rsquo;Otic Films, 1939&mdash;was a watershed in the history of Philippine film music. The task of synchronizing dialogue and environment sound with image involved other tasks such as dubbing, music recording, playback recording (a type of lip-synching), and rerecording. A well-known singer who did the singing voice of non-singing vedettes was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4720\">Fely Vallejo</a>, who later married director Gerardo de Leon. The clapper device was necessary for syncing sound recording and image into separate tracks in the reels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film music score, technically speaking, therefore only arrived when the talking picture or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1091\">sound</a> movie technology became available. The first film of this kind in the Philippines was George Musser&rsquo;s <b><i>Ang Aswang</i></b> (The Aswang) produced by Manila Talktone in 1932. Not long after, Jose Nepomuceno, the &ldquo;Father of Philippine Movies,&rdquo; made <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1270\">Punyal na Ginto</a>&nbsp;</strong></i></b>(Golden Dagger), 1933, the first Filipino sound film. At that time, because the technology was new and the synchronization of sound and image was a challenge, Nepomuceno had to seek the help of American producer George Harris and his Hollywood technical team. Because there is no extant copy of Nepomuceno&rsquo;s film, one is deprived of describing the film score as an object of analysis and criticism. Nonetheless, in Harris&rsquo;s film <b><i>Zamboanga</i></b>, 1936, which was a joint project of Filipino and foreign technical crews, one witnesses the incorporation of classic Hollywood techniques in Edward Kilenyi&rsquo;s film scoring, which was composed in Hollywood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are five extant films from 1938 to 1941, which allow us to discuss the different uses of film music before it blossomed in the 1950s, a golden age of Philippine cinema. These films were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a></i></b>, 1937, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4369\">Eduardo de Castro</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1169\"><b><i><strong>Giliw Ko</strong> </i></b></a> (My Love), directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\">Carlos Vander Tolosa</a>, 1939; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1311\"><strong>Tunay na Ina</strong></a></i></b> (Real Mother), directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4685\">Octavio Silos</a>, 1939; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1261\"><b><i><strong> <strong>Pakiusap</strong> </strong> </i></b></a> (Plea), directed by Octavio Silos, 1940; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\"><b><i>Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong> </i></b></a> (Adarna Bird), directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>, 1941. <b><i>Zamboanga</i></b> was a south sea adventure film, <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b> and <b><i>Pakiusap </i></b>were romances, <b><i>Tunay na Ina </i></b>was a melodrama with music, and <b><i><strong> <strong><strong>Ibong Adarna</strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> was mythological. Their being musical unmistakably had its influence from the Filipino sarsuwela tradition, and therefore they can be called <strong>sarsuwela films</strong> &mdash;a term <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a> coined for films that are made in the sarsuwela tradition, as opposed to filmed sarsuwela or an already existing sarsuwela made into film like <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b> and <b><i><strong>Walang Sugat</strong> </i></b>(No Wounds). Sarsuwela film music style was one that developed internally, even if there were some influences from Hollywood. Other sarsuwela films were Carlos Vander Tolosa&rsquo;s <b><i>Nasaan Ka</i></b> <b><i>Irog </i></b>(Where Are You, Beloved?) 1937, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1125\"><strong> <strong>Bituing Marikit</strong> </strong></a> </i></b>(Beautiful Star), 1937, and <b><i>Madaling Araw </i></b>(Break of Dawn), 1938; Octavio Silos&rsquo;s <b><i>Paruparong</i></b> <b><i>Bukid </i></b>(Country Butterfly), 1938; and Santiago Suarez&rsquo;s <b><i>Magbalik Ka Hirang </i></b>(Come Back, My Love), 1940. No copies of these films have survived, however.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The majority of the musical numbers in these pre-World War II films were newly composed by Edward Kilenyi for <b><i>Zamboanga</i></b>, Juan Silos Jr and Ariston Avelino for <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, Miguel Velarde Jr and Juan Silos Jr for <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, Miguel Velarde Jr for <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b>, and Francisco Buencamino Sr with his son Francisco Jr for <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Zamboanga</i></b> is an interesting film because it contains actual footage of the Muslim war dance <i>sagayan</i>, accompanied by authentic diegetic <b>kulintang</b> (brass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a> of graduated sizes) music. Its newly composed extradiegetic score for the dramatic actions, however, came from the convention of Hollywood, which uses a lush, late 19th-century romantic symphonic sonority, which has nothing to do with the Southeast Asian musical traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, many songs and dances were diegetic. This is so because the story revolves around Guia, a barrio lass who aspires to be an urbanite singer, following her attraction to the landlord&rsquo;s Americanized son Antonio, a musician. The matching of the characters&rsquo; identities and musical styles are apt and convincing. Well-thought-out is the imaginary scene showing the blind old man, the father of Jose who belonged to the peasant class and therefore more suited to be Guia&rsquo;s partner, playing an instrument of the poor, a bamboo cello or <em>musikong bumbong</em>. In this scene, the blind old man is hearing an extradiegetic music, as if telepresencing his auditors, the moviegoers, who are outside the screen&rsquo;s reality. What is remarkable in this scene is that it happens at around the time when the hacienda owners are listening to the voice of country girl Guia via the cosmopolitan radio, thus producing a parallelism, a poignant layering that mirrors what the old man is hearing. The intelligent musical plan in the scene clearly manifests Silos&rsquo;s sensitivity to the difference between diegetic and extradiegetic music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The success in matching song genres with characterization is also evident in the other three extant films. In <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, the male protagonist named Ernesto sings Santiago&rsquo;s kundiman <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/966\">&ldquo;Pakiusap&rdquo;</a> in an uncannily haunting scene by a river beside a nipa hut, which is the abode of his beloved Amparing. This song is the theme song of the movie, so to speak. In a romantic scene when Ernesto, the landlord&rsquo;s son, disguises himself as a peasant so he can approach Amparing in the fields, the danza <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/874\">&quot;Buhat,&quot;</a>&nbsp;one of Velarde&rsquo;s most beloved songs, captures beautifully the coquettish lightness of the first encounter between the soon-to-be lovers. In <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b>, the unwed mother named Magdalena (named after the biblical figure) intones the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in Latin as a song of mourning&mdash;a funeral song in front of the tomb of her father. Oppressed by conservative patriarchal values, Magdalena has to relinquish her motherly right to raise an illegitimate daughter to protect her family&rsquo;s honor. The song expresses the pain of her subjection to a cruel social world, which she cannot transcend. In <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>, the bird sings exotic coloratura runs&mdash;a Spanish mannerism&mdash;as if this were the bird&rsquo;s language from a past and distant world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Moreover, in these extant films, diegetic music correctly gives viewers a sense of Filipino lifeworlds: musikong bumbong orchestra and jazz orchestra as symbols of rural and urban spaces, respectively, in <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>; marching brass <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/800\">bands</a> and rondalla in <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>; and even fantastical Filipino orientalist imagination of distant places in <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>. Sentimental scenes of longing are captured by kundiman songs, coquettish romance by the danza especially in <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, and humor by the dirty songs of lowly &ldquo;clownish&rdquo; characters. In these song-and-dance numbers, one feels a manifestation of a distinctly Filipino sensibility. They have no counterpart elsewhere because they are rooted in the tradition of the indigenized sarsuwela. Even the convention of composing the music of opening and closing credits owes to the tradition of writing overtures, entr&rsquo;acte, and finales of sarsuwela music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b>, and <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b> are effective as sarsuwela films, specifically in correlating the characters with music genres and in rendering the liveliness of scenes through the kinetic spectacle of festive celebration, folk dancing, and collective music making, the dramatic articulation of the four films&rsquo; narratives generally fails to be at par with the musical and dance numbers. The function of the extradiegetic music to articulate the dramatic element is important, and it is this function that moves the story to action and suspense, thereby generating the film&rsquo;s energy and intensity. Except for <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, the films rely heavily on stock musical formulas or canned music in most of their extradiegetic music in rendering dramatic scenes. In <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, for example, Bach&rsquo;s <em><strong>Air in G</strong> </em> is used to simply fill in the passage of time as the distraught Amparing tries to borrow money that she needs to bail out her imprisoned father. The effect of this appropriated music is static, for it simply judges Amparing to be already pitiable and does not draw in the audience to increasing empathy. In <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>, the horse chase depicting Juan abducting Maria and bringing her to his kingdom is accompanied by the orchestra playing the clich&eacute;d passage of 16 notes from Rossini&rsquo;s <em><strong>William Tell Overture</strong> </em>.In the next scene, while Maria stays in an inn, dialogues are backgrounded, as in melodrama, with inert appropriated&mdash;even ballet-like&mdash;symphonic music coming from a played-back sound recording machine that does not relate in any way to the emotional cues of danger and anxiety that Maria is facing. Canned extradiegetic music is all the more glaring in <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b> where it is used, as in <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, as a melodramatic filler, thus failing to make the audience understand the complex dramatic emotions that Magdalena as a mother has to struggle with vis-&agrave;-vis the loss of her daughter&mdash;that is, between her biological instinct to care for her and the cruel and unjust patriarchally ordered social world that took her daughter away from her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the said pre-World War II films, the practice of canned music seems to be, on the one hand, a legacy of the less-planned matching of music score to visuals from the silent film era, during which time extradiegetic music simply filled in the acoustic space, without a careful planning of the score to move the dramatic shape of sound into a cohesive multimedia. On the other, this kind of scoring may have been influenced by the formulaic melodramatic music of soap operas of radio programs that had to cut down on the high cost of composing and recording original scores. Canned music was to survive many more decades and was even evident in the best dramatic films that the Philippines had made during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b><strong>Film Music</strong> from 1946 to 2000</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film music in Philippine cinema during the postwar era was greatly influenced by the need to rehabilitate and uplift the Filipinos&rsquo; war-torn spirits. The tradition of theater and entertainment from American musicals and vaudeville became staples for many films during this era. The primary studios then&mdash;LVN Pictures, Sampaguita Pictures, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere Productions</a> (founded 1946)&mdash;mostly came up with films that provided escape for the audience. Thus production numbers, songs, and dances, just like the musical stage shows in the old Manila opera houses, were integrated into the film narratives. LVN&rsquo;s producer Do&ntilde;a Narcisa Buencamino de Leon, or Do&ntilde;a Sisang to her colleagues, opted to produce films based on metrical romances such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1163\"><b><i><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</i></b></a><i> </i>(Florante and Laura), 1939; <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>, 1941 and 1955; and <b><i>Doce Pares</i></b><i> </i>(Twelve Pairs), 1954. Correspondingly, the type of music and soundtrack used in these films accompanied the dances and movements required by the film genre, while traditional music, folk songs, kundiman music, and Spanish-influenced music filled the aural atmosphere of the films. The acoustic texture also coincided with the producer&rsquo;s vision to portray Filipino countryside life and tradition through the music and dances. In the film <b><i>Barrio Fiesta</i></b>, 1959, the effervescence of the festivities was expressed through a merriment of guitar tunes and songs, and playful frenzy between the ladies and the men from the barrio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dominating the decade were prominent film scorers such as Francisco Buencamino, whose score for the film <b><i><strong>Mutya ng Pasig</strong> </i></b> (Muse of Pasig), 1950, featured the titular song composed by Nicanor Abelardo. Buencamino also created the film score for <b><i><strong> <strong>Kundiman</strong> </strong> ng Lahi</i></b> (Love Song of the Race), 1959, which used Nicanor Abelardo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/918\">Kundiman ng </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/929\">Luha</a>&rdquo; (Love Song of Tears) as theme song. This is a film reminiscent not of the festive music of the town&rsquo;s celebration but of the rhythm produced by the pounding of a mortar and pestle which uniquely transitioned from a diegetic sound to non-diegetic, depicting the lives of people from the countryside. Another one of his works was the score for <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1104\"><i>Anak Dalita</i></a></strong> (<i>The Ruins</i>), 1956, a film portraying the plight of the impoverished, which was a complete departure from the usually cheerful song-and-dance movie theme. The film&rsquo;s theme, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/917\">Anak Dalita</a>,&rdquo; a kundiman composed by Francisco Santiago with lyrics by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5083\">Jesus Balmori</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5662\">Deogracias Rosario</a>, was an apt rendition and orchestration of the postwar crises faced by the Filipinos. It showed the ruins of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, displaced families, makeshift shelters, and a bleak picture of a dying woman whose last wish was to see her only son who was sent to war. Other notable film scorers of this era, who continued with their craft until the 1960s, were Carlos Aguilar, Tito Arevalo, Ariston Avelino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3935\">Josefino Cenizal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4339\">Joe Climaco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4347\">F. H. Constantino</a>, Constancio de Guzman, Juan Silos Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4172\">Leopoldo Silos</a>, Santiago Suarez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4202\">Restie Umali</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\">Mike Velarde</a>, and Joaquin Velasco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from the use of traditional folk songs, Juan Silos Jr also composed music that had sprightly rhythms, influenced by the tango and the polka, and were used to accompany vibrant film visuals. His works were mostly heard in films that showcased romantic comedy narratives starring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4396\">Nestor de Villa</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4298\">Nida Blanca</a>, who depicted a boisterous tandem dancing spiritedly to fast-paced tunes and songs that were later on played in jukeboxes and over the airwaves. Among these films were <b><i><strong>Waray-Waray</strong> </i></b>, 1954; <b><i>Ikaw Kasi</i></b><i> </i>(You Are to Blame), 1955; and <b><i>Bahala Na</i></b> (Come What May), 1957. In an interview (Mercado 1977), Silos said that he was being very modest when he said that the music in a film actually is the reason why a film becomes a blockbuster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music and sound heavily influence the audience&rsquo;s reaction and patronization of the films. Some Filipino films used Western canned music instead of original film compositions as soundtracks, an observation that received a stark commentary from film critic Pio de Castro (Del Mundo 1986). Jukebox film musicals that starred <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\">Diomedes Maturan</a>, a young singer and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a> </i></b>(Call of the Stage)<b><i> </i></b>champion, captivated the audience in the late 1950s and early 1960s. His film <b><i>Rose Tattoo ng Buhay Ko</i></b> (Rose Tattoo of My Life), 1958, was a romance musical about an amateur singer who won a national contest, and it launched Maturan&rsquo;s career with LVN. The song was initially sung and popularized by a British solo singer named Lita Roza in 1956. Maturan also starred in comedy musicals such as <b><i>Botika sa Baryo</i></b> (Pharmacy in the Barrio), 1960, and <b><i>Prinsipe Diomedes at ang Mahiwagang Gitara</i></b> (Prince Diomedes and the Magical Guitar), 1961, both scored by Francisco Buencamino, and filled with lively musical and dance numbers. He was also the lead for other film musicals such as <b><i>Oy, Akin Yata Yan</i></b> (Hey, I Think That Is Mine), 1962 and <b><i>Yeba Chiquicha</i></b>, 1963, which were both scored by Leopoldo Silos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The late 1960s to the early 1970s was a continuation of romance musicals, especially with the rise of the young singing love team of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4354\">Tirso Cruz III</a>. Their film musicals included <b><i>Guy and Pip</i></b>, 1971; <b><i>My Blue Hawaii</i></b>, 1972; and <b><i>Winter Holiday</i></b>, 1972. Many of their films were musicals featuring song-and-dance numbers and using mostly foreign pop hits. The song &ldquo;Alone Again (Naturally),&rdquo; written and originally performed by Irish singer-songwriter Gilbert Sullivan, was sung by Nora Aunor as the theme song for <b><i>A Gift of Love</i></b>, 1972, which was filmed in the United States. Film critics of this era lamented the commercialization of musicals, which merely cashed in on the popularity of the Aunor-Cruz tandem while perpetuating the use of canned foreign music in the film scores (del Mundo, in Tiongson 1983).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The mid-1970s to the early 1980s presented a counterpoint in film narratives, deviating from the long period of preoccupation with musicals and shifting to narratives that portray social and political realities while employing film aesthetic techniques from the West. Film music and sound went along with these changes, so visual narratives were now accompanied and relayed not by repetitive canned foreign music but by original, restrained tunes that communicated the sensibility and timbre of the issues articulated by the films. The Gawad Urian of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a>, a reputable film critics organization formed in 1976, handed out the Best Musical Score award only to films that use original music, preferably music created solely for the film itself. This award thrusts the film composer and scorer into the limelight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4486\">Max Jocson</a> was a frontrunner in film music scoring during this period, with his well-received scores for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><strong>Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Manila in the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1975, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Rites of May</i></b>), 1976. Both scores conveyed the films&rsquo; temperament, highlighting the range of his musical capabilities. In <b><i>Itim</i></b>, the music was interwoven within the dynamics of both pagan and Catholic rituals, in between the anguished sounds of a distressed spirit during a s&eacute;ance and the sorrowful chants of the townsfolk during a <i>pabasa </i>(chanting of the passion of Christ). The music tracks created by the synthesizer were jarring but not overpowering, haunting but not horrifying, and melancholic but not melodramatic. Jocson&rsquo;s intentional irregular melodies and abruptly ended tones coincided with the combination of the mystery, darkness, and somehow the eerie solemnity in the film&rsquo;s scenes. Vanishing Tribe, a band composed of four members, used electronic music for the scores of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1194\"><strong>Jaguar</strong></a></i> </b>(Guard), 1979, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1139\"><b><i>Manila by Night</i></b></a>, 1980. For both film scores, the band employed a jazz-funk fusion aura for the sinister and dark character of the city spaces explored in the film narratives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another noteworthy film scorer for this decade was Minda Azarcon, a famous opera singer in the 1970s, who created the scores for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></i></b>, 1976, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1300\"><strong>Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos</strong></a></i></b> (Three Godless Years), 1976. <b><i>Insiang</i></b><i> </i>opens with a melodramatic track against the backdrop of the 1970s urban life in Tondo, Manila&mdash;the garbage dump that coincides with the raucous environment, vulgar language, and chaos that envelope the community where Insiang lives. The rape and violence she endures in the hands of her mother&rsquo;s lover are foreshadowed by repeating snippets of initially soft melodies, which transform into quivers of malice as these are accompanied by the sound of running water from the faucet. The soft melodies eventually become sinister and dark, and the squeals of animals in the slaughterhouse at the beginning of the film are replaced by screams of a rapist butchered by his former lover. <b><i>Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos</i></b> has the same ominous timbre; the gloomy bass and organ tones are piled up along with the corpses and remains in the midst of death and destruction essayed by World War II and the Japanese occupation in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a> scored important films such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1166\"><b><i>Ganito Kami Noon &hellip; Paano Kayo Ngayon?</i></b></a> (This Was How We Were &hellip; What Happens to You Now?), 1976, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a></i></b>, 1980, and highlighted his flexibility and originality as a film composer. In <b><i>Ganito</i></b>, guitar and string melodies, as well as patriotic themes, complement the film&rsquo;s Spanish setting and aid in recreating the context of the Philippine Revolution through the eyes of a simpleminded peasant, Kulas. <b><i>Bona</i></b><i> </i>is all about the sacrifice and irrational servitude of Bona to an aspiring actor, which is mirrored in the simple, repetitive percussion sound sequences that compose her character&rsquo;s leitmotif. The beats and cadences are like Bona&rsquo;s daily expressions of devotion to an abusive object of affection such as the chores and errands that occupy her day in a life of masochistic subservience. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a> did the scores for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\"><b><i>Aguila</i></b></a>, 1980, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1204\"><strong>Karnal</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>Of the Flesh</i></b>), 1983. In <b><i>Aguila</i></b>, Cayabyab creates a melodious theme song that varies to suit the temper of each scene and generally weaves in and out of the different types of music he uses to characterize each major period from the 1890s to the 1980s. In <b><i>Karnal</i></b>, Cayabyab&rsquo;s powerful orchestra music adeptly matches, balances, and supplements the themes of family tragedy and the cruelty of patriarchy in the film. From soft and deceivingly tender tones to soaring and shrill sounds, the music tracks carefully narrates the tension, violence, and darkness that plagued the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many dramatic films from the 1980s widely used original Filipino compositions as titular theme music. The practice of using Western canned music was replaced by the use of original film tracks, if not original Filipino pop songs or ballads. Filipino ballads composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3947\">Willy Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3925\">George Canseco</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4214\">Rey Valera</a> became theme songs for various local films in the 1980s and 1990s that capitalized on the genre of melodrama. The film narratives were woven around these songs. Willy Cruz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bituing Walang Ningning&rdquo; (Star without Sparkle), 1985, and &ldquo;Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas&rdquo; (I Wish This Were Forever), 1986, both titular theme songs, were sung by the lead film actress for both films, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\">Sharon Cuneta</a><i>.<b> Sana&rsquo;y Wala Nang Wakas&nbsp;</b></i>(Wishing It Would Never End) used the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/996\">theme song</a>&rsquo;s fragments throughout the film, narrating the scenes of three female singers brought together by friendship, broken apart by jealousy, and eventually reunited through music. The titular theme song, which was sung at the end of the film, was an homage to the father of the lead character, who also composed the song before his death. George Canseco&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gaano Kadalas ang Minsan&rdquo;<i> </i>(How Often Is Once), 1982, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/1006\">Sinasamba Kita</a>&rdquo; (I Worship You), 1983, were also recognized by award-giving bodies, with the former winning Best Theme Song and the latter Best Original Song. Rey Valera&rsquo;s compositions became popular movie theme songs in the early 1990s. Some of these were &ldquo;Maging Sino Ka Man&rdquo; (Whoever You May Be), 1991, sung by Sharon Cuneta, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/887\">Di Na Natuto</a>&rdquo; (You Never Learn), 1993, sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4213\">Gary Valenciano</a>. These theme songs were constantly played on the radio and topped the original Pilipino music charts, and records and cassette tapes of these were sold out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film music themes since the 1990s were a combination of both Filipino and Western pop hits. Cayabyab continued to create scores that employed his own compositions and original Filipino music, two of which were <b><i>Hihintayin Kita sa Langit</i></b> (I Will Wait for You in Heaven), 1991, and <b><i><strong>Saan Ka Man Naroroon</strong> </i></b> (Wherever You Are), 1993. The song &ldquo;Hanggang sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan&rdquo; (Until the End of Eternity), composed by George Canseco, was the theme song for <b><i>Hihintayin Kita sa Langit</i></b>, and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/995\">Saan Ka Man Naroroon</a>,&rdquo; composed by Restie Umali, was for the movie with the same title. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4306\">Dionisio Jose &ldquo;Nonong&rdquo; Buencamino Jr</a> did the score and theme song for <b><i>Natutulog Ba ang Diyos</i></b> (Is God Sleeping), 1988, with the titular theme music sung by Gary Valenciano. He also created the scores for <b><i>May Minamahal</i> </b>(<b><i>Loving Someone</i></b>), 1993, with the theme music composed by Willy Cruz and sung by Rachel Alejandro; for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1144\"><strong>Dahil Mahal Kita: The Dolzura Cortez Story</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Because I Love You</i></b>), 1993, composed by Manuel Mallilin and sung by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3860\">Ogie Alcasid</a>; and for <b><i>Sana Dalawa ang Puso Ko</i> </b>(Wish I Had Two Hearts), 1995, composed by Bodjie Dasig and sung by Ariel Rivera. Buencamino also lent his musical skills to do the scores for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1233\"><strong>Milagros</strong></a></i></b>, 1997, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\"><b><i>Jose Rizal</i></b></a>, 1998, which both won honors at the Gawad Urian. His film music contributions continued up to the new millennium. With the songs being played on the radios and sung by the singers on television, and with the advent of better sound quality through CD players, the rise of the artists in the 1990s, such as Valenciano, Alcasid, Alejandro, and Rivera, reinforced how the audience recognized and supported the films with titular theme songs, similar to the film-theme music partnership in the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other film composers who were usually tapped by both mainstream and independent productions in the 1990s and 2000s were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4517\">Jesse Lucas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4504\">Jessie Lasaten</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4074\">Joy Marfil</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4378\">Vincent de Jesus</a>. Jesse Lucas created the score for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1106\"><strong>Babae sa Breakwater</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Woman of Breakwater</i></b>) and put into good use the songs of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\">Yoyoy Villame</a>, which can be categorized as novelty songs about the lives of the ordinary folk. Villame&rsquo;s witty rhymes and upbeat rhythms are realized within the film&rsquo;s desolate themes of urban migration and urban poverty. Soft music tracks also contrast Villame&rsquo;s lively limericks, allowing the viewer/listener space to balance out the varied melodies. Jessie Lasaten&rsquo;s work in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1287\"><strong>Segurista</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>Dead Sure</i></b>), 1996, foregrounds the familiar sounds of the business districts of Metro Manila where the main character Karen is an insurance agent by day and a guest relations officer in a karaoke bar by night. Karaoke pop songs and the lively ballroom dance music begin to fade and are replaced with slow, sad tunes once Karen sets foot on her lahar-stricken hometown in Pampanga. And an innocent lullaby accompanies her bedtime stories while she puts her child to sleep, and signals another dizzying day of traveling back to the city. Joy Marfil&rsquo;s work for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1232\"><strong>Mga Munting Tinig</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Small Voices</i></b>), 2002, brims with hope and idealism, just like its main character Melinda, a young substitute teacher who chooses to serve in a public school in a remote province. Poverty and political unrest beleaguer the community, and the only respite of the children from this predicament is Melinda&rsquo;s effort to inspire them to hone their singing talents and participate in a local contest. The song&rsquo;s theme song, &ldquo;Mga Munting Tinig,&rdquo; is sung at the end of the film to remember one of the fallen choir members who became a victim of a clash between the military and the rebels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vincent de Jesus&rsquo;s film scores for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1319\"><strong>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Moveeh</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Zsazsa Zaturnnah: The Movie), 2006, and <b><i>I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila! </i></b>(I Do Bidoo Bidoo: The APO Is Here!), 2012, are well-known. In contrast to the film musicals in the 1970s, the songs for these films are local and original. De Jesus created the music for <b><i>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Moveeh</i></b>, an adaptation of Carlo Vergara&rsquo;s graphic novel <b><i>Ang Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Zsazsa Zaturnnah</i></b><i> </i>(The Amazing Adventures of Zsazsa Zaturnnah), published in 2003 and also <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/692\">adapted into stage</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> in 2005 in which de Jesus was the lyricist, composer, and musical director. The film&rsquo;s opening scene sets the mood for the entire film&mdash;a vivacious production number with characters singing and dancing in the rain, not like Gene Kelly&rsquo;s and Debbie Reynold&rsquo;s stylized version but capturing local color, complete with Manila&rsquo;s enormous puddles and hopeful teens hoping for a cancellation of classes. <b><i>I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila!</i></b><i> </i>starts with a medley of songs from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3868\">Apo Hiking Society</a>, the pop trio with the longest staying power in the country. The film is a scrapbook of pop music, gaudy costumes, and color splattered across the backdrop of Manila&rsquo;s bustle, its streets, landmarks, and daily commute. The images alternate with the medley&rsquo;s vibrancy and the flamboyance of the characters, which include a young couple expecting a child and are torn between their respective families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For some films during the late 1990s to the early 2000s, the theme music became the blueprint for the other film tracks. Same tunes were carved from the main theme song and spread out as fragments of music throughout the film&rsquo;s scenes, using a variety of instrumentations. This could have helped create a musical leitmotif for a specific character or space, but the repetitive tunes simply added to the recall of the theme song, instead of creating a tenuous synchronization of image and sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Mainstream and major production studios dictate the use of foreign popular songs as film titles, and some films in the 2000s repeated the earlier practice of using Western canned music, some of which were even initially used already as foreign film theme music and as foreign film titles. Some examples include <b><i>Till There Was You</i></b>, 2003, produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a> and <b><i>Let the Love Begin</i></b>, 2005, produced by GMA Films. &ldquo;Till There Was You,&rdquo; a song written by Meredith Wilson in 1957, was also the title of a 1997 Hollywood romantic comedy film, produced by Lakeshore Entertainment and directed by Scott Winant. &ldquo;Let the Love Begin&rdquo; was written by Gloria Sklerov and Lenny Macaluso and was also used as a theme for the American movie <b><i>Thrashin</i></b>, 1986. For the Filipino film title adaptations, the popular songs were used not only as a means to boost the careers of the pop artists who sang the movie themes but also as a marketing strategy to sell the film and the CD soundtrack that came with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Film Music, 2000 to Present</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The advancements in digital film at the start of the millennium pose more opportunities not only for independent filmmakers but for film music composers as well. With independent production comes more freedom in creative expression, versatility, and innovation in the use of sound and music apparatus, especially since the members of the film crew are no longer under the watchful eyes and control of a mainstream production studio. There is no need to create a contrived film narrative that could match a foreign or local pop hit, and the film scorer can focus on his/her individual artistic freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Composers and musicians who are products of independent film festivals, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\">Cinema One Originals</a>, and other independent productions contribute to the growing list of film scorers. With the available technology, these composers have become more daring, experimenting with the different permutations of sound and instrumentation and allowing them further diversity and variation in the creation of film sound tracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4287\">Teresa Barrozo</a>&rsquo;s film score for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1206\"><strong>Kinatay</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Execution of P.</i></b>), 2009, won at Sitges Catalonian International Film Festival for Best Original Soundtrack and demonstrated her prowess in revealing the character&rsquo;s gradual mental torment through the use of a metal pad decay&rsquo;s sharpness and thinness, and an oboe&rsquo;s glissando. Diwa de Leon&rsquo;s work in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1136\"><strong>Busong</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>Palawan Fate</i></b>), 2011, offered a fresh and crisp dimension to Filipino indigenous instruments such as the mouth harp and native flute when he used them to accompany the main character Punay as she embarked on a journey to find a cure for her mysterious affliction. Francis de Veyra&rsquo;s music in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a></i> </b>(Tribe), 2007, featured the rap culture in the ghetto district of Tondo, Manila. The poetic street rhythms and amateur beatboxing dialogued with the danger and adrenaline rush of the proliferation of Tondo&rsquo;s gang wars and petty crimes. Francis Reyes collaborated with musicians Jett Pangan (lead vocalist of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\">The Dawn</a>) and Buddy Zabala to create the soundtrack of <b><i>Tulad ng Dati</i></b> (<b><i>Just Like Before</i></b>), 2006, which featured the songs of the famous 1990s band The Dawn. The film used a semidocumentary format and revolved around the Filipino rock band&rsquo;s members, central of which was Jett Pangan&rsquo;s character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popong Landero, a composer and actor from Mindanao, did the music for <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1182\"><strong>Hunghong sa Yuta</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i><strong>Earth</strong> &rsquo;s Whisper</i></b>), 2008. Landero&rsquo;s music explored the vestiges of war. The deafening sounds of guns and grenades destroyed the hearing of the children living in the remote town of Hinyok. Somehow, music allowed for the articulation of these children who spoke using only hand gestures. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a>&rsquo;s work in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1146\"><strong>Ang Damgo ni Eleuteria</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Dream of Eleuteria</i></b>), 2010, accentuated the film&rsquo;s landscape, Olango Island, where Eleuteria was sent off by an entourage of townspeople as she slowly, and eventually, accepted her fate as a mail-order bride. Emerzon Texon&rsquo;s music in <b><i><strong>Sonata</strong> </i></b>, 2013, delved into an opera singer&rsquo;s loss of voice, which led to the decline in her career and her self-destructive tendencies. In between the classical tunes and string melodies, she found redemption in her friendship with a kind boy from her hometown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The development in sound technology was crucial in the transitions in Philippine film music and sound. The variations in the reverberation levels and quality of sound and music in films, the types of microphones used over the decades, the differences in methods of recording sound, and the diversities in mixing practices, all contributed to the work of the film scorer and the audience&rsquo;s reception of the film music and sound. Technology allowed for a more polished and crisp sound color and quality, which gave leverage and freedom to the scorer and sound designer to explore more potentials in film scoring. The early decades dealt with the issue of matching reverberation quality to specific scenes or spaces. Thus the playback system was developed, which was a way to record the music separately in a conducive atmosphere to come up with the illusion that the sound was created by the image, where in fact, it was independent from it. From the playback system, some film scorers in the latter decades (1990s to present) also experimented with the use of live music in the film scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beginning 1990s, contemporary film and sound studios use more advanced and sophisticated sound engineering equipment. With the different computer music programs available for free download or purchase such as Audacity, Logic Pro, and LinuxSampler, the film scorer is now able to manipulate how sound and music can be designed and how these elements can effectively shape the viewers&rsquo; understanding of visual images on the screen. It is now easier for the scorer to fuse diegetic and non-diegetic sound and music, with a clarity and smoothness of transition and flow. Technology has also paved the way for higher quality of music embedded in, or accompanied by, soundscapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Film composer Teresa Barrozo explained that the collaboration between a film composer and a sound designer is important because with the designer&rsquo;s mastery of the sound equipment, he or she can create the specific, high-quality sound or tone needed by the composer to accompany his or her music. When she worked on the music for the film <b><i>Kinatay</i></b>, the drone sound produced from the sound designer&rsquo;s end effectively complemented the glissando sound created by her oboe instrumentation. She also added that a film composer&rsquo;s music composition is not realized until it is tested and implemented into a concrete sound space; in this aspect, the sound designer and sound engineer aid in maximizing the use of technology to further enhance the composer&rsquo;s creation, thus delivering an enriched and heightened multisensory experience for the listener/audience (Barrozo 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The use of computer music programs also gives the scorer flexibility and can prove to be more cost-efficient most of the time, compared to live studio film music recording. An example of which is producing a full orchestra track, without the need to hire an actual orchestra. The downside of this, however, is the possible lack of authenticity in sound as it is a mere sampling of the instruments. Thus some scorers still opt for the actual orchestra, quartet, or band, and live recording, instead of relying on the computer programs, so as not to sacrifice the quality and original timbre of the required music or sound for the film.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3918\"><strong>Jose S.

The show was accompanied by music provided by a guitarist under maestro Francisco P. de Barbat. The next year, 1898, Antonio Ramos, a Spanish military officer from Barcelona presented his own program of films, including those that he himself had shot in the Philippines, like <b><i>Escenas Callejeras</i></b> (Street Scenes), <b><i>Fiesta de Quiapo </i></b>(Quiapo Fiesta), and <b><i>Panorama de Manila</i></b> (Manila Panorama). Ramos is considered the first person to shoot a film in Manila. In 1905, Herbert Wyndham of the Edison Biograph also shot scenes in the Manila Fire Department (Sotto 1992, 5-6)."

But because they could not yet compete with the sarsuwela, which was the dominant genre of public entertainment, films rode on the popularity of the form. Thus, in 1906, the Cinematografo-Teatro Cervantes showed films as enticers, front acts, or divertissements to <a href=\"/7/60/2936\">Praxedes Fernandez</a>&#x2019;s zarzuela, <b><i>Sensitiva</i></b>. In the advertisement for this zarzuela, the titles of films were not even announced, manifesting their low value compared to the main entertainment. Besides, up until 1909, only a limited number of films, mainly those from Pathe in France, were shown in Manila again and again, and so the medium quickly lost its novelty."

				"value": "The orchestras for film were small chamber music ensembles, similar or identical to those that played in the sarsuwela. From 1902 to 1910, musicians involved in accompanying films were <a href=\"/5/42/3979\">Jose Estella</a>, with the Rizal orchestra quintet, at the Cinematografo-Teatro Nuevo Cervantes in 1905; Pedro Madariaga who directed music for the Gran Cinematografo Filipino in 1905 and the Gran Cinematografo del Oriente in 1906; <a href=\"/5/42/3847\">Bonifacio Abdon</a>, with Sexteto Orquesta Rizal, at the Gran Cinematografo-Teatro Cervantes in 1906; Manuel Egea who was in the Gran Teatro-Cinematografo Libertad; and Jose Vedal and Henri Niviere at the Walgraph. Except for Estella, a Filipino whose career was already well established in Manila, it was the foreign musicians who dominated the exhibition and marketing of film entertainment in Philippine cities. After Pedro Madariaga left the Gran Cinematografo del Oriente, <a href=\"/5/42/3917\">Francisco Buencamino</a>&#xA0;replaced him as the director of the orchestra. Estella, Abdon, and Buencamino were therefore three of the important film music practitioners in early silent films. From them, the next generation of urban Filipino musicians, such as piano players <a href=\"/5/42/4163\">Francisco Santiago</a> and <a href=\"/5/42/3849\">Nicanor Abelardo</a>, would learn how to eke out a living by playing the piano to accompany silent films."

What is clear, however, is that music was still just an arbitrary accessory to the images because music was performed ad hoc and was external to its production; it was added later in real time and was not part of the making of the film product. The repertory of music in silent films came from different foreign sources; but as years went by, local music must have been used more and more. Evidence of many extant collections of semiclassical music for small ensembles and piano albums from the period, many of which had simplified arrangements of popular classical music, would seem to prove that film musicians were quite equipped to tackle the wide range of moods and sentiments embodied in the projected images and narratives."

Scoring, which appropriated canned music, was made through phonographs and records when these became available beginning 1910. Some theater owners utilized gramophones to substitute for live music performance in order to fill in the aural vacuum in silent films and to save up on the cost of employing live musicians."

However, phonographs were fragile machines with tiny sounds and not as reliable as <a href=\"/5/37/822\">pianos</a> whose industrial cast-iron strength and versatility were unmatched by any other instrument. In some cases, the songs that were supposed to be performed by actors on-screen were dubbed live by actors who sang behind the screen, in sync with the screen images. In <a href=\"/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>&#x2019;s production of <b><i><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong> </i></b> (Country Maiden), a film adaptation of the highly successful <a href=\"/7/7/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>-<a href=\"/5/5/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"/7/58/535\">sarsuwela</a> of the same title in 1919, <a href=\"/7/60/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a><strong> </strong> herself came on stage to sing &#x201C;Nabasag ang Banga&#x201D; (The Claypot Broke) in sync with the movements of her own image on-screen."

Then American resident Albert Yearsley was said to be the first to produce films locally. These were mostly documentaries of local events and historical subjects. His sensational 20-minute fictional film on the death of Rizal titled <b><i>La Pasion y Muerte de Dr. Rizal</i></b> (The Passion and Death of Dr Rizal), alternately called <b><i>El Fusilamiento de Dr. <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </i></b> (The Execution of Dr <a href=\"/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>), was hurriedly shot in 1912 to compete with the American tandem of Harry Brown and Edward Meyer Gross who were going to screen in the same month the hour-long <b><i>La Vida de Jose Rizal</i></b> (The Life of Jose Rizal). What types of music accompanied these two Rizal films are not known, but by that time, there were already numerous pieces of music commemorating Rizal&#x2019;s death and heroism that musicians could choose from. Later on, American films that were locally produced depicted cultural practices like the pilgrimage to Antipolo, which both Yearsley and Brown-Gross produced."

There were no hard-and-fast rules on how the necessary piano music supplement could be realized in theater.

The matching of the characters&#x2019; identities and musical styles are apt and convincing. Well-thought-out is the imaginary scene showing the blind old man, the father of Jose who belonged to the peasant class and therefore more suited to be Guia&#x2019;s partner, playing an instrument of the poor, a bamboo cello or <em>musikong bumbong</em>. In this scene, the blind old man is hearing an extradiegetic music, as if telepresencing his auditors, the moviegoers, who are outside the screen&#x2019;s reality. What is remarkable in this scene is that it happens at around the time when the hacienda owners are listening to the voice of country girl Guia via the cosmopolitan radio, thus producing a parallelism, a poignant layering that mirrors what the old man is hearing. The intelligent musical plan in the scene clearly manifests Silos&#x2019;s sensitivity to the difference between diegetic and extradiegetic music."

This song is the theme song of the movie, so to speak. In a romantic scene when Ernesto, the landlord&#x2019;s son, disguises himself as a peasant so he can approach Amparing in the fields, the danza <a href=\"/5/40/874\">&quot;Buhat,&quot;</a>&#xA0;one of Velarde&#x2019;s most beloved songs, captures beautifully the coquettish lightness of the first encounter between the soon-to-be lovers. In <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b>, the unwed mother named Magdalena (named after the biblical figure) intones the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in Latin as a song of mourning&#x2014;a funeral song in front of the tomb of her father. Oppressed by conservative patriarchal values, Magdalena has to relinquish her motherly right to raise an illegitimate daughter to protect her family&#x2019;s honor. The song expresses the pain of her subjection to a cruel social world, which she cannot transcend.

In these song-and-dance numbers, one feels a manifestation of a distinctly Filipino sensibility. They have no counterpart elsewhere because they are rooted in the tradition of the indigenized sarsuwela.

The function of the extradiegetic music to articulate the dramatic element is important, and it is this function that moves the story to action and suspense, thereby generating the film&#x2019;s energy and intensity. Except for <b><i>Giliw Ko</i></b>, the films rely heavily on stock musical formulas or canned music in most of their extradiegetic music in rendering dramatic scenes. In <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, for example, Bach&#x2019;s <em><strong>Air in G</strong> </em> is used to simply fill in the passage of time as the distraught Amparing tries to borrow money that she needs to bail out her imprisoned father. The effect of this appropriated music is static, for it simply judges Amparing to be already pitiable and does not draw in the audience to increasing empathy. In <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>, the horse chase depicting Juan abducting Maria and bringing her to his kingdom is accompanied by the orchestra playing the clich&#xE9;d passage of 16 notes from Rossini&#x2019;s <em><strong>William Tell Overture</strong> </em>.In the next scene, while Maria stays in an inn, dialogues are backgrounded, as in melodrama, with inert appropriated&#x2014;even ballet-like&#x2014;symphonic music coming from a played-back sound recording machine that does not relate in any way to the emotional cues of danger and anxiety that Maria is facing. Canned extradiegetic music is all the more glaring in <b><i>Tunay na Ina</i></b> where it is used, as in <b><i>Pakiusap</i></b>, as a melodramatic filler, thus failing to make the audience understand the complex dramatic emotions that Magdalena as a mother has to struggle with vis-&#xE0;-vis the loss of her daughter&#x2014;that is, between her biological instinct to care for her and the cruel and unjust patriarchally ordered social world that took her daughter away from her."

On the other, this kind of scoring may have been influenced by the formulaic melodramatic music of soap operas of radio programs that had to cut down on the high cost of composing and recording original scores. Canned music was to survive many more decades and was even evident in the best dramatic films that the Philippines had made during the 1970s and 1980s."

The tradition of theater and entertainment from American musicals and vaudeville became staples for many films during this era. The primary studios then&#x2014;LVN Pictures, Sampaguita Pictures, and <a href=\"/4/26/4606\">Premiere Productions</a> (founded 1946)&#x2014;mostly came up with films that provided escape for the audience. Thus production numbers, songs, and dances, just like the musical stage shows in the old Manila opera houses, were integrated into the film narratives. LVN&#x2019;s producer Do&#xF1;a Narcisa Buencamino de Leon, or Do&#xF1;a Sisang to her colleagues, opted to produce films based on metrical romances such as <a href=\"/4/24/1163\"><b><i><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</i></b></a><i> </i>(Florante and Laura), 1939; <b><i>Ibong Adarna</i></b>, 1941 and 1955; and <b><i>Doce Pares</i></b><i> </i>(Twelve Pairs), 1954. Correspondingly, the type of music and soundtrack used in these films accompanied the dances and movements required by the film genre, while traditional music, folk songs, kundiman music, and Spanish-influenced music filled the aural atmosphere of the films. The acoustic texture also coincided with the producer&#x2019;s vision to portray Filipino countryside life and tradition through the music and dances. In the film <b><i>Barrio Fiesta</i></b>, 1959, the effervescence of the festivities was expressed through a merriment of guitar tunes and songs, and playful frenzy between the ladies and the men from the barrio."

This is a film reminiscent not of the festive music of the town&#x2019;s celebration but of the rhythm produced by the pounding of a mortar and pestle which uniquely transitioned from a diegetic sound to non-diegetic, depicting the lives of people from the countryside. Another one of his works was the score for <strong><a href=\"/4/24/1104\"><i>Anak Dalita</i></a></strong> (<i>The Ruins</i>), 1956, a film portraying the plight of the impoverished, which was a complete departure from the usually cheerful song-and-dance movie theme.

The film&#x2019;s opening scene sets the mood for the entire film&#x2014;a vivacious production number with characters singing and dancing in the rain, not like Gene Kelly&#x2019;s and Debbie Reynold&#x2019;s stylized version but capturing local color, complete with Manila&#x2019;s enormous puddles and hopeful teens hoping for a cancellation of classes. <b><i>I Do Bidoo Bidoo: Heto nAPO Sila!</i></b><i> </i>starts with a medley of songs from the <a href=\"/5/42/3868\">Apo Hiking Society</a>, the pop trio with the longest staying power in the country. The film is a scrapbook of pop music, gaudy costumes, and color splattered across the backdrop of Manila&#x2019;s bustle, its streets, landmarks, and daily commute. The images alternate with the medley&#x2019;s vibrancy and the flamboyance of the characters, which include a young couple expecting a child and are torn between their respective families."

Same tunes were carved from the main theme song and spread out as fragments of music throughout the film&#x2019;s scenes, using a variety of instrumentations. This could have helped create a musical leitmotif for a specific character or space, but the repetitive tunes simply added to the recall of the theme song, instead of creating a tenuous synchronization of image and sound."

Some examples include <b><i>Till There Was You</i></b>, 2003, produced by <a href=\"/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a> and <b><i>Let the Love Begin</i></b>, 2005, produced by GMA Films. &#x201C;Till There Was You,&#x201D; a song written by Meredith Wilson in 1957, was also the title of a 1997 Hollywood romantic comedy film, produced by Lakeshore Entertainment and directed by Scott Winant. &#x201C;Let the Love Begin&#x201D; was written by Gloria Sklerov and Lenny Macaluso and was also used as a theme for the American movie <b><i>Thrashin</i></b>, 1986. For the Filipino film title adaptations, the popular songs were used not only as a means to boost the careers of the pop artists who sang the movie themes but also as a marketing strategy to sell the film and the CD soundtrack that came with it."

Diwa de Leon&#x2019;s work in <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1136\"><strong>Busong</strong></a></i> </b>(<b><i>Palawan Fate</i></b>), 2011, offered a fresh and crisp dimension to Filipino indigenous instruments such as the mouth harp and native flute when he used them to accompany the main character Punay as she embarked on a journey to find a cure for her mysterious affliction. Francis de Veyra&#x2019;s music in <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a></i> </b>(Tribe), 2007, featured the rap culture in the ghetto district of Tondo, Manila. The poetic street rhythms and amateur beatboxing dialogued with the danger and adrenaline rush of the proliferation of Tondo&#x2019;s gang wars and petty crimes. Francis Reyes collaborated with musicians Jett Pangan (lead vocalist of <a href=\"/5/42/3957\">The Dawn</a>) and Buddy Zabala to create the soundtrack of <b><i>Tulad ng Dati</i></b> (<b><i>Just Like Before</i></b>), 2006, which featured the songs of the famous 1990s band The Dawn. The film used a semidocumentary format and revolved around the Filipino rock band&#x2019;s members, central of which was Jett Pangan&#x2019;s character."

Landero&#x2019;s music explored the vestiges of war. The deafening sounds of guns and grenades destroyed the hearing of the children living in the remote town of Hinyok.

Emerzon Texon&#x2019;s music in <b><i><strong>Sonata</strong> </i></b>, 2013, delved into an opera singer&#x2019;s loss of voice, which led to the decline in her career and her self-destructive tendencies.

				"value": "The development in sound technology was crucial in the transitions in Philippine film music and sound. The variations in the reverberation levels and quality of sound and music in films, the types of microphones used over the decades, the differences in methods of recording sound, and the diversities in mixing practices, all contributed to the work of the film scorer and the audience&#x2019;s reception of the film music and sound. Technology allowed for a more polished and crisp sound color and quality, which gave leverage and freedom to the scorer and sound designer to explore more potentials in film scoring. The early decades dealt with the issue of matching reverberation quality to specific scenes or spaces. Thus the playback system was developed, which was a way to record the music separately in a conducive atmosphere to come up with the illusion that the sound was created by the image, where in fact, it was independent from it. From the playback system, some film scorers in the latter decades (1990s to present) also experimented with the use of live music in the film scenes."

It is now easier for the scorer to fuse diegetic and non-diegetic sound and music, with a clarity and smoothness of transition and flow.

When she worked on the music for the film <b><i>Kinatay</i></b>, the drone sound produced from the sound designer&#x2019;s end effectively complemented the glissando sound created by her oboe instrumentation. She also added that a film composer&#x2019;s music composition is not realized until it is tested and implemented into a concrete sound space; in this aspect, the sound designer and sound engineer aid in maximizing the use of technology to further enhance the composer&#x2019;s creation, thus delivering an enriched and heightened multisensory experience for the listener/audience (Barrozo 2015)."

				"value": "The use of computer music programs also gives the scorer flexibility and can prove to be more cost-efficient most of the time, compared to live studio film music recording. An example of which is producing a full orchestra track, without the need to hire an actual orchestra. The downside of this, however, is the possible lack of authenticity in sound as it is a mere sampling of the instruments. Thus some scorers still opt for the actual orchestra, quartet, or band, and live recording, instead of relying on the computer programs, so as not to sacrifice the quality and original timbre of the required music or sound for the film.&#xA0;<span class>&#xA0;</span> "

While most of them are of a voluntary or nongovernment nature, they vary according to the purpose for which they are established. There are associations of film artists and technicians whose goals are to institute training and development, promote professionalism, and recognize excellence in members&rsquo; achievements. There are associations formed to protect common interests, acting as a powerful lobby against various threats to the well-being of their members. There are associations of movie writers and film critics that seek to foster and elevate the cinema to the level of art and meaningful cultural expression. And there are also independent film outfits and collectives that produce and offer alternative films outside mainstream productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1950s, the Big Four movie producers&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4508\">Lebran</a>&mdash;organized the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4597\">Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association (PMPA)</a>. One of the requirements for membership in the PMPA was ownership and maintenance of a studio. Consequently, other producers who merely leased studio facilities and equipment could not get into the association. The situation drastically changed in the 1960s when import controls on raw stock and film equipment were lifted, thus giving way to decontrol. Anyone who had the means to buy raw film stock could purchase it anywhere: Eastman Kodak from the United States, Fuji from Japan, Ilford from England, and Agfa from Germany. The PMPA revised its policies and opened its doors to the other film producers. Many movie stars who turned producers swelled the ranks of the association, among the new outfits being FPJ, Virgo, RVQ, JE, and AM Films. The PMPA was renamed Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association (PMPPA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By 1981 the original Big Four were no longer active in movie production: Lebran had bowed out early in 1957, LVN concentrated on its color film laboratory, while Sampaguita and Premiere opted to provide postproduction services to the industry. Sampaguita, LVN, and Premiere, however, still hold honorary membership status in the present PMPPA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another organization of producers and importers has since been established, the Integrated Movie Producers, Importers, and Distributors Association of the Philippines (IMPIDAP). It is composed mostly of theater owners and film importers even if two of its more prominent members, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\"><strong>Regal Films</strong></a> and Seiko Films, have become associated with local film production. The IMPIDAP numbers over 70 members who are consistently represented in film festivals and film marketing activities here and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, attempts were made to band film workers together in such organizations as the Motion Picture Guild of the Philippines, Philippine Motion Picture Workers Association, Cinema Workers Union of the Philippines, Premiere Productions Workers Union (PPWU), and Motion Picture Workers Union. The PPWU figured in a labor strike, which eventually led to the closure of Premiere Productions studio and the collapse of the studio system. But it was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\">Movie Workers Welfare Foundation Inc (Mowelfund)</a> that proved viable among these workers&rsquo; groups. Since its establishment in 1974 by actor-producer turned Philippine president JosephEstrada, Mowelfund has provided welfare assistance to its less fortunate members and their dependents/beneficiaries in the form of medical services, hospitalization, and death insurance. Its educational arm, the Mowelfund Film Institute, provides the necessary funds, equipment, expertise, and scholarship for the continuing development of a wider base of filmmakers through training programs, seminars, and workshops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the craft-oriented guilds, the two oldest are the cinematographers&rsquo; guild and the film editors&rsquo; guild. The former was earlier known as the Philippine Society of Cinematographers. In 1952, it was already listed in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a>&rsquo;s book, <b><i>Motion</i></b> <b><i>Pictures in the Philippines</i></b>, as among the oldest associations of film professionals in the country. Later, it changed its name to Filipino Society of Cinematographers. From its ranks have emerged movie directors and filmmakers, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4601\">Ben Pinga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4711\">Dik Trofeo</a>, and the late <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4645\">Emmanuel Rojas</a> who worked with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a> before becoming a movie director himself. The editors&rsquo; guild was formerly known as the Film Editors&rsquo; Union of the Philippines. It originally started as a union of film artisans out to protect the rights of its members by way of standardizing fees and adhering to acceptable working conditions. In 1981 it opted to become the Filipino Editors Guild for Motion Pictures (FEGMP), but it continues to regard itself as a labor union with economic matters receiving highest priority. It has over a hundred members composed of full editors, assistant film editors, and a number of apprentices or trainees. The members generally work as a team: a chief editor, one or two assistant editors, a negative cutter, and an apprentice or trainee who does the work of a joiner. The FEGMP has an organized secretariat that attends to its members&rsquo; needs, including working conditions and wages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4438\">Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP)</a> is the biggest organization in the cinema industry. Established by a presidential decree in 1981, it is an umbrella organization set up purposely to oversee the activities of the major guilds, associations, and institutions in the Philippine film industry. To date there are 14 autonomous, independent groups composing the FAP: Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association; Integrated Movie Producers, Importers, and Distributors Association of the Philippines; Kapisanan ng mga Direktor ng Pelikulang Pilipino; Katipunan ng mga Artista ng Pelikulang Pilipino; Screenwriters Guild of the Philippines; Filipino Society of Cinematographers; Filipino Editors Guild for Motion Pictures; Sound Technicians Association for Motion Pictures; United Film Music Directors Association of the Philippines; Production Designers Guild of the Philippines; Assistant Directors and Production Managers Guild; Movie Workers Welfare Foundation Inc; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4244\">Actors Workshop Foundation</a>; and Organization of Specialized Filipino Filmmakers (OSFILM).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The youngest guild in the FAP is OSFILM. It was organized by Ben Pinga and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a> in 1989 to help develop and train young filmmakers. With the entry of OSFILM into the FAP, the country&rsquo;s young filmmakers have gained some recognition from their co-practitioners in mainstream cinema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1991, months after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>&rsquo;s death, a breakaway organization from the Kapisanan ng mga Direktor ng mga Pelikulang Pilipino was formed due to some internal conflicts. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>, later National Artist for Film, and several prominent film directors became instrumental in formalizing the Directors Guild of the Philippines Incorporated (DGPI).

The GMTA is known as the Roces-Rufino group and includes owners/operators of Avenue, Lyric, State, Ideal, Ever, Quezon, Quad, Remar, Maxim, Miramar, Roxan, Roben, Act, Luneta, Delta, Circle, Odeon, and Makati Cinema Square. The MMTA is known as the Tama-Monteverde group, which has Gotesco, Universal, Capri, Ali Mall, New Frontier, New Love, Galaxy, Dilson, Dynasty, Ocean, Sampaguita, Virra Mall, and Greenbelt Cinema. A third theater association, the Kapisanan ng mga Sinehan sa Pilipinas, is nationwide in scope. Some of its theaters belong to the association known as the Motion Pictures Export Association of America, composed of foreign film exchanges operating in the Philippines, like Paramount, Warner Bros, M-G-M, Universal, 20th Century Fox, and United Artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside the film industry are the movie press clubs, film critics organizations, and other award-giving bodies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences (FAMAS)</a> is the oldest award-giving body in the country.

One of the requirements for membership in the PMPA was ownership and maintenance of a studio. Consequently, other producers who merely leased studio facilities and equipment could not get into the association. The situation drastically changed in the 1960s when import controls on raw stock and film equipment were lifted, thus giving way to decontrol. Anyone who had the means to buy raw film stock could purchase it anywhere: Eastman Kodak from the United States, Fuji from Japan, Ilford from England, and Agfa from Germany. The PMPA revised its policies and opened its doors to the other film producers. Many movie stars who turned producers swelled the ranks of the association, among the new outfits being FPJ, Virgo, RVQ, JE, and AM Films. The PMPA was renamed Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association (PMPPA)."

The editors&#x2019; guild was formerly known as the Film Editors&#x2019; Union of the Philippines. It originally started as a union of film artisans out to protect the rights of its members by way of standardizing fees and adhering to acceptable working conditions. In 1981 it opted to become the Filipino Editors Guild for Motion Pictures (FEGMP), but it continues to regard itself as a labor union with economic matters receiving highest priority. It has over a hundred members composed of full editors, assistant film editors, and a number of apprentices or trainees. The members generally work as a team: a chief editor, one or two assistant editors, a negative cutter, and an apprentice or trainee who does the work of a joiner. The FEGMP has an organized secretariat that attends to its members&#x2019; needs, including working conditions and wages."

Film production encompasses three stages: <b>preproduction</b>, <b>principal photography</b>, and <b>postproduction</b>. Each phase is separate from the other although their activities may overlap in the course of movie production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Preproduction involves the acquisition of the rights to the material (story, play, historical account, etc.) to be filmed, the appointment of a director who will be on top of the whole process of production, the writing of the screenplay or scenario treatment, as well as budgeting, casting, location hunting, building of sets, and preparing props, costumes, and special effects. All contracts and negotiations for services of other talents and personnel, as well as rentals of equipment and studio facilities, are finalized in the preproduction stage. When 35 mm film was the format for filmmaking, the availability of film stock and laboratory services had to be ensured to avoid delays during film production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Transportation must be arranged, not only to deliver equipment and personnel to the location but also to retrieve equipment, and the like. Location filming includes both interior and exterior shooting. Permits are usually required in certain locations and should therefore be obtained in advance. Police clearance might also be needed in some circumstances. Provisions must be made for transportation, food, and lodging for production personnel. For big scenes that require more than one camera, an extra shooting unit may be contracted for in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The kind of budget a film gets usually depends on the type of film as well as the bankability of its stars. Aside from the director&rsquo;s fees and those for the principal cast and supporting players, items such as wages, overhead, transportation, overtime, insurance, copyright fees and other clearances, music rights, library stock footage, and special effects like prosthetics must be budgeted accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Principal photography is also known as production proper. This is the actual shooting phase of the film production. It begins with the first &ldquo;take&rdquo; on the set and ends with a &ldquo;wrap&rdquo; or &ldquo;pack up&rdquo; on the final shooting day. Upon completion of the principal photography phase, the shooting unit&rsquo;s work is done but the other film personnel may still be involved in postproduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Postproduction refers to activities that include editing, sound transfers, sound effects, dubbing, and mixing. When film was the raw stock, a lot of laboratory work was done during postproduction, including optical transfers and the final processing that produces the composite mix. This traditional process ended with the &ldquo;marrying&rdquo; of sound and picture in one film negative, from which copies were made for distribution and exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The main person in charge is the <b>producer</b>. In the Philippines, the producer of a film may be any one or all of the following: the owner of a movie company, the investor or financier of a movie production, the highest executive in a multimedia company who is specifically in charge of the entertainment art and/or its most dominant platforms, the individual who makes the necessary arrangements for the making of a film or motion picture, or the person who is accountable for the success or failure of the movie in terms of box-office receipts and/or critical acclaim. Often, two or more of these functions are handled by one person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Those who assist the investor of a film are the following. The <b>executive producer</b> is the individual in charge of the finances of the film from its moment of inception to development. He or she is the officer entrusted by the producer to ensure proper budgeting, disbursement, and even designing marketing strategies to put together and sell the film. The <b>supervising producer</b> is the conduit between the executive producer and the <b>line producer</b>. He or she is usually given the task of following through the project from inception to postproduction. The line producer is given a budget to deliver the film from preproduction until the finalization of the producer&rsquo;s cut. He or she answers to the supervising and executive producers and must ensure that the movie&rsquo;s quality is maintained while keeping within the budget. The <b>associate producer</b> works hand in hand with the line producer. He or she assists in the negotiations for below-the-line talents, technical and creative crew; helps prepare the budget; and coordinates with the production manager and postproduction coordinator. In the Philippine cinematic setting, however, the distinctions among these positions and occupations become blurred for practical and economic reasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although it is the <b>director</b> who dominates the entire filmmaking process from conceptualization to postproduction, it is the wishes of the producer that are carried out to the final cut. The hand that guides it all along the way is the director&rsquo;s, but the producer retains the authority to revise the director&rsquo;s work, either by ordering cures (changes) after seeing the daily rushes, or by taking control of the final cutting and assembly of the workprint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early days of cinema in the Philippines, the producer was also the director of the movie. The pioneer Filipino producers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4526\">Julian Manansala</a> bought or prepared scripts, hired artists and technicians, and themselves acted some parts, designed sets, and handled cameras as well as editing and laboratory equipment. They generally attended to all the details of production aside from directing the actual shooting scenes. As the industry progressed, the need to expand the territory of manpower to include other people in the preparation, production, and distribution of films also became apparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the advent of the talkies and the rise of movie studios, what had been a craft took on some of the trappings of an industrial enterprise. Producers like George Harris and Edward Tait, Nepomuceno&rsquo;s American partners in the first Filipino all-talking film, <strong><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1270\">Punyal na Ginto</a></i></strong> <i> </i>(Golden Dagger), 1933, hired directors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4704\">Carlos Vander Tolosa</a> to make movies for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\">Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</a>, Nepomuceno started the trend of hiring a production manager to oversee studio operations. He convinced silent film producer Vicente Salumbides to come out of retirement and take charge of production at Parlatone. After his stint with Parlatone, Salumbides formed his own company, Salumbides Film Company Ltd, and produced the memorable classic <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1163\"><i>Florante at Laura</i></a></strong> <i> </i>(Florante and Laura), 1939. Another producer whom Nepomuceno trained as production manager was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4574\">Luis F. Nolasco</a>, who later organized Nolasco Bros. Pictures and produced <b><i><strong>Fort Santiago</strong> </i></b>,<i> </i>1946, and <b><i><strong>Siete Dolores</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Seven Sorrows), 1948.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was Nolasco who spurred Rep Pedro Vera to establish <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures</a> in 1937, bringing with him such big names as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4577\">Elsa Oria</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\">Mike Velarde</a>, and Carlos Vander Tolosa. A year later, Do&ntilde;a Sisang Buencamino de Leon established <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a>. By 1940, Filipino movies had become a mass entertainment phenomenon, attracting more investors and financiers who assumed the role of industrial film producer. J. Amado Araneta, who bought out Harris and Tait&rsquo;s shares in Filippine Films after the Americans bowed out of movie production, expanded the concept of industrial film producer by bringing into the fold an assorted group of movie directors ranging from politicians and journalists like Nick Osme&ntilde;a and Hermenegildo Atienza to playwrights and theater personalities like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a>. The concept of a director as filmmaker&mdash;that is, one whose involvement in the making of films is creative rather than business-oriented&mdash;evolved with this group. This is seen in some of the movies produced by Filippine Films before the outbreak of the Pacific War: Avellana&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1275\"><b><i>Sakay</i></b></a>,<i> </i>1939; Atienza&rsquo;s <b><i>Hating Gabi</i></b><i> </i>(Midnight), 1940; and Osme&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <b><i>Magdalena</i></b>,<i> </i>1941.<i> </i>Respect for the director as creative filmmaker was<i> </i>the principal concern of Dr Ciriaco Santiago when he established Premiere Productions in 1946. His studio<i> </i>gave the director more latitude, autonomy, and cinematic freedom. Premiere became the home of such outstanding directors as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4450\">Cesar Gallardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4580\">Consuelo P. Osorio</a>, and the late National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leo <strong>n</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Movie stars who achieve a certain degree of stature in the industry can become producers of their own picture and exercise total control over the production. Rogelio de la Rosa was among the first to do this when he left Sampaguita to form RDR Productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\">Fernando Poe Sr</a> also pioneered in setting up his own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4656\">Royal Productions</a>, which made such films as the war epic <b><i>Dugo ng Bayan</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>I Remember Bataan</i></b>), 1946, and the fantasy film, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong> </i></b>,<i> </i>1951. Following his death in 1951, his son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr</a> became an actor and eventually set up his own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4444\">FPJ Productions</a>, which became one of the country&rsquo;s major film companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the actor-director-producers, the most successful are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a> with his <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1167\"><strong>Genghis Khan</strong></a></i></b>, 1950, and Juan Tamad<i> </i>series; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4643\">Eddie Rodriguez</a> with his love-triangle dramas like <b><i>Kapag Puso&rsquo;y Sinugatan</i></b><i> </i>(When the Heart Is Wounded), 1967, and <b><i>Ang Padrino </i></b>(The Godfather), 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The list of successful <b>actor-producers</b> include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> (JE Productions and Emar Pictures), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\">Dolphy</a> (RVQ Productions), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4626\">Ramon Revilla</a> (Imus Productions), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\">Susan Roces</a> (Rosas Productions), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4447\">Amalia Fuentes</a> (AM Productions), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> (NV Productions), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\">Vilma Santos</a> (VS Films), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a> (Sotang Bastos Productions), Lisa Moreno (Virgo Productions), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4725\">Vivian Velez</a> (Amazaldy Films), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4502\">Lito Lapid</a> (LL Productions), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\">Armida Siguion-Reyna</a> (Reyna Films), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4672\">Charo Santos</a> (Vision Films), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4433\">Rudy Fernandez</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4703\">Lorna Tolentino</a> (Reflection Films). Their more successful efforts have resulted in movies that won critical acclaim or at least set box-office records: Emar&rsquo;s <b><i>Ito ang Filipino</i></b><i> </i>(Behold the Filipino), 1966; FPJ&rsquo;s <b><i>Asedillo</i></b>,<i> </i>1971; Imus&rsquo;s <b><i>Nardong</i> <i>Putik</i></b>,<i> </i>1972; NV&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1300\"><strong>Tatlong Taong Walang Diyos</strong></a></i> </b>(<em><strong>Three Godless Years</strong></em>), 1976; JE&rsquo;s <b><i><strong>Bakya Mo Neneng</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Your Wooden Slippers, Neneng), 1977; VS&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1260\"><b><i>Pagputi ng Uwak, Pag-itim ng Tagak </i></b></a>(<em><strong>When the Crow Turns White, When the Heron Turns Black</strong></em>), 1978; and Rosas&rsquo;s <b><i>Gumising Ka &hellip; Maruja</i></b><i> </i>(Wake Up &hellip; Maruja), 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before their assimilation into the Philippine Movie Producers Association (PMPA), these producers were known as <b>indies</b> or <b>independent producers</b>, which in movie parlance was the opposite of major. The indies made only one or two pictures a year against the major producer&rsquo;s dozen or more films. They did not own movie studios or equipment but only rented facilities and shooting units, and they did not have stars on exclusive long-term contracts. But the number of the indies grew so that, sometime in the 1960s, the PMPA was changed to the Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association to accommodate them all. Membership swelled from the original Big Four to more than 40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Producers often have to contend with the dichotomy between art and popular entertainment, creativity and commerce. Faced with the question of survival in a highly competitive industry, director-producers choose to be pragmatic, putting commerce above creativity. But serious artists desiring greater freedom in their work tried to make the transition from director-filmmaker to director-filmmaker-producer. To this group belong producers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a> (Hemisphere Productions), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> (Cine Manila Corporation), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a> (Cinema Artists). Despite the many pitfalls that beset them as director-producers, they have produced such classics as <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1166\"><i>Ganito</i> <i>Kami Noon &hellip; Paano Kayo Ngayon?</i></a><i>&nbsp;</i></b>(<em><strong>This Was How We Were &hellip; What Happens to You Now?</strong></em>), 1976; <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1305\"><i>Tinimbang</i> </a><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1305\">Ka Ngunit Kulang</a> </i></b>(<em><strong>Weighed But Found Wanting</strong></em>), 1974; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><strong>Maynila: Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>Manila: In the Claws of Light</i></b>), 1975; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1193\"><strong>Itim</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>The Rites of May</i></b>), 1976.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The more successful producers who are neither stars nor directors have skills for conceiving viable film projects and marshalling the necessary resources. Jose R. Perez of Sampaguita, Marichu Maceda of MVP Pictures, Lily Monteverde of Regal, Jesse Ejercito of Crown Seven and Seven Stars, Espiridion Laxa of Tagalog Ilang-Ilang, Vic del Rosario of Viva, Robbie Tan of Seiko, Emilia Blas and Teodorica Santos of Lea, Orly Ilacad of OctoArts all belong to this group. Known as a star builder, Dr Perez transformed unknowns into outstanding movie personalities, among them <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4649\">Gloria Romero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4644\">Lolita Rodriguez</a>, Dolphy, Susan Roces, Amalia Fuentes, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4451\">Eddie Garcia</a>, and Nora Aunor. His achievement has been emulated by other producers like Monteverde, del Rosario, Tan, and later, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4909\">German Moreno</a> in television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1990s, trends in moviemaking among the major studios point to the importance of line producers. Where there is need to coordinate the mass production of films, a great bulk of the responsibility in the hands of the producer is relegated to line producers. As the producer&rsquo;s representatives, they see to it that important activities of filmmaking are undertaken only with their approval. The line producers think like producers, motivated by the commercial viability of a project and the need to meet the playdate. They keep the budget low with their direct involvement in the production: difficulties are foreseen and remedied early, and crippling delays are averted during production and postproduction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, the landscape of producing changed with the rise of power of the multimedia companies. When television became the most dominant medium, the whole landscape of film production in the Philippines changed. Whereas before there was a distinct difference between film and TV stars, the merging of the two media relegated the big screen as a feeder of content for the much wider and more encompassing television business. TV networks began to have their film production outfits to be able to provide movies to be shown in both their commercial as well as cable channels.

The <b>supervising producer</b> is the conduit between the executive producer and the <b>line producer</b>.

Producers like George Harris and Edward Tait, Nepomuceno&#x2019;s American partners in the first Filipino all-talking film, <strong><i><a href=\"/4/24/1270\">Punyal na Ginto</a></i></strong> <i> </i>(Golden Dagger), 1933, hired directors like <a href=\"/4/26/4684\">Manuel Silos</a> and <a href=\"/4/26/4704\">Carlos Vander Tolosa</a> to make movies for <a href=\"/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>. In <a href=\"/4/26/4589\">Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</a>, Nepomuceno started the trend of hiring a production manager to oversee studio operations. He convinced silent film producer Vicente Salumbides to come out of retirement and take charge of production at Parlatone. After his stint with Parlatone, Salumbides formed his own company, Salumbides Film Company Ltd, and produced the memorable classic <strong><a href=\"/4/24/1163\"><i>Florante at Laura</i></a></strong> <i> </i>(Florante and Laura), 1939. Another producer whom Nepomuceno trained as production manager was <a href=\"/4/26/4574\">Luis F. Nolasco</a>, who later organized Nolasco Bros. Pictures and produced <b><i><strong>Fort Santiago</strong> </i></b>,<i> </i>1946, and <b><i><strong>Siete Dolores</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Seven Sorrows), 1948."

A year later, Do&#xF1;a Sisang Buencamino de Leon established <a href=\"/4/26/4520\">LVN Pictures</a>. By 1940, Filipino movies had become a mass entertainment phenomenon, attracting more investors and financiers who assumed the role of industrial film producer. J. Amado Araneta, who bought out Harris and Tait&#x2019;s shares in Filippine Films after the Americans bowed out of movie production, expanded the concept of industrial film producer by bringing into the fold an assorted group of movie directors ranging from politicians and journalists like Nick Osme&#xF1;a and Hermenegildo Atienza to playwrights and theater personalities like <a href=\"/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a> and <a href=\"/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a>. The concept of a director as filmmaker&#x2014;that is, one whose involvement in the making of films is creative rather than business-oriented&#x2014;evolved with this group.

His studio<i> </i>gave the director more latitude, autonomy, and cinematic freedom. Premiere became the home of such outstanding directors as <a href=\"/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4450\">Cesar Gallardo</a>, <a href=\"/4/26/4580\">Consuelo P.

Mendoza&rsquo;s films are known to strive for verisimilitude, emphasizing everyday clothes and settings. As Mendoza derives stories from actual locations and uses people found in those locations as actors, he insists that the design of his movies be ultrarealistic. As he would put it, &ldquo;the less production design, the better.&rdquo; This trend toward neorealism is also seen in other indie movies designed by award-winning production designers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4375\">Mes de Guzman</a> in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1143\"><strong>Ang Daan Patungong Kalimugtong</strong></a></i></b> (<b><i>The Road to Kalimugtong</i></b>), 2005, and Leo Abaya in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1208\"><strong>Kubrador</strong></a> </i></b>(<b><i>The Bet Collector</i></b>), 2006.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Nick Cruz and Lena S.

		"text": "<p class=\"byliners\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Film promotion</b> is the process of creating an audience for a film through a comprehensive publicity program. The promotional campaign includes press conferences, press releases, and press previews; teasers, trailers, radio plugs, and TV commercials; posters, streamers, banners, still photos, cutouts, standees, and other theater lobby displays; magazine and newspaper advertising layouts, pictorials, handbills, feature articles, endorsements, and testimonials; billboards, marquees, and other outdoor displays; contests and giveaways; guest appearances on radio, television, benefit, and other shows; and premiere nights and opening-day theater tours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"byliners\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This elaborate multimedia plan is geared toward one purpose: to sell the movie using all resources available to the producer or promotions manager. From the late 1980s up to the present, a film to be successful at the box office must be alloted a budget of millions of pesos for promotional expenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The campaign to sell a movie begins right at the time the producer decides to produce a film or acquires the rights to a material that he would like to make into a film. It may be a true-to-life story, like <b><i>Bingbong:</i></b><i> <b>The Vincent</b></i> <b><i>Crisologo Story</i></b>, 1991; an event headlined in the newspapers, such as <b><i>Dope Addict</i></b>, 1961; a novel, like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1722\"><strong>A Child of Sorrow</strong></a></i></b>, 1930; a popular comic strip, like <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a></i></b>, 1950; a radio drama, like <b><i>Kasaysayan ni</i></b> <b><i>Dr.</i></b> <b><i>Ramon Selga </i></b>(The Story of Dr Ramon Selga), 1951; a television show, like <b><i>Lovingly Yours,</i></b> <b><i>Helen (The Movie)</i></b>, 1984; a remake, like <b><i>Jack n&rsquo; Jill of the Third Kind</i></b>, 1978; or sequel to a previous movie, like <b><i>Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll II</i></b>, 1990. The announcement is usually made through press releases or in a press conference, during which time the stars as well as the production staff are introduced to members of the print and broadcast media, who, in turn, will relay the information to their audiences of readers and viewers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the course of the production, announcements are made from time to time about the progress of the film shooting and other details that may be of interest to the moviegoing public. Updates are made on the latest happenings on the movie set, including trivial problems that crop up and how they are resolved, imagined amorous relations between leading actors, supposed fights between the principal protagonists and newsmakers, and how they affect the completion of the movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The producer enlists the services of publicists to promote the film. Some publicists resort to the gimmickry of public relations agents, manufacturing scandals to keep their stars in the limelight. The good publicist promotes the movie in more sober fashion, with the accent on balanced, credible accounts in the media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Trailers are very important in view of the scope and influence of the broadcast media. The commercial value of a movie trailer is so important that a major film producer like Lily Monteverde of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal Films</a> has been known to approve scripts on the basis of their having high points that could effectively be exploited in a trailer, such as crying and slapping scenes, kissing scenes, fight scenes, and shoot-outs with simulated explosions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television commercials are expensive but very effective because of their maximum exposure to a general audience of TV viewers. TV commercials are usually tied up with promotional appearances of the film&rsquo;s stars on noonday programs and other TV variety shows, such as showbiz-oriented news programs and talk shows. Guesting on these shows gives stars greater visibility that is supposed to heighten audience interest in the movie. Rumors of offscreen romance become a point of discussion while guesting to promote the film. The young love-team Kathryn Bernardo and Daniel Padilla, for example, were put &ldquo;on the hot seat&rdquo; when they guested on the showbiz-oriented talk show <b><i>The Buzz</i></b><i> </i>to promote their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4694\">Star Cinema</a> movie <b><i>Must Be&hellip; Love</i></b>, 2013, as the host <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4750\">Boy Abunda</a> brought up the persistent rumor of the two being officially a couple. Abunda, employed by the same group of companies that produced the film, wrote about the interview in the major daily <b><i>Philippine Star</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On some TV promo shows, contestants are required to act out a scene from the movie. Occasionally, the film&rsquo;s stars are requested to dance or to sing their movie&rsquo;s theme song or any song. TV guesting may occur before and during the run of the movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio is equally important and relatively cheaper than TV commercials. It is most effective when the aim is to reach specific audiences. Women doing housework are mostly daytime listeners. Rock music stations are youth-oriented. Radio helps promote a movie through its theme song, which usually carries the title of the film itself&mdash;for instance, &ldquo;Miss Na Miss Kita&rdquo; (I Miss You So Much) boosted ticket sales for <b><i>Miss na Miss Kita:</i></b> <b><i>Ang Utol</i></b> <b><i>Kong Hoodlum 2 </i></b>(I Miss You So Much: My Hoodlum Brother 2), 1992. The continuous playing/singing of the theme song from day to day generates interest and recall for a particular film. Radio plugs are also important, especially when last-minute announcements fail to meet print deadlines and the fastest way to communicate relevant information about the film is via the airwaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A film is a very perishable product, and news about a forthcoming motion picture should be kept fresh. It cannot afford to go stale and cease to interest its prospective audience. A publicity campaign, therefore, must concentrate on the time immediately prior to the opening of the movie. The newspaper is a prime medium for advertising when and where a movie will be shown, is currently showing, or about to close. Families that have no radio or television can rely on newspapers to give them this kind of information about the movies that they see occasionally. The first motion picture shown in the country was announced on 17 Dec 1896 in the newspaper <b><i>El Comercio</i></b><i> </i>before its opening in January the next year. The succeeding motion-picture exhibitions were promoted based on the novelty of the technology and its subjects as seen in the newspaper announcement about Lumi&egrave;re&rsquo;s Cinematographe films on 31 Aug 1897: &ldquo;The exhibition of <i>fen&oacute;men&oacute;s naturales</i> (natural phenomena) and <i>actos solemnes de actualidad</i> (formal acts of current events) was accompanied by an <i>orquesta</i> under the direction of Don Francisco de P. Barbat&rdquo; (del Mundo 2000, 89).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1910s, the pioneer film producers Albert Yearsley and Dr Edward Gross used print media extensively to promote their movies, <b><i>La Vida de Jose Rizal </i></b>(The Life of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>) and&nbsp;<b><i>El Fusilamiento de Dr.  <strong><strong>Jose Rizal</strong> </strong> </i></b>(The Execution of Dr Jose Rizal<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\">)</a>, both 1912. They capitalized on events of the Philippine revolution, but what generated considerable interest among moviegoers was the &ldquo;war of newspaper ads&rdquo; between them when they showed their films simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">Kundiman</a> </i>(traditional love song) queen <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2885\">Atang dela Rama</a> helped promote <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4571\">Jose Nepomuceno</a>&rsquo;s first silent movie, <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b> (Country Maiden), 1919, by singing its theme song on stage during film screenings. The movie rode on the popularity of the <i>sarsuwela</i> as an entertainment medium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b><i>Fate or Consequence</i></b>, 1926, actor-director-producer VicenteSalumbides featured &ldquo;society girls&rdquo; from respected families in Manila and students from the University of the Philippines, Philippine Law School, and Philippine Normal School, plus a beauty queen, &ldquo;Miss Cotabato&rdquo; (Sofia Lotta). Their appearance in his movie was quite unprecedented, generating interest in the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the rise of movie studios in the 1930s, each film-producing outfit had its own publicist/writer who had access to different publications. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\">Parlatone</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4574\">Luis F. Nolasco</a>, who was editor and columnist of <b><i>Literary</i></b> <b><i>Song Movie Magazine</i></b>, initiated the practice of movie stars appearing on magazine covers and color print ads to promote a motion picture, like that of <b><i>Diwata ng Karagatan</i></b>, 1936. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a>&rsquo; advertising and publicity manager, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5006\">T. D. Agcaoili</a>, edited the prewar <b><i>Graphic </i></b>and later the <b><i>Sunday Times Magazine</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which had an entertainment section for views and reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Colorful events like the annual Carnival Exposition of the 1930s were good venues for promotion and publicity. The participation of <b><i>Gamu-gamong Naging</i></b> <b><i>Lawin </i></b>(Moth That Became a Hawk), 1937, in the exposition parade and its winning the prize of &ldquo;Most Artistic Float&rdquo; two weeks before the film opened, gained unprecedented media mileage for the film and its stars, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\">Leopoldo Salcedo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4401\">Rosa del Rosario</a>. This practice has been carried on to the present day with the participation of movie floats in the annual parade of stars that precedes the opening of the Metro Manila Film Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When radio dramas and soap operas became the vogue in the 1950s, film producers utilized the medium, dramatizing their films in such radio shows as Luz Mat Castro&rsquo;s <b><i>The Big Broadcast</i></b>. The show became so popular that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a> eventually made a film version, <b><i>The Big Broadcast</i></b>, 1962. Another popular medium of that era was the short film used as added attraction to a motion picture. <b><i>Do&ntilde;a</i></b> <b><i><strong> <strong>Sisa</strong> </strong> ng&rsquo;s 78th Birthday Celebration</i></b>, a star-studded short feature, helped boost <b><i>Ikaw Kasi </i></b>(You Are to Blame), 1955, when it was shown together with the movie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Do&ntilde;a Sisang was also known to encourage publicity by controversy in promoting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>&rsquo;s love teams.

Stories with a high number of hits&mdash;that is, the instance of opening the work&mdash;have been adapted into films and promoted as such, like <b><i>Diary ng Panget</i></b> (Diary of the Ugly), 2014, and <b><i>She&rsquo;s Dating the Gangster</i></b>, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most of these efforts are geared to getting the audience into the theaters on opening day. After the first few days of showing, what becomes significant is word-of-mouth or audience reaction to the movie. At this point, advertising can air on TV interviews or comments of critics and of ordinary folk who have seen the film. When a movie is being shown, advertising serves to remind people that the film is still around, telling them where to go if they have not seen it yet or if they want to see it again.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Lena S.

Guesting on these shows gives stars greater visibility that is supposed to heighten audience interest in the movie. Rumors of offscreen romance become a point of discussion while guesting to promote the film.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Scriptwriting</b> is the process by which the film characters and plots are fleshed out in specific scenes and dialogues. When written down, the <b>script</b> represents the first and most basic element in filmmaking. It constitutes the raw material from which is derived the sequence of images that, when strung together in a cohesive whole, make up a film. The person responsible for this is known as the <b>scriptwriter</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scripts for film may come from sources that the filmmaker believes can be translated into the film medium. These sources may include literature, theater, music, dance, the visual arts, print and broadcast media, as well as actual personalities, events, and even locations, past or present. The scriptwriter and director have to decide whether such material can be the vehicle for their ideas and whether it lends itself to cinematic visualization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scriptwriting involves two elements: narrative flow and dialogue. In general, one minute of screentime requires one page of script, and scripts may consist of anywhere from 60 to several hundred pages. Scripts may likewise employ a wealth of details, ranging from suggestions for visual style to descriptions of the setting. This is crucial to the work not only of directors but also of actors, cinematographers, and editors. Unlike TV, the film experience is a community activity that requires total focus on what is projected on-screen while submerged in total darkness to be able to let go of the real and actual world for 100 or so minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There are two kinds of <b>screenplays</b> based on how and why they are created. The <b>commissioned screenplay</b> is when a studio or producer hires a scriptwriter to create a specific work based on the needs of the company or individual financing the project or to provide a vehicle for actors and actresses prized not only for their talent but also for their bankability. In other words, commissioned screenplays are tailor-made to comply with certain needs enumerated by the studio heads. The <b>speculative screenplay</b> is created by the writer with no specific production plans. This can be an entry in a screenwriting competition or simply a work to fulfill the desire to give form and substance to a story in the mind of the artist. A speculative screenplay can be submitted to directors and producers for consideration. The writer may also interest a filmmaker or an actor to be part of the project&mdash;thus having their names attached when the script is pitched to a producer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The screenplay provides the map that traces the journey of a character or characters to achieve or fail in their goals, thus illustrating the value of its theme. The script provides the structure of events that lead characters into their various tests&mdash;where both their failure and success form the backbone of understanding their sense of purpose, ambition, or even validation. The challenge to the <b>director</b> is to bring to life the words in the script&mdash;while at the same time making this his own vision. The collaboration between director and scriptwriter is considered the most essential in the filmmaking process. In the ultimate analysis, the successful collaboration is determined by how effectively the director interprets on film the scriptwriter&rsquo;s ideas and concepts, in collaboration with the cinematographer, production designer, editor, and other film artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the early days of Philippine cinema, <b>producers</b> have exercised control over the kind of material that they make into films. Most of the stories that became popular during the pre-World War II era were translations and adaptations of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a>, and popular and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>. There was, however, no discernible surefire formula for box-office success in the choice of material. Examples of the prewar era&rsquo;s biggest box-office hits are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1163\"><b><i><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</i></b></a><i> </i>(Florante and Laura), 1939, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1184\"><b><i>Ibong  <strong>Adarna</strong> </i></b></a><i> </i>(Adarna Bird), 1941, which were both adaptations of well-known metrical romances that were to have several remakes. <b><i><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Wheel of Fortune), 1950, and <b><i><strong>Mga Kuwento ni  <strong>Lola</strong> Basyang</strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Stories of Grandma Basyang), 1958, were popular radio serials that later became big box-office hits. On the other hand, such box-office sensations as <b><i>Se&ntilde;orita</i></b><i> </i>(Young Mistress), 1940, and <b><i>Roberta</i></b>,<i> </i>1951, relied mainly on their stars&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4247\">Tessie Agana</a>, respectively&mdash;and the tremendous appeal of their material. After World War II, stories based on the war appeared, like <b><i>Dugo ng Bayan</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>I Remember Bataan</i></b>), 1946, and <b><i><strong>Fort Santiago</strong> </i></b>,<i> </i>1946.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, when the studios of the Big Four flourished, the producers dominated the choice of material for their productions. Each of the major studios hired a regular stable of writers whose chief function was to translate the producer&rsquo;s own storylines into scripts. At <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, for instance, Jose R. Perez, the chief executive, would himself write the draft of a script, which he then passed on to a writer to work on and complete. Most of Perez&rsquo;s scenarios were done under the pseudonym Jose Leonardo. The same was true at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4508\">Lebran</a>, where the studio moguls wielded considerable power in shaping the material, from the moment it was conceived up to the time the film was completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s and 1960s, however, there were writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4261\">Cesar Amigo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4293\">Rolf Bayer</a>, Pierre Salas, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a> who wrote scripts at a time when these were not yet fashionable or considered essential by producers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The situation hardly changed in the studio setup of the 1970s. In the big studios of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4624\">Regal</a>, Seiko, or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4735\">Viva</a>, the idea for a film most often came from the producer. It was the producer who ultimately decided to film the scripts that had been approved for filming or still need to be written. The practice was simply to hire a scriptwriter upon the recommendation of the producer or director who, in turn, may either closely follow or revise the script, to please the producer or appease a &ldquo;bankable&rdquo; star.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A welcome development took place in the 1970s when a group of scriptwriters, playwrights, and poets formed the Philippine Scriptwriters Inc, upon the initiative of then censors&rsquo; chief Guillermo de Vega. The group was organized mainly to help enhance the overall quality of films made locally and at the same time promote the welfare and well-being of writers for the motion picture industry. However, their efforts were nipped in the bud with the death of de Vega.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scriptwriting received an accidental boost from new guidelines set by the censors in 1975. The censors&rsquo; board required that scripts be submitted for scrutiny and approval before actual production. The ultimate objective was to ban film material that may contain political statements against the martial law regime of Pres Ferdinand Marcos. Indirectly, the requirement resulted in the commissioning of full-blown scripts. Improvement of the quality of scripts was the aim of the scriptwriting contest sponsored by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) in the early 1980s. By providing sufficient incentives to writers and ensuring the filming of award-winning scenarios, the ECP was able to draw a number of established and serious writers to join the competition. Thus were created the scripts of such noteworthy ECP films as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1256\"><b><i>Oro, Plata, Mata</i></b></a><i> </i>(<b><i>Gold, Silver, Death</i></b>), 1982;<b> <i>Soltero</i></b><i> </i>(Bachelor), 1983; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><strong>Himala</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Miracle</i></b>), 1982; and <b><i>Misteryo sa Tuwa</i></b><i> </i>(Joyful Mystery), 1984, With the entry of writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4510\">Ricardo Lee</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3127\">Bienvenido Noriega Jr</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4398\">Clodualdo del Mundo Jr</a>, more literary artists began to offer their services as scriptwriters. To this list can be added such names as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4431\">Marina Feleo-Gonzales</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5209\">Jose Y. Dalisay Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4270\">Jorge Arago</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4319\">Jose Carreon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4495\">Amado Lacuesta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\">Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</a>, the critics&rsquo; organization founded in 1976, gave scriptwriters much-deserved recognition by extolling their work after that of the directors&rsquo; during its awards rites. The message was loud and clear: without writers, there would be no directors and consequently no films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also at about this time, the craft of scriptwriting was finally beginning to be studied, taught, and discussed in workshops and seminars and through film courses in schools like the University of the Philippines (UP), the Ateneo de Manila University, and the De La Salle University. Del Mundo&rsquo;s award-winning script of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5634\">Edgardo Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1796\"><strong><i>Sa mga Kuko ng Liwanag</i></strong></a><i> </i>started as a thesis for his scriptwriting class at the Ateneo under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4972\">Nestor Torre</a>. Regular workshops on scriptwriting were offered by Mowelfund and the UP Film Center, now the UP Film Institute. Similarly, leading film writers, like Ricky<i> </i>Lee, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4500\">Armando Lao</a>, conducted their own workshops at one time or the other for aspiring writers and students. Del Mundo published <b><i>Writing for Film</i></b> in 1981. In 1998, Lee published his <b><i>Trip to Quiapo</i></b>, a manual for scriptwriting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scriptwriters continued to work under difficult conditions imposed by the studio. The most typical problem they faced concerns the endless revisions made on their material either by the producer or<i> </i>the director (unless the latter happens to be the scriptwriter himself). Thus, it was common for writers to<i> </i>complain that their work had been mangled and even completely altered by these people. Others complained that their work was no longer theirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the few directors who gave scriptwriters their rightful importance are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4389\">Mike de Leon</a>. These directors tried to follow the shooting script religiously; when revisions had to be made, they made it a point to consult their scriptwriters. Brocka&rsquo;s best films were written by award-winning literary figures like Lee, Dalisay, and Lacaba. Bernal&rsquo;s scripts were mostly written by Arago, while de Leon&rsquo;s were mostly done by del Mundo. The published scripts by Lee (<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1239\"><strong>Moral</strong></a></i></b><i>/<b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1130\"><strong>Brutal</strong></a> </b></i>and <b><i>Himala</i></b>), Lualhati Bautista (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1114\"><b><i>Bata, Bata... Paano Ka Ginawa?</i></b></a>),<i> </i>and del Mundo <i>(<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\"><b>Maynila </b></a></i><b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1230\">&hellip;</a> <i>&rsquo;Merika at Alyas Raha Matanda</i></b>)<i> </i>serve as models of scriptwriting and guides for scriptwriters and students who want to understand more fully the language of film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the rise of the New Wave Independent Film in 2005, the screenplay was again given importance by festivals and competitions, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\">Cinema One Originals</a>, who chose to give grants to certain directors based on the scenarios they submitted. Because most of the indie directors are auteurs, they wrote their own scripts or had a part in its writing. These include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4498\">Jun Robles Lana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4539\">Chris Martinez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4256\">Adolfo Alix Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4503\">Yam Laranas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4537\">Raya Martin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Auraeus Solito</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4700\">Jerrold Tarog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4708\">John Torres</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4670\">Sherad Anthony Sanchez</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5792\">Alvin Yapan</a>. Among the scriptwriters who did the screenplays for award-winning indie films are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4737\">Michiko Yamamoto</a> and Armando Lao.

In general, one minute of screentime requires one page of script, and scripts may consist of anywhere from 60 to several hundred pages. Scripts may likewise employ a wealth of details, ranging from suggestions for visual style to descriptions of the setting. This is crucial to the work not only of directors but also of actors, cinematographers, and editors. Unlike TV, the film experience is a community activity that requires total focus on what is projected on-screen while submerged in total darkness to be able to let go of the real and actual world for 100 or so minutes."

The <b>commissioned screenplay</b> is when a studio or producer hires a scriptwriter to create a specific work based on the needs of the company or individual financing the project or to provide a vehicle for actors and actresses prized not only for their talent but also for their bankability. In other words, commissioned screenplays are tailor-made to comply with certain needs enumerated by the studio heads. The <b>speculative screenplay</b> is created by the writer with no specific production plans. This can be an entry in a screenwriting competition or simply a work to fulfill the desire to give form and substance to a story in the mind of the artist. A speculative screenplay can be submitted to directors and producers for consideration. The writer may also interest a filmmaker or an actor to be part of the project&#x2014;thus having their names attached when the script is pitched to a producer."

The challenge to the <b>director</b> is to bring to life the words in the script&#x2014;while at the same time making this his own vision. The collaboration between director and scriptwriter is considered the most essential in the filmmaking process.

There was, however, no discernible surefire formula for box-office success in the choice of material.

At <a href=\"/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita</a>, for instance, Jose R. Perez, the chief executive, would himself write the draft of a script, which he then passed on to a writer to work on and complete.

The censors&#x2019; board required that scripts be submitted for scrutiny and approval before actual production.

Indirectly, the requirement resulted in the commissioning of full-blown scripts. Improvement of the quality of scripts was the aim of the scriptwriting contest sponsored by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) in the early 1980s. By providing sufficient incentives to writers and ensuring the filming of award-winning scenarios, the ECP was able to draw a number of established and serious writers to join the competition.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">In movie production, <b>sound recording</b> is the application of dialogue, music, narration, sound effects, and other aural elements to the film. Before the emergence of digital technology, there were two ways of recording sound. One was the <b>optical method</b>, which refers to recording sound on sound film stock. The other was the <b>magnetic method</b>, in which sound is recorded on 35 mm magnetic tape and the final mix (dialogue, music, narration, effects) is transferred to film negative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the optical method, the key factor in shooting sound and film together is <b>synchronization</b>. If the picture negative and the sound film do not move at the same speed in relation to each other, lip movements and dialogue will not be coordinated and the film will be &ldquo;out of sync.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the most important activities in the second method is <b>post-sync dialogue dubbing</b>. Here, the sound track recorded at the time of photography is used only as a guide and is referred to as a <b>cue track</b>. The scenes are projected silently on a big screen and the actor watches lip movements carefully while listening through headsets to the audio track. The film and audio track are played over repeatedly until the dubber can repeat the lines into a microphone at the speed and timing of the original recording, in effect matching the original track. The new recorded dialogue, now free of extraneous sounds or noise and corrected during the dubbing, becomes the dialogue track of the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carefully controlled ambient sounds or other background sounds go into the special effects track. Music goes into the music track. The <b>sound engineer</b> or designer must consider the relationships among these different tracks when, together with the film director, he or she judges the relative value of sounds to be heard in each scene. When all sound tracks have been edited and cleaned, the final creative task&mdash;the <b>sound mixing</b>&mdash;begins. The mix is the artistic and skillful blending of all sound tracks into a single track, a process that is accomplished with the use of 35 mm magnetic tape recording. This is done in a special sound recording studio equipped with interlock machines to run many separate sound tracks synchronously with the projected picture. The sound engineer sits at a large console with controls and adjusts the volume and quality of each track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the past, the most common accusation mistakenly directed against the sound engineer is that of poor synchronization of sound and visuals. This responsibility is actually shared by the film editor, the negative matcher, and the laboratory technician doing the optical transfers. A more serious offense was the industry&rsquo;s dependence on dubbed sound, which resulted in a lack of realism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When sound was first used in Philippine movies in 1932, studios were equipped with sound booths and re-recording facilities, which merely refined what had already been recorded during photography. Seldom, if at all, was dialogue reproduced in the picture&rsquo;s entirety. Songs were prerecorded in the studio by singers whose voices matched the actors&rsquo; to the accompaniment of a group of musicians. The finished compositions were played back during the shooting so that the actors could &ldquo;lip-sync&rdquo; the songs as they performed before the camera. Since this was done without sound, the shooting would proceed at a faster pace, and after photography the playback tape was dubbed into the sound track of the film.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first Filipino sound recording engineer in Philippine cinema was Isabela-born William Smith, who worked on <b><i>Ang Aswang</i></b> (The Aswang), 1932, the first Filipino talking picture. He set up the studio sound systems of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4589\">Parlatone Hispano-Filipino</a> in 1935 and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4668\">Sampaguita Pictures </a>in 1937. Another Filipino sound pioneer, Charles Gray from Tacloban, Leyte, trained in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4437\">Filippine Films</a> under American sound engineer Louise R. Morse. Gray set up the sound studio of X&rsquo;Otic Films in 1941 and later organized Movietec for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4508\">Lebran Studio</a> after the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the days of the studio system, each major studio had its own sound engineer who supervised the work of recordists and technicians hired as regular employees. They were Joseph Straight at Sampaguita, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4471\">July P. Hidalgo</a> at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4520\">LVN</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4395\">Demetrio de Santos</a> at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4606\">Premiere</a>, and Angelo Larraga at Lebran.

This was the transition from field-recorded sound to magnetic film recording. The entire film production was shot with guide sound and dubbed in completely with entire tracks of dialogue, music, narration, and effects. This innovation allowed the director greater creative freedom as he worked side by side with the sound engineer and the film editor in the postproduction phase of the film. The effect of sounds, like dogs barking offscreen or a plane&rsquo;s wheels touching down when landing, heightened the sense of urgency or realism and added mood or atmosphere to the film. The overdependence on dubbing resulted in a kind of artificiality in some films.

The film and audio track are played over repeatedly until the dubber can repeat the lines into a microphone at the speed and timing of the original recording, in effect matching the original track.

When all sound tracks have been edited and cleaned, the final creative task&#x2014;the <b>sound mixing</b>&#x2014;begins. The mix is the artistic and skillful blending of all sound tracks into a single track, a process that is accomplished with the use of 35 mm magnetic tape recording. This is done in a special sound recording studio equipped with interlock machines to run many separate sound tracks synchronously with the projected picture. The sound engineer sits at a large console with controls and adjusts the volume and quality of each track."

Songs were prerecorded in the studio by singers whose voices matched the actors&#x2019; to the accompaniment of a group of musicians. The finished compositions were played back during the shooting so that the actors could &#x201C;lip-sync&#x201D; the songs as they performed before the camera.

				"value": "A major change in sound technology in Philippine cinema occurred in the late 1960s when all sound recording studios were equipped with interlock machines and projectors. This was the transition from field-recorded sound to magnetic film recording. The entire film production was shot with guide sound and dubbed in completely with entire tracks of dialogue, music, narration, and effects. This innovation allowed the director greater creative freedom as he worked side by side with the sound engineer and the film editor in the postproduction phase of the film. The effect of sounds, like dogs barking offscreen or a plane&#x2019;s wheels touching down when landing, heightened the sense of urgency or realism and added mood or atmosphere to the film. The overdependence on dubbing resulted in a kind of artificiality in some films. In this period, some of the movie studios specializing in sound recording and re-recording activities, like Magnatech Omni and PM Studio at Sampaguita, were set up to provide postproduction services to movie producers."

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Film taxation</b> is the imposition of levies on film production, importation, and exhibition. In the Philippines, film taxes are levied on film producers, importers, distributors, exhibitors, and moviegoers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As early as the 1950s, producers were beginning to feel the burden of onerous taxation. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4663\">Vicente Salumbides</a>&rsquo;s book <b><i>Motion Pictures in the Philippines</i></b>, 1952, carries an illustration of a chicken (representing the local film industry) that is weighed down by stones and unable to fly to greater heights because of government taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An early study conducted by Carlos J. Valdes and Company for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4597\">Philippine Motion Picture Producers Association</a> and the Film Fund based on the 1977 Annual Report of the International Federation of Film Producers revealed that Filipino producers paid the highest rate of film taxes to the government (a total of 42 percent, including the amusement tax of approximately 30 percent), compared to what film producers paid in 14 other countries. In Finland, amusement taxes were collected only from pornographic and violent films in an amount corresponding to 25 percent. It is also interesting to note that from 1955 to 1977, the amount of taxes paid by movie industries in other countries to their governments declined, while the exact opposite happened in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When film celluloid was the format of filmmaking in the industry, payment of taxes for film production began with the importation of the raw material, which was not available locally. The popular brands of stock used extensively by local producers were Eastman Kodak from the United States, Agfa from Germany, and Fuji Film from Japan. The amount of specific tax for raw film varied with film size (35 mm or 16 mm) and length (per linear meter). Specific taxes were also paid on imported film equipment, accessories, and materials used for movie production. The compensating tax alone on landed cost of the merchandise sometimes reached up to 100 percent or more compared to its actual cost at the time of purchase abroad. In addition, the ad valorem or sales tax was levied on these materials before they were released by Customs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fixed business taxes were imposed on film production companies in varying degrees depending on whether they were single proprietorships, partnerships, or corporations. Permits to operate as a business were secured from the mayor&rsquo;s office of the city or municipality concerned, and payments of various licenses, fees, and municipal taxes were required. When the film was ready to be shown, a censors&rsquo; permit was obtained from the censor&rsquo;s board prior to the film exhibition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Within 10 days after the end of each month following the exhibition of a movie production, the exhibitor was expected to pay over such tax payments to the proper city or municipal treasurer. The amusement tax at the time, which was included in the cost of the movie ticket, amounted to 30 percent of the admission price. In addition to the amusement tax, a cultural tax of 25 centavos per ticket and a flood tax of another 25 centavos per ticket were also included in the ticket price paid by the moviegoer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As an illustration, for every 15-peso ticket paid by the moviegoer, the government approximately received 42 percent, while the exhibitor and producer received 29 percent each. Producers&rsquo; and exhibitors&rsquo; incomes were further reduced when they were charged the monthly percentage tax of two percent on gross revenue. For income remitted abroad, a producer&rsquo;s tax of 25 percent was charged. The producer was also liable to a billings tax of three percent of net film income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To get an appreciation of film taxation in 2015, the summary of taxes that film investors, producers, and contractors need to know follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nothing much has changed to lighten the heavy taxation on the film industry. The film industry is still among the most heavily taxed in Asia, if not the world. Among such taxes is the amusement tax (10 percent of the gross ticket price). Add to this the 12 percent value added tax imposed on all purchases incurred during the production process. In other countries, there is no amusement tax, only a minimal municipal tax. In Japan, Brunei, and Australia, there is no amusement tax at all. Therefore, in the Philippines, the burden is imposed on the moviegoing public through high-priced admission ticket, talents who are subjected to withholding taxes, and producers who cover the cost of production. Much of the revenue on the film industry goes to the national and local governments, but not enough is ploughed back to improve the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Compared to 188 other countries, the Philippines ranks 126th in the ease of paying taxes with a total tax rate (percentage of profit) of 42.9 percent.

In Finland, amusement taxes were collected only from pornographic and violent films in an amount corresponding to 25 percent. It is also interesting to note that from 1955 to 1977, the amount of taxes paid by movie industries in other countries to their governments declined, while the exact opposite happened in the Philippines."

The amount of specific tax for raw film varied with film size (35 mm or 16 mm) and length (per linear meter). Specific taxes were also paid on imported film equipment, accessories, and materials used for movie production. The compensating tax alone on landed cost of the merchandise sometimes reached up to 100 percent or more compared to its actual cost at the time of purchase abroad. In addition, the ad valorem or sales tax was levied on these materials before they were released by Customs."

In other countries, there is no amusement tax, only a minimal municipal tax. In Japan, Brunei, and Australia, there is no amusement tax at all. Therefore, in the Philippines, the burden is imposed on the moviegoing public through high-priced admission ticket, talents who are subjected to withholding taxes, and producers who cover the cost of production. Much of the revenue on the film industry goes to the national and local governments, but not enough is ploughed back to improve the industry."

The subject of film training is generally regarded in the Philippines as something practical; film studies, on the other hand, involves the theoretical, although it may include production courses. It is said that one has to go to the film industry for the former and to academe to learn the latter. Many Filipino filmmakers are largely self-taught. No diploma is required of applicants in the film industry except, perhaps, a high-school certificate and a desire to learn and practice an aspect of moviemaking, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1080\">directing</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1082\">editing</a>, or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/22/1077\">cinematography</a>. Most movie production studios provide a kind of informal training in the work required of a talent. In mainstream cinema, the important considerations are the person&rsquo;s track record, experience, and exposure to the craft. Outstanding Filipino directors learned filmmaking as the prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of their predecessors: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4295\">Ishmael Bernal</a> from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4648\">Eddie Romero</a> from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> from Eddie Romero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although a formal <b>film course</b> does not guarantee automatic admission into the industry, film courses have been quite popular in colleges and universities since the late 1960s. The movement called the New Wave or Nouvelle Vague was sweeping across France at this time. It would in time reach other countries where it would provide the impetus to make film not only as a commercial but also as an artistic undertaking. When the University of the Philippines Film Center (UPFC) was established in 1976, it became a haven for young filmmakers who wished to learn the mechanics of film through ways other than those already available in mainstream cinema. In the late 1970s, UPFC workshops fostered the use of film for individual expression. The &ldquo;Cinema-as-Art Workshop&rdquo; was conducted in Diliman, Quezon City. &ldquo;Cinema Direct on Ethnic Film&rdquo; went on location to the various regions of the country; in 1985 the workshop was conducted in UP Baguio by the Paris Varan director and anthropologist Alain Martenot. At another time it was held in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna. The &ldquo;Experimental Film Workshops&rdquo; was conducted by the Germans Ingo Petzke and Christoph Janetzko. After the UP Film Center was merged with the Film and Audio-Visual Communication Department to form the UP Film Institute (UPFI) in 2003, workshops on major aspects of filmmaking were offered every year on a regular basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of institutions from both government and the private sector have served to bridge the gap between film studies in academe and film training in mainstream cinema through the holding of lectures, workshops, film festivals, and film competitions. The Annual Short Film Festival sponsored by the Experimental Cinema of the Philippines (ECP) boosted independent filmmaking. Though short-lived, the ECP (1982-85) served its purpose of developing new and gifted filmmakers in the Philippines. The ECP Short Film Festival competitions stimulated great interest in short filmmaking, mainly by offering cash prizes and trophies to winners in four categories: experimental, short feature, documentary, and animation.
