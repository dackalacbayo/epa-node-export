Houses and monuments from Batanes to Tawi-Tawi not only represent different cultures and periods in Philippine history, they also constitute the Filipino&rsquo;s creative response to the problems posed by the geography and climate of the archipelago. The 7,641 islands of the Philippines appear to be a mountain range that is half submerged. More than half of the land is mountainous and hilly. With their headwaters in the mountains, rivers flow down to the plains and out to the sea. For its relatively small area of 301,780 sq km, the country has an extensive coastline of 36,289 km. On this fragmented territory and rugged terrain, on mountain, plain, riverbank, and seacoast, the people have made their home. With its southernmost islands about four degrees from the equator, and its northern and central islands in the path of typhoons, the Philippines is subject to the worst of tropical heat, humidity, and rain. A long dry season can bring drought, rains can cause floods, and high winds can ruin houses. Several times a year, the land is rocked by earthquakes. Yet, as the climate dictates the need for shelter, the land provides the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">materials</a> for it: wood from the forests, bamboo from groves, leaves from the fields, stone from rivers and quarries, and clay from the earth itself. Setting, climate, and available materials are among the factors that give shelter its form and character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"indigenousTradition\" name=\"indigenousTradition\"></a>The Indigenous Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest shelters of human beings were probably not built by them. They simply found these shelters or found themselves in them. It was nature that fashioned hollows on cliffs and mountainsides that offered protection from heat, rain, and wind. In Binangonan, Rizal evidence of ancient cave dwellers exists in carved figures on cave walls known as the Angono-Binangonan&nbsp;Petroglyphs, the earliest known Philippine mural. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/386\">Tabon Cave</a> in Palawan yielded the earliest-known remains of human beings in the Philippines dated to about 37,000 years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time, the food gatherers, the fishers, or the hunters, who moved from one place to another in their search for food and game, realized they needed a portable form of shelter. Thus, they fashioned the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\">lean-to</a> from a frame made of tree branches and twigs, using leaves and fronds for sidings. A screen resting on the ground and held up at an angle by one or several poles, the lean-to is both roof and wall, protecting dwellers from rain and the heat of the sun. The floor can be the ground itself or a bed of leaves or a platform slightly above the ground. The lean-to is light enough to be carried to another site. However, the dweller can simply abandon it and build another. A pair of lean-tos can be joined together to form a tent-like shelter or a double-slope roof, which, in effect, is the beginning of a house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Kaingin&nbsp;</em>or swidden farming led to a relatively settled life. After making a clearing in the forest, the swidden farmer could cultivate it for two years; let it lie fallow, then return to it a few years later. Although dwellings became larger and were better built, they were neither permanent nor durable because sometimes the swidden farmer had to move on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the development of wet rice culture, farmers became rooted to the land. Although traces of the kaingin lifestyle persisted in the makeshift character of various dwellings, houses were built to last. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a> of Mindoro, who are swidden farmers, have two types of houses&mdash;the single-family dwelling and the communal house. Although the communal house is occupied by several families, its interior is not divided by partitions. The area for each family is defined by a mat on the floor. When a Mangyan house is built on a slope, the entrance faces the rise. The steep roof is of cogon grass, the sidings, of tree bark, and the floor, of logs and saplings. The house appears to have no windows. However, it has a narrow strip of opening between roof and wall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For added protection from floods, wild animals, and enemies, some houses were built on trees, anywhere from 2 to 20 m above the ground. Such houses have been found among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a> in northern Luzon, and among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> in Mindanao. One type of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/248\">tree house</a> nestles on the branches of a tree. Another type rests partly on a tall tree stump and partly on a cluster of tall stilts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of the Cordilleras in northern Luzon are swidden farmers. But some, particularly the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, are known for their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/241\">rice terraces</a>. With massive, towering walls and a skillfully devised irrigation system, the rice terraces are a wonder of primitive engineering. The terrace builders were able to construct sturdy dwellings remarkable for both simplicity and ingenuity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one-room Ifugao house, known as <strong>fale</strong>, is a little marvel of construction. Outside, the Ifugao house seems to be nothing more than a pyramid resting on four posts. The interior space&mdash; enclosed by slanting walls, sloping roof, and ceiling formed by the loft&mdash;appears nearly spherical. The dark, windowless chamber suggests a womb. Four wooden posts rest on a pavement and support two wooden girders that, in turn, support three wooden transverse joists. On the posts are wooden discs that prevent rats from entering the house. The ladder is drawn up at night or is hung across the front when the occupants are away. The floor joists, floor sills, vertical studs, and horizontal beams at about head level form a cage that rests on the posts and girders. Floorboards are fitted between the joists. Wooden sidings slant outward and rise to waist height to form the lower half of the wall. The upper half of the wall is formed by the inner side of the roof. Boards flanking the front and rear doors rise to the beams. The rafters of the roof rest on the beams and extend downward close to floor level. The roof frame is sheathed with reed like <strong>runo</strong> (cane grass) then covered with thatch. At an inner corner of the house is the fireplace. At the level of the beam is a storage loft with a floor of runo stalks. The wooden parts of this house are joined by rabbeting and by mortise and tenon. Other parts are fastened by lashing. Since nails are not used, the house can easily be dismantled, carried to a new site, and reassembled. The solitary room is the sleeping room, kitchen, dining room, storeroom, and shrine for rituals. Only the husband and wife and children in infancy live in this house. Upon reaching the age of reason, sons and daughters sleep in separate communal dormitories. Next to this house stands its twin, a granary with the same design as the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Mayoyao, the Ifugao house is distinguished by its classic simplicity. Its roof is high and steep. Low stone walls and a pavement form the setting of this house. With the smooth, fine-grained hardwood posts, rat guards are not necessary. The elevated living space in the fale becomes a granary in the Bontok house, as the living quarters move down to ground level. A low wall encloses the ground floor. The four-post, two-girder, and three-joist structure of the Ifugao is also used in the Bontok house. The Sagada house resembles the Bontok house but is fully covered. It is a wooden box with a steep thatch roof as a lid. With the granary within, the Sagada house is a &ldquo;house within a house.&rdquo; The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a> house is still another variation of the Ifugao prototype. The roof is higher and wider, thereby providing a spacious loft above the living space. On the ground level wooden planks are laid to provide additional livable space. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a> house has a larger room, a flaring roof, and a small porch. Some of the Kalinga live in octagonal houses. The central portion of the octagonal house rests on a four-post, two-girder, and three-joist structure. Beyond this frame eight posts are added to form the eight sides of the house. Wooden laths resting on joists support the runo floor, which can be rolled up like a mat and taken to the river for washing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boat forms appear to have inspired the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a> house. The bamboo roof suggests an inverted boat, and wooden floor joists have the profile of a boat. The Isneg house has two sets of posts: the inner set supporting the floor and the outer set supporting the roof. As in the Kalinga house, the floor can be rolled up. The walls are vertical boards set into grooves that are cut into beams at floor and roof-eaves level. A window is created by simply taking out a few boards. All the wallboards can be removed to make the house a roofed platform for village celebrations. The Isneg house is the largest among the Cordillera houses, since the entire family, and even married offspring&rsquo;s spouses, could live in it. It is not known when and how Cordillera houses developed into their present forms. However, these house forms developed in isolation and were untouched by Western influence, for the Spanish colonizers did not succeed in bringing the region and its people under their rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On hilltops and rolling land, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> of southern Cotabato in Mindanao build large one-room houses on stilts. The roof is of dried grass, the walls of woven bamboo, and the posts of whole bamboo and, occasionally, tree stumps. The central portion of the floor is slightly lower than the areas around it. The side sections are for working or resting. At one end are the entrance and the fireplace, and at the other is the place of honor for the head of the house. The interior of the Tboli house is one example of a characteristic feature of Philippine houses&mdash;space surrounded by space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Islam was established in Sulu in the 14th century and in Mindanao in the 15th century. The combination of a strong, organized religion and a high degree of political organization enabled the Muslim people of Mindanao to resist Spain&rsquo;s attempts to bring them under her dominion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> of Sulu, one of the Muslim peoples of the Philippines, are known as seafarers, but they build their houses on land, away from the shore. A site is considered lucky if it is flat and dry or if it gently slopes westward&mdash;towards Mecca. The traditional Tausug house rests on nine posts, each signifying a part of the body&mdash;the neck, navel, groin, left and right sides of the shoulders, ribs, and hips. Basically a one-room house, the Tausug dwelling includes a porch and a separate kitchen. A distinguishing feature of the house is an elaborately carved wooden finial, called <strong>tajuk pasung</strong>, placed at one or both ends of the roof ridge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> (Badjao) are people of the sea. The sea is their source of livelihood, the link to other people, and the place for celebration. It is also home. The Sama build their houses on stilts over the water, along the shore or farther out, grouped together in villages and connected by bridges and catwalks. Unlike the Sama house, the Sama Dilaut land house stands alone on an expanse of water and is reached only by boat. It is not joined by bridges or catwalks to the shore or to other houses. It is an island made by humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Muslim Filipinos, there arose two institutions which did not develop among the other ethnic peoples, namely, a specific place for worship and the lordly residence of the ruler. The earliest mosque in the Philippines is said to have been built in 1380 in Simunul Island, Tawi-Tawi. At present, mosques in the Philippines follow the traditional Middle East design which includes an onion-shaped dome and minarets. However, some mosques are closer to indigenous architecture, with a multi-tiered roof resembling that of a pagoda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Muslim chief resides in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\"><strong>torogan</strong></a>, a huge, stately, towering house, with a single large room. Although torogan simply means a place for sleeping, the house is more than a residence. It is also used for official meetings, social gatherings, and religious rituals. Only the chief, the sultan, or datu is entitled to own and live in a torogan. The soaring, flaring roof, like a ceremonial umbrella, is a proclamation of exalted status. The massive posts serve as solid supports and signify established power. To protect the house from earthquakes, the oversized posts rest on stones. With this device, the house sways with the tremor, playfully surviving it. Posts may be plain and bulky or may be carved to look like clay pots or outsized chess pieces. The most arresting feature of the torogan is the set of protruding beam-ends, called <strong>panolong</strong>. Flaring out from the facade, intricately carved, and stunningly colored, the panolong resembles a boat&rsquo;s prows and makes the splendid torogan appear to float like a royal barge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all the variety of design and construction, Cordillera, Mindanao, and Sulu houses are basically one-room dwellings covered by steep roofs and raised on stilts. They are all related to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut), which in its simplicity is regarded as a prototype. Largely of bamboo and thatch, and with parts woven, fitted or tied together, the bahay kubo might be described as less of a building and more of a basket. While posts, beams, and joists are assembled, the roof is put together separately and later fitted on top like the lid of a basket. The bamboo floor, with its slats set slightly apart, is like the bottom of a basket and makes for incomparable ventilation. With air coming in through windows and floor and the crevices in thatch and bamboo walls, the bahay kubo is a house that breathes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Houses take an entirely different form in the Batanes, the northernmost islands of the archipelago. With the frequency of high winds and strong rain, the Batanes house is built to hug the ground. Thick stone walls and a thick grass roof withstand the severest storm. The roof is supported by posts encased in the stone walls. Stone and mortar construction was introduced in the Batanes islands during the Spanish regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>The Hispanic Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With cross and sword, Spain extended her empire to the Philippines in the 16th century. The Spanish colonizers settled in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a> in 1565. Since Miguel Lopez de Legazpi had been instructed to establish more settlements and since sources of food in Cebu were inadequate, the Spaniards moved northward to Luzon, which was more extensive in area and more fertile. In 1571 the Spaniards conquered <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Manila</a>. Strategically located on the shore of a bay and at the mouth of a river, Manila was eminently suitable for defense, administration, and trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spaniards occupied the fort that had been abandoned by Raja Sulayman, ruler of Manila. In time, the wooden palisades gave way to fortifications of stone and a Spanish city took shape, following the prescriptions issued by King Philip II in 1573. The city was provided with a principal plaza and secondary plazas. Streets were laid out in a gridiron pattern. This pattern, known in Spanish as&nbsp;<em>quadricula</em>, was an innovation in urban design, proposed by Renaissance architects and theoreticians, as the ideal shape of the city. It was in the colonies that the grid plan was extensively implemented, first in Mexico and later in the Philippines because in the colonies the conquistadors found raw and clear land where they could project their vision of the ideal city. Always, the center of the gridiron plan was an open space, the main plaza. Around the main plaza rose the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">cathedral</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\">government buildings</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\">houses of ranking persons</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manila became the capital of the colony and the model for town development. It was the geographic center of the colony, for the cross on the dome of the cathedral was the point from which distances were measured. With the influx of colonial officials, friars, missionaries, and traders, Manila became the center of political, religious, and economic power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early years of their settlement in Manila, the Spaniards built churches and houses of wood and bamboo, but these were destroyed by fire. It became necessary to scout around for fireproof material. With the discovery of volcanic tuff quarries in San Pedro, Makati in the 1580s, the Spaniards began to construct dwellings, churches, and fortifications in stone. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a>, a Jesuit priest and engineer, trained local workmen in the art of building with stone. Probably the oldest existing stone building in the Philippines is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a>, which has survived all earthquakes from the 17th century to the present. It is said to rest on an inverted vault foundation that makes it float, so to speak, during earthquakes. In general, Spanish construction in the Philippines&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortresses</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, and civic buildings&mdash;faithfully followed European models, especially when projects were closely supervised by Spaniards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To facilitate the work of Church and State, specifically the preaching of the Gospel and the administration of the colony, towns were established and the scattered population was brought together in compact communities or <strong>reducciones</strong>. Missions and parishes were founded and churches were built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church was built in the center of the town by the town plaza. It had its own plaza surrounded by a catenated or swayback wall. Shrines called <strong>capillas posas</strong> stood at each corner of the churchyard or around the church site. Although the capillas were standard in the colonial churches of 16th century Mexico, they were not common in the Philippines. Adjacent to the church was the <strong>convento</strong>, the residence of the parish priest. The church of the colonial era is generally rectangular or cruciform in plan. Its walls are high and thick and are supported by buttresses. Windows are usually small. Its large size and massive construction made the church a suitable place of refuge for the townspeople during pirate raids or natural calamities. Bell towers served as watchtowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Churches were made of adobe (volcanic tuff) stone, coral stone, or brick. In some churches brick and adobe were combined. A wall could consist of alternate courses of brick and adobe, or blocks of brick and adobe in a checkerboard pattern. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/393\">Tumauini Church</a>, bricks were molded with ornaments on them and were numbered to guide the bricklayers in assembling them. Cementing bricks and/or stone together was a mortar prepared from various recipes, and using different combinations of ingredients, like lime, crushed coral, crushed shells, molasses, sugar cane juice, goat&rsquo;s blood, carabao milk, egg shells, and egg white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine colonial church may be described as a plain stone box with a decorated front. The rear and side walls are plain. However, a side portal, which repeats decorative motifs of the facade, breaks the monotony. The facade often has the monopoly of exterior ornament. Columns and cornices traverse the front wall vertically and horizontally. Niches, blind arches, blind balustrades, and low relief carvings give depth, texture, and a certain cheerfulness to vast, solid expanses of wall. The ornaments may be in the classic tradition&mdash;Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, baroque, or rococo. There are occasionally Gothic, Romanesque, or Moorish trefoil arches. The native touch is also evident in the unorthodox use of classical ornaments or in the introduction of local motifs. Facades outstanding for their ornamentation are those of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao Church</a> in Iloilo, which depicts San Cristobal carrying the Infant Jesus amid lush tropical vegetation, and of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/371\">San Joaquin Church</a>, which shows the surrender of Tetuan in low relief.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early churches were of wood and bamboo, so they easily caught fire. Then stone churches were built, but with earthquakes, they caved in. Later, stone churches were provided with buttresses that came in various shapes: flat and thin, massive and rectangular, sloping, stepped, saw-toothed, barrel shaped or curved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bell towers vary in design as well as in location. In plan, the bell tower may be square, octagonal, hexagonal or, in rare instances, circular. In height, it may rise from three to five stories. It may be at some distance from the church, adjacent to it, or integrated in the facade. Some churches have two towers, a few have three. When the bell tower is attached to the church, its ground floor houses the baptistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past these churches were called Spanish, probably because they were designed by Spanish friars who were missionaries or parish priests, and the designs could have been based on pictures of European churches or on the friars&rsquo; recollections of a European church. But more and more the Filipino character of these churches has become apparent; for local artisans&mdash;native or Chinese&mdash;did not always execute the classical ornaments or the baroque or neoclassic designs according to the rules but interpreted them according to their own skill, imagination, and taste. Thus, whether instructed or so inspired, the artisans often incorporated local motifs&mdash;flowers and fruits or even a crocodile&rsquo;s head into church ornaments. In these designs, local artisans expressed something of their spirit&mdash;their simplicity and lightheartedness, and their love for abundance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also evident is the influence of Mexican colonial architecture. For instance, the layout of the church and convent around an open atrium and following a strict quadrilateral design, as seen in San Agustin in Intramuros, is far more common in Mexico than in Spain. Moreover, older Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a> from the late 17th and 18th centuries, use strong and contrasting primary colors, typical of Mexican types. For this reason, recent scholarship has preferred to speak of Hispanic rather than Spanish influence, that is, the influence of architecture as it developed in the Spanish empire rather than in Spain alone. &ldquo;Spanish,&rdquo; however, is still used to designate an era or time frame, like the &ldquo;Spanish colonial era.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the realm of domestic architecture, the 19th-century townhouse, called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house), was a product of economic and social developments, as well as of architectural evolution. With the opening of Manila to international trade in 1834 and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, trade and agricultural production rose to exhilarating heights and increased the fortunes of the native aristocracy, particularly in the provinces. Wealth became the passport to higher education not only in Manila but also in Europe. The elite or&nbsp;<em>principalia&nbsp;</em>included landowners and traders, as well as professionals&mdash;physicians and accountants&mdash;and the highly educated, cosmopolitan&nbsp;<em>ilustrado</em>. The lifestyle, aspirations, and even pretensions, of the upper class demanded a new type of dwelling that was spacious, durable, comfortable, impressive, noble, and elegant&mdash;the bahay na bato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several house forms contributed to the emergence of the bahay na bato. One of its ancestors is the bahay kubo, which in itself might not have been a worthy dwelling for the ilustrado, but whose principles of design were too practical to be ignored. The steep hip roof, elevated quarters, post-and-lintel construction, and maximized ventilation are features of the bahay kubo that appear in grand style in the bahay na bato. A second ancestor may have been the native chieftain&rsquo;s house described by Antonio de Morga in the 17th century, which was elevated, sturdily built of timber, well-furnished; and spacious (having many rooms). A third influence may have been the houses of the Spanish residents of Intramuros, who combined the native and the foreign styles of building in their two-story houses with wooden posts and beams, stone walls around the ground floor, and timber construction above. Finally, another model for the bahay na bato may have been the convento, rectory, or monastery built adjacent to the mission church, an authoritative presence in the center of the town which must have antedated the bahay na bato. Extravagantly spacious and solidly built, it could have become the local standard for grandeur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the bahay na bato may be described as a house with wooden legs and a stone skirt, a style of construction which makes the house a sure survivor of earthquakes. The wooden frame gives it both flexibility and stability, while the one-story high stone wall is less likely to collapse. Large wooden posts are sunk into the ground but stand high enough to carry the roof. The posts are independent of both the stone wall below and the wooden walls above. Because they are of exceptionally precious hardwood, they are worth displaying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A distinct floor plan may be observed within. The living quarters are elevated and are reached through an interior stairway located in the <strong>zaguan</strong> on the ground floor. The zaguan, with its naked stonework, is a grim entrance hall but, with its abundant space, is the perfect storeroom for just about anything. The stairs are not only a means of access but also the setting for a stately arrival. A surrounding balustrade detached from the wall provides room all around for welcoming committees and prolonged farewells. The stairs lead up to the <strong>caida</strong> (upper entrance hall). Opening to the caida is the <strong>sala</strong> (living room). Bedrooms flank the sala and nearby is the dining room. At the rear of the house are the kitchen and next to it, is the <strong>azotea</strong>. Running along the front and sides of the house and flanking the major rooms is the <strong>volada</strong>, a gallery which protects the rooms from the heat of the sun. Along the volada is an elaborate system of windows. The broad, massive window sill is grooved and holds two sets of sliding shutters: a set of <strong>capiz</strong> or windowpane oysters, or a set of glass-paned shutters, and a set of shutters with louvers or jalousies. Between the windowsill and the floor runs the <strong>ventanilla</strong> (small window), with sliding wooden shutters and iron grills or wooden balusters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the house, wide double doors are flung open to join each room to adjacent rooms. With all doors open, the house becomes one big hall. The interior of the bahay na bato is a striking example of space surrounded by space. Running above the partitions are panels of wooden fretwork, which allow the air within the house to circulate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay na bato represents the apex in the development of indigenous Filipino architecture, because it expands the prototypal structure of the ethnic house from a one-room dwelling to a multi-roomed house of grand scale while preserving the basic features, and because it adapts Western architectural influences to form a synthesis of native and immigrant art. In addition, the bahay na bato is a product of economic progress and cultural adaptation, and as such is a symbol of the affluent westernized Filipino. It stands as a reminder of the social situation in which it evolved, a situation which has not significantly changed even with the introduction of democracy, public education, and free enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish colonial era witnessed not only the construction of churches and civic buildings and the evolution of the bahay na bato, but also the rise of the first important architects in Philippine history. While most of the churches in the provinces were planned and designed by the friars, the bahay na bato were probably the result of architectural collaboration between the homeowner, the master carpenter, and the chief mason. There were, however, professional architects who were active in the 19th century, particularly in Manila. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>, a Spaniard, designed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">Taal Church</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/329\">Malabon Church</a>, and the 1872 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>, considered the first Filipino architect, trained abroad and was renowned for his revivalist designs. His works included the neogothic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a> and the neoclassic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">San Ignacio Church</a>, both in Intramuros, and a number of elegant houses for the upper class of Manila. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2661\">Juan Hervas</a>, a Spaniard, active from the late 1880s to the early 1890s, designed the Tutuban Railroad Station, the Monte de Piedad Building, the old Assumption Convent on Herran Street and a number of houses. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a>, a trained <strong>maestro de obras</strong> (master builder), was appointed architectural adviser to Gov William Howard Taft in 1901 and is known for the gothic-revival house of the Hidalgo family and the art nouveau Bautista-Nakpil house. Genaro Palacios designed the prefabricated all-steel <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/374\">San Sebastian Church</a> in the 1880s. In the middle of the 19th century, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2689\">Bartolome Palatino</a>, a noted citizen of the wood carving town of Paete, designed and built the splendid facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">church in Morong, Rizal</a>, one of the finest examples of what can be called Filipino baroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"theamericantradition\" name=\"theamericantradition\"></a>The American Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the occupation of the Philippines by the United States in 1898, a new phase of Philippine architectural history began. In accordance with America&rsquo;s thrust towards establishing an American-style government, urban planning and architecture served the needs of secular education and public services. In 1904, American architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a> came to the Philippines to conduct a survey of Manila and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a> to prepare development plans for both cities. Burnham was one of the architects of the 1893 Chicago Exposition which, under the influence of the Beaux Arts School of Paris, revived the neoclassic style of architecture. Burnham admired the bahay na bato and the colonial churches for their practicality and charm, and suggested that they be models for future development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burnham&rsquo;s recommendations for the development of Manila included the establishment of a government center with streets radiating from it; the retention, cleaning, and improvement of the&nbsp;<em>esteros&nbsp;</em>or canals; the construction of a bay shore boulevard from Manila to Cavite; the development of parks and waterfronts; and the provision of sites for major public facilities, such as schools and hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among those assigned to implement the Burnham plan was American architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William E. Parsons</a>. Parsons followed Burnham&rsquo;s recommendation that a style of architecture be developed to suit the tropical climate. Parson&rsquo;s major works include the Normal School (now Philippine Normal University), the Philippine General Hospital, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army-Navy Club</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These buildings and others of the early 20th century represented the thrust of American colonial policy in the Philippines&mdash;health, public education, free enterprise, and training in self-government. In contrast to the romantic air of colonial architecture, early 20th-century architecture in the Philippines was rational, functional, and seemingly plain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Young Filipinos who went or were sent to the United States for training in various fields included 25 aspiring architects. They studied in American universities and institutes which were then under the influence of the Beaux-Arts School of Paris. Among the US-trained Filipino architects of the early 20th century were Carlos Barreto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2702\">Antonio Toledo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>. They became exponents of the neoclassic style and designed buildings characterized by monumental scale and fidelity to tradition. Since they were employed in the government which was engaged in a nationwide building program, their influence on the architecture of the time was extensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True to his classical training, Arellano designed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Manila Post Office Building</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a> following the canons of Greco-Roman architecture. Although a disciplined classicist, Arellano experimented with romanticism and brilliantly succeeded in producing the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> in 1931. With art deco motifs, stylized interpretation of native plants, and a variety of color and texture, the Metropolitan, even decades after its design, is a refreshing piece of architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 20th century, new house forms developed. But the basic design was still the house on stilts. Following the tone set by Parsons and turning away from the ornaments of the bahay na bato, the suburban house called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\"><strong>tsalet</strong></a> (chalet) was comfortably functional and, in many cases, plain. A prominent feature of the house was the front porch or the surrounding porch. Some houses were entered through an exterior L- or T-shaped concrete or wooden stairway. The chalet was a simple, respectable house for those moving up to the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architecture for the technological age was anticipated by the prefabricated, all-steel structure of San Sebastian Church built in 1891, and by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/394\">University of Santo Tomas (UST) Main Building</a> built in 1927, which is impressive not only for its monumental proportions but for its earthquake-proof construction. The latter consists of 24 separate sections with soft material, like tar, serving as cushions at the joints. During an earthquake, the walls do not crack, having been pre-cracked, as it were. The all-steel church and the earthquake-proof building foreshadowed further technological developments in construction, specifically, more extensive use of steel, daring structural design, and more imaginative use of reinforced concrete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the first generation of 20th-century Filipino architects firmly held on to tradition, the succeeding generation broke away from it and introduced a new style. The 1930s were a time for looking forward more confidently to national independence. The period marked the emergence of the Filipino business magnate, who rose from rags to riches in the heady atmosphere of free enterprise. The developing economy demanded new types of buildings like commercial office buildings, hotels, apartments, movie houses, and homes for the upper class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Into this environment of progress and experiment, the young architects <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a> made an auspicious entrance. Luna, son of painter and national hero <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>, was an exponent of the art deco style. Among his existing works is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\">Perez-Samanillo Building</a> on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>. Ocampo likewise was notable for his art deco buildings, among them the Central Seminary of the UST. Nakpil&rsquo;s early works in the art deco style include the Avenue Theater and Hotel Building and the Quezon Institute Buildings. Antonio&rsquo;s works were marked by a bold spirit, the play of planes and volumes, and strong, dynamic movement. His works include the Far Eastern University Main Building, the Bel-Air Apartments on Roxas Blvd, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5618\">Ramon Roces Publications</a> Building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern architecture in the Philippines was a departure from the neoclassic Beaux-Arts tradition, but like the local neoclassic, it was still a product of foreign influence, a transplant from the West. While it was hailed as innovation, it was basically a new conformism to western trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"postwar\" name=\"postwar\"></a>The Postwar Developments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the World War II, Manila was in ruins. The irreplaceable treasure that was Intramuros was reduced to rubble. The once magnificent government buildings were bombed-out shells. Hasty reconstruction resulted in makeshift structures with false fronts. The atrocities of war were followed by the atrocities of reconstruction. While the established architects resumed their practice, new graduates emerged in time for the building boom that followed the war. The neoclassic government buildings that lay in ruins were rebuilt following their original plans. Reconstruction continued into the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, new government and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/224\">commercial buildings</a> departed from the neoclassic and art deco of the previous decades and sought fresh inspiration in the work of contemporary Western architects. The <strong>sunbreak</strong>, made popular by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, became the object of extensive and even irrational imitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the increased volume of construction, real estate development grew in scale and began to be planned more rationally. Upper-class and middle-class villages and state housing projects signified recognition of the need for planned communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While early 20th-century Filipino houses had developed from indigenous architecture, postwar houses marked a departure from the native tradition. The break had been indicated earlier in the emergence of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/246\">two-story house</a> in which living quarters occupied both first and second floors. In the bahay na bato, the living quarters were on the upper floor. The lower floor was a storage area. The tsalet of the early American regime followed the same scheme. The so-called Spanish-style house&mdash;with tile roofs, arches, and the indispensable three-story tower&mdash;began to appear in the 1930s and became the badge of the bourgeoisie for the next three decades. After the war came the one-story California <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\"><strong>bungalow</strong></a> with picture windows, lanai (borrowed from Hawaii), and a two-to-three-car garage. This new status symbol represented the Americanization of the Filipino house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the appreciation of things Philippine ushered in by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/56\">folk dance</a> revival, the interest in various folk arts and the rage for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">santos</a>, antique <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a>, and other colonial artifacts, many houses of contemporary style have looked back to native tradition, incorporating such features as steep-hip roofs, wooden lattices, capiz screens, and decorative woodwork, probably out of nostalgia or, hopefully, nationalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In earlier years low-cost urban housing was provided by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong>accesoria</strong></a> or wooden row house, which survives in many old sections of Manila. Two-story units, each 3-4 m wide, stood crowded together, with openings in front and at the back and, if fortunate, a small backyard. Government housing projects built after the war provided one-story, cement-block dwellings, either detached from or joined with others and set on small individual lots. With the Filipino penchant for remodeling, many of these pitifully plain units have metamorphosed into charming examples of personalized architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multistory tenements, an alternative response to the need for mass housing, were nothing more than row houses extended horizontally and vertically. The Bagong Lipunan Sites and Services (BLISS) houses, a legacy of the Marcos regime, are multiple-unit, multistory buildings that take into account the decreasing availability of land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even with the housing projects of the government, there are still not enough dwellings for the low-income group and the urban poor. The growth of the urban population, resulting from a high birth rate and uncontrolled migration from the rural areas, has exceeded the government&rsquo;s capacity to provide adequate housing. Occupying whatever space is available&mdash;along railroad tracks, along or right over esteros, around garbage dumps, under bridges, along the sea wall, inside abandoned buildings, on any unguarded vacant lot&mdash;the urban poor have built their rickety one-room shanties called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\"><strong>barong-barong</strong></a>, using discarded materials, cardboard boxes, rusty roofing sheets, and rotten wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philamlife Homes in Quezon City, a fine example of middle-class housing built in the 1950s, was noteworthy for its simple yet attractive houses, many of which have been remodelled beyond recognition. Its well-planned arrangement is distinguished by an organic layout; i.e., its streets follow the contour of the land. Upper-class residential architecture is represented by both sprawling houses on spacious gardens in the plush villages and the deluxe air-conditioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">apartments</a> in high-rise condominiums. Lower in the scale of luxury, the townhouses of the rising bourgeoisie are sophisticated versions of the urban row house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grandeur, or just plain bigness, in architecture is a function of autocratic government or corporate omnipotence. The splendid architecture of Rome, for instance, was the work of the emperors, the popes, and Benito Mussolini. The skyscrapers of New York are glittering monuments to big business and imperialism. Martial law and the rule of the Marcoses was the setting of massive and monumental construction in Metro Manila never witnessed before in the country. The North Diversion Road, the South Superhighway, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Main Building</a>, the Manila Film Center, the Folk Arts Theater, the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC), the five-star hotels, the Batasang Pambansa, the Philippine Heart Center, the Lung Center, the Central Bank Buildings, the Philippine National Bank and Government Service Insurance System Buildings at the reclamation area, and the restoration of the walls and gates of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> were all possible only under a monopoly of power maintained by extravagant spending for the sake of political impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rivalry for supremacy in business is evident in the ubiquitous malls, superbuildings that accommodate under one roof supermarkets, department stores, bookstores, boutiques, restaurants, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">movie houses</a>, amusement centers, and drugstores. With land rising in value, the use of urban space is maximized through vertical expansion&mdash;upwards, with taller buildings, and downwards, with deeper multilevel basements. Until the 1950s the height of buildings was restricted by ordinance to 30 m or about 10 stories. But since the development of Makati, high-rise buildings have exceeded that limit, going up to 20 floors and now going beyond 40.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coming of age in contemporary Philippine architecture is evident in such buildings as the National Press Club, Philamlife Home Office, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/365\">Magsaysay Memorial</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/373\">San Miguel Corporation Head Office</a>, Twin Towers, Ritz Towers, Pacific Plaza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">CCP Main Building</a>, Philippine Plaza Hotel, PICC, Pacific Star, Meralco, Tahanang Pilipino, and many others constructed since the 1960s. All these testify to the genius and maturity of their architects. It is no longer enough for architects to design efficiently organized and aesthetically satisfying space. They also have to take into account the complex technology that will go into it: elevator and escalator systems, air-conditioning, fire-protection systems, and computers. While adapting architecture to the demands of technology, architects realized that architecture must also be a reflection of culture and an embodiment of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until the 1997 economic crash, the ASEAN countries, including the Philippines, were experiencing rapid economic growth, resulting in the construction of high-rise multi-use buildings, offices, and residences. Moreover, the opening of the Philippine economy to international investments spurred a competition among ASEAN nations in getting foreign investments. As the Philippine market opened to an international clientele of investors and clients, not just new structures were built but new areas that are like satellite cities near the major urban center. With the Bases Conversion Act, unused or underused military bases were given to private developers. While giving the government added income, these bases are clean slates where new centers, composed of high-rise multi-use buildings, may be found. In Metro Manila, such an example is the former site of Fort Bonifacio. In Cebu, the area south of Cebu City in the direction of Talisay is being redeveloped, as well as the area north beyond Mandaue City. Iloilo&rsquo;s redevelopment has as its catalyst the development of the old airport site at Mandurriao, which is being linked by a wide highway to the new airport in the boundaries of Santa Barbara.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In these new areas, the recognizable foreign architect and architectural firm are marketing assets. Often working with a local counterpart, the foreign architect gives visibility to the project. To create a magnet for investments, it was not enough to build using designs by homegrown talent; international talent was needed. Thus, the era of the iconic building and the equally iconic international architect was ushered in around the year 1987. The Essensa tower in Fort Bonifacio, designed by American architect I. M. Pei, is an early example of this trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, with the opening of the Philippines in the 21st century to the global market through membership in the World Trade Organization and the increasing demand to compete with the region and to benchmark with best international practices, Philippine architecture faces the challenge of being global without losing its unique identity. But while such affiliation is seen as a beneficial economic move, it also has less than positive implications. While creating markets for Philippine products and produce, it has also opened the Philippines to international trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imported building materials coming from China, Europe, and the United States have flooded the Philippine market. Sold by large-scale construction supply companies that have eased out the small neighborhood hardware stores, building materials like fiber cement board, gypsum boards, insulation, PVC tubing for water and electricity, glazed tiles, polished granite of various colors and other building materials have become increasingly available and affordable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the late 1970s and 1980s trend to build structures that reflect Philippine heritage spurred local industries that produced &ldquo;Vigan tiles&rdquo; or terra cotta tiles and &ldquo;Mactan stones&rdquo; or cut limestone facing blocks, these homegrown materials have been eased out by the more durable and easy to install glazed tiles, faux stones, and other finishing material imported into the Philippines. The decline of demand for Mactan stones may be seen as a positive development because quarrying destroyed the karsts and ancient coral deposits of the Philippines, but it also meant an end to the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another development that challenges the Filipinizing trend of the 1970s and 1980s is an unexpected result of the Philippines&rsquo; massive export of labor to foreign markets. The returning overseas foreign workers have seen how other peoples live in foreign lands. Some have married foreigners and return to the Philippines after their contract period is over or for retirement. Also, foreigners who have married into Filipino families often build resorts, especially in the Visayas and coastal areas with good beaches. In what they build, something of Europe or the United States&nbsp;is recreated. In a parallel development, catering to the mobile and cosmopolitan market for mobile Filipinos and expats are real estate development companies building what may be called fantasy resorts and developments. The result of the two trends&mdash;returning OFWs and the projects of real estate companies&mdash;is the introduction of foreign styles of architecture without any historical roots in the Philippines. Thus, resorts are built in the style of Santorini Island&rsquo;s domed blue and white building of the Aegean. Balinese architecture is also used in resorts. On the shores of Lake Sebu in South Cotabato is a Swiss chalet and on the hill above <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">Baclayon Church</a> is a German chateau. On the southern coast of Iloilo, the vernacular bahay kubo are being replaced by pastiches of foreign styles, like Mediterranean, Italian, or whatever pleases the many Ilonggo who spend months working and saving in foreign maritime trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"prospects\" name=\"prospects\"></a>Prospects for Filipino Architecture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Filipino architects becoming more at ease in the modern idiom and more aware of the Filipino&rsquo;s search for cultural identity, they became more concerned with questions like: Is there such a thing as Filipino architecture? Were the works of Filipino architects mere imitations of Western models? Would a modern Filipino architecture eventually develop? And the questions are valid. For the art and science of architecture is not only a response to human needs&mdash;the need for shelter, the need for order, the need for beauty, and the need for a sense of transcendence. It is also, fundamentally, a search for identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this continuing search for architectural identity, the variety of houses and buildings that have emerged through centuries of Philippine history, from one end of the archipelago to the other, yield common characteristics that should be considered by young architects concerned with a Philippine style of architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One feature of the Filipino house, and hence, of Filipino architecture, is the concept of space and the interrelation of different spaces like outdoor and indoor space, and the various areas of indoor space. An interior space is a space surrounded by space. Rooms open to adjacent rooms, or within a room, different spaces are created by means of levels or visual dividers. Space becomes a place for gathering or for solitude while remaining integrated. It is a function of personal relations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in a tropical climate, a house must breathe. Thus, transparency has become a feature of the Filipino house. It allows for cross ventilation or better circulation of air. Transparency also arises from the relation of spaces. Even when interior space is well covered and protected, the character of transparency is somehow expressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there is the lightheartedness of the Filipino, which is reflected in the visual lightness of architecture. A structure appears to be a floating volume. Massive structures are treated in such a way that they look light. In addition, the Filipino&mdash;who lives in a lush baroque landscape&mdash;seems not to be comfortable with empty space or plain, unadorned surfaces. Space has to be filled, or broken up, or at least, be the setting for texture. Lastly, the play of space, visual lightness, and transparency of structure and texture all contribute to a spirit of festivity, or better still, of tropical festivity. Filipinos love their fiestas, and architecture becomes one of their forms of celebration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The search for form and identity must further consider new conditions and directions. The vastly increased population of the country demands that today&rsquo;s architecture be concerned not only with the design of individual buildings, but also with the design of communities. This means more than mass housing. It means creating communities that are economically self-sufficient, environmentally safe and healthy, and adequately provided with services, such as schools and hospitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the city expands its population with youth migrants from the rural areas and as it devours land for its infrastructure and megaprojects, will there still be space for every needy person to have a decent dwelling? Or shall one have to accept, as inevitable, living in one small compartment of an urban honeycomb? The single dwelling anchored to the ground signifies respect for the individuality of the occupant, while the multi-dwelling complex stresses the need for community. Architects are challenged to create the kind of dwelling that fosters one&rsquo;s solidarity with the land and with neighbors. The larger task for architecture today is to create new communities for the poor and, in so doing, raise them from the inhumanity of poverty to a way of life worthy of their human dignity. Architecture for the poor will help to answer the long urgent need to redesign communities and transform the social order.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

Houses and monuments from Batanes to Tawi-Tawi not only represent different cultures and periods in Philippine history, they also constitute the Filipino&#x2019;s creative response to the problems posed by the geography and climate of the archipelago. The 7,641 islands of the Philippines appear to be a mountain range that is half submerged. More than half of the land is mountainous and hilly. With their headwaters in the mountains, rivers flow down to the plains and out to the sea. For its relatively small area of 301,780 sq km, the country has an extensive coastline of 36,289 km. On this fragmented territory and rugged terrain, on mountain, plain, riverbank, and seacoast, the people have made their home. With its southernmost islands about four degrees from the equator, and its northern and central islands in the path of typhoons, the Philippines is subject to the worst of tropical heat, humidity, and rain. A long dry season can bring drought, rains can cause floods, and high winds can ruin houses. Several times a year, the land is rocked by earthquakes. Yet, as the climate dictates the need for shelter, the land provides the <a href=\"/2/6/253\">materials</a> for it: wood from the forests, bamboo from groves, leaves from the fields, stone from rivers and quarries, and clay from the earth itself. Setting, climate, and available materials are among the factors that give shelter its form and character."

It was nature that fashioned hollows on cliffs and mountainsides that offered protection from heat, rain, and wind. In Binangonan, Rizal evidence of ancient cave dwellers exists in carved figures on cave walls known as the Angono-Binangonan&#xA0;Petroglyphs, the earliest known Philippine mural. The <a href=\"/2/8/386\">Tabon Cave</a> in Palawan yielded the earliest-known remains of human beings in the Philippines dated to about 37,000 years ago."

Thus, they fashioned the <a href=\"/2/5/229\">lean-to</a> from a frame made of tree branches and twigs, using leaves and fronds for sidings. A screen resting on the ground and held up at an angle by one or several poles, the lean-to is both roof and wall, protecting dwellers from rain and the heat of the sun. The floor can be the ground itself or a bed of leaves or a platform slightly above the ground. The lean-to is light enough to be carried to another site. However, the dweller can simply abandon it and build another. A pair of lean-tos can be joined together to form a tent-like shelter or a double-slope roof, which, in effect, is the beginning of a house."

Although the communal house is occupied by several families, its interior is not divided by partitions. The area for each family is defined by a mat on the floor. When a Mangyan house is built on a slope, the entrance faces the rise. The steep roof is of cogon grass, the sidings, of tree bark, and the floor, of logs and saplings. The house appears to have no windows. However, it has a narrow strip of opening between roof and wall."

				"value": "The one-room Ifugao house, known as <strong>fale</strong>, is a little marvel of construction. Outside, the Ifugao house seems to be nothing more than a pyramid resting on four posts. The interior space&#x2014; enclosed by slanting walls, sloping roof, and ceiling formed by the loft&#x2014;appears nearly spherical. The dark, windowless chamber suggests a womb. Four wooden posts rest on a pavement and support two wooden girders that, in turn, support three wooden transverse joists. On the posts are wooden discs that prevent rats from entering the house. The ladder is drawn up at night or is hung across the front when the occupants are away. The floor joists, floor sills, vertical studs, and horizontal beams at about head level form a cage that rests on the posts and girders. Floorboards are fitted between the joists. Wooden sidings slant outward and rise to waist height to form the lower half of the wall. The upper half of the wall is formed by the inner side of the roof. Boards flanking the front and rear doors rise to the beams. The rafters of the roof rest on the beams and extend downward close to floor level. The roof frame is sheathed with reed like <strong>runo</strong> (cane grass) then covered with thatch. At an inner corner of the house is the fireplace. At the level of the beam is a storage loft with a floor of runo stalks. The wooden parts of this house are joined by rabbeting and by mortise and tenon. Other parts are fastened by lashing. Since nails are not used, the house can easily be dismantled, carried to a new site, and reassembled. The solitary room is the sleeping room, kitchen, dining room, storeroom, and shrine for rituals. Only the husband and wife and children in infancy live in this house. Upon reaching the age of reason, sons and daughters sleep in separate communal dormitories. Next to this house stands its twin, a granary with the same design as the house."

With the smooth, fine-grained hardwood posts, rat guards are not necessary. The elevated living space in the fale becomes a granary in the Bontok house, as the living quarters move down to ground level. A low wall encloses the ground floor. The four-post, two-girder, and three-joist structure of the Ifugao is also used in the Bontok house. The Sagada house resembles the Bontok house but is fully covered. It is a wooden box with a steep thatch roof as a lid. With the granary within, the Sagada house is a &#x201C;house within a house.&#x201D; The <a href=\"/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a> house is still another variation of the Ifugao prototype. The roof is higher and wider, thereby providing a spacious loft above the living space. On the ground level wooden planks are laid to provide additional livable space. The <a href=\"/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a> house has a larger room, a flaring roof, and a small porch. Some of the Kalinga live in octagonal houses. The central portion of the octagonal house rests on a four-post, two-girder, and three-joist structure. Beyond this frame eight posts are added to form the eight sides of the house. Wooden laths resting on joists support the runo floor, which can be rolled up like a mat and taken to the river for washing."

The Isneg house has two sets of posts: the inner set supporting the floor and the outer set supporting the roof. As in the Kalinga house, the floor can be rolled up. The walls are vertical boards set into grooves that are cut into beams at floor and roof-eaves level. A window is created by simply taking out a few boards. All the wallboards can be removed to make the house a roofed platform for village celebrations. The Isneg house is the largest among the Cordillera houses, since the entire family, and even married offspring&#x2019;s spouses, could live in it. It is not known when and how Cordillera houses developed into their present forms. However, these house forms developed in isolation and were untouched by Western influence, for the Spanish colonizers did not succeed in bringing the region and its people under their rule."

The roof is of dried grass, the walls of woven bamboo, and the posts of whole bamboo and, occasionally, tree stumps. The central portion of the floor is slightly lower than the areas around it. The side sections are for working or resting. At one end are the entrance and the fireplace, and at the other is the place of honor for the head of the house. The interior of the Tboli house is one example of a characteristic feature of Philippine houses&#x2014;space surrounded by space."

A site is considered lucky if it is flat and dry or if it gently slopes westward&#x2014;towards Mecca. The traditional Tausug house rests on nine posts, each signifying a part of the body&#x2014;the neck, navel, groin, left and right sides of the shoulders, ribs, and hips. Basically a one-room house, the Tausug dwelling includes a porch and a separate kitchen. A distinguishing feature of the house is an elaborately carved wooden finial, called <strong>tajuk pasung</strong>, placed at one or both ends of the roof ridge."

The sea is their source of livelihood, the link to other people, and the place for celebration. It is also home. The Sama build their houses on stilts over the water, along the shore or farther out, grouped together in villages and connected by bridges and catwalks. Unlike the Sama house, the Sama Dilaut land house stands alone on an expanse of water and is reached only by boat. It is not joined by bridges or catwalks to the shore or to other houses. It is an island made by humans."

The earliest mosque in the Philippines is said to have been built in 1380 in Simunul Island, Tawi-Tawi. At present, mosques in the Philippines follow the traditional Middle East design which includes an onion-shaped dome and minarets. However, some mosques are closer to indigenous architecture, with a multi-tiered roof resembling that of a pagoda."

				"value": "The Muslim chief resides in the <a href=\"/2/5/229\"><strong>torogan</strong></a>, a huge, stately, towering house, with a single large room. Although torogan simply means a place for sleeping, the house is more than a residence. It is also used for official meetings, social gatherings, and religious rituals. Only the chief, the sultan, or datu is entitled to own and live in a torogan. The soaring, flaring roof, like a ceremonial umbrella, is a proclamation of exalted status. The massive posts serve as solid supports and signify established power. To protect the house from earthquakes, the oversized posts rest on stones. With this device, the house sways with the tremor, playfully surviving it. Posts may be plain and bulky or may be carved to look like clay pots or outsized chess pieces. The most arresting feature of the torogan is the set of protruding beam-ends, called <strong>panolong</strong>. Flaring out from the facade, intricately carved, and stunningly colored, the panolong resembles a boat&#x2019;s prows and makes the splendid torogan appear to float like a royal barge."

They are all related to the <a href=\"/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut), which in its simplicity is regarded as a prototype. Largely of bamboo and thatch, and with parts woven, fitted or tied together, the bahay kubo might be described as less of a building and more of a basket. While posts, beams, and joists are assembled, the roof is put together separately and later fitted on top like the lid of a basket. The bamboo floor, with its slats set slightly apart, is like the bottom of a basket and makes for incomparable ventilation. With air coming in through windows and floor and the crevices in thatch and bamboo walls, the bahay kubo is a house that breathes."

With the frequency of high winds and strong rain, the Batanes house is built to hug the ground. Thick stone walls and a thick grass roof withstand the severest storm. The roof is supported by posts encased in the stone walls. Stone and mortar construction was introduced in the Batanes islands during the Spanish regime."

The city was provided with a principal plaza and secondary plazas. Streets were laid out in a gridiron pattern. This pattern, known in Spanish as&#xA0;<em>quadricula</em>, was an innovation in urban design, proposed by Renaissance architects and theoreticians, as the ideal shape of the city. It was in the colonies that the grid plan was extensively implemented, first in Mexico and later in the Philippines because in the colonies the conquistadors found raw and clear land where they could project their vision of the ideal city. Always, the center of the gridiron plan was an open space, the main plaza. Around the main plaza rose the <a href=\"/2/5/244\">cathedral</a>, <a href=\"/2/5/223\">government buildings</a>, and the <a href=\"/2/5/220\">houses of ranking persons</a>."

Thus, whether instructed or so inspired, the artisans often incorporated local motifs&#x2014;flowers and fruits or even a crocodile&#x2019;s head into church ornaments.

With the opening of Manila to international trade in 1834 and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, trade and agricultural production rose to exhilarating heights and increased the fortunes of the native aristocracy, particularly in the provinces. Wealth became the passport to higher education not only in Manila but also in Europe.

One of its ancestors is the bahay kubo, which in itself might not have been a worthy dwelling for the ilustrado, but whose principles of design were too practical to be ignored. The steep hip roof, elevated quarters, post-and-lintel construction, and maximized ventilation are features of the bahay kubo that appear in grand style in the bahay na bato. A second ancestor may have been the native chieftain&#x2019;s house described by Antonio de Morga in the 17th century, which was elevated, sturdily built of timber, well-furnished; and spacious (having many rooms). A third influence may have been the houses of the Spanish residents of Intramuros, who combined the native and the foreign styles of building in their two-story houses with wooden posts and beams, stone walls around the ground floor, and timber construction above. Finally, another model for the bahay na bato may have been the convento, rectory, or monastery built adjacent to the mission church, an authoritative presence in the center of the town which must have antedated the bahay na bato. Extravagantly spacious and solidly built, it could have become the local standard for grandeur."

Large wooden posts are sunk into the ground but stand high enough to carry the roof. The posts are independent of both the stone wall below and the wooden walls above.

The stairs are not only a means of access but also the setting for a stately arrival. A surrounding balustrade detached from the wall provides room all around for welcoming committees and prolonged farewells. The stairs lead up to the <strong>caida</strong> (upper entrance hall).

Along the volada is an elaborate system of windows. The broad, massive window sill is grooved and holds two sets of sliding shutters: a set of <strong>capiz</strong> or windowpane oysters, or a set of glass-paned shutters, and a set of shutters with louvers or jalousies.

In addition, the bahay na bato is a product of economic progress and cultural adaptation, and as such is a symbol of the affluent westernized Filipino.

There were, however, professional architects who were active in the 19th century, particularly in Manila. <a href=\"/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>, a Spaniard, designed the <a href=\"/2/8/385\">Taal Church</a>, the <a href=\"/2/8/329\">Malabon Church</a>, and the 1872 <a href=\"/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>. <a href=\"/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>, considered the first Filipino architect, trained abroad and was renowned for his revivalist designs. His works included the neogothic <a href=\"/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a> and the neoclassic <a href=\"/2/8/370\">San Ignacio Church</a>, both in Intramuros, and a number of elegant houses for the upper class of Manila. <a href=\"/2/11/2661\">Juan Hervas</a>, a Spaniard, active from the late 1880s to the early 1890s, designed the Tutuban Railroad Station, the Monte de Piedad Building, the old Assumption Convent on Herran Street and a number of houses. <a href=\"/2/2/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a>, a trained <strong>maestro de obras</strong> (master builder), was appointed architectural adviser to Gov William Howard Taft in 1901 and is known for the gothic-revival house of the Hidalgo family and the art nouveau Bautista-Nakpil house. Genaro Palacios designed the prefabricated all-steel <a href=\"/2/8/374\">San Sebastian Church</a> in the 1880s. In the middle of the 19th century, <a href=\"/2/11/2689\">Bartolome Palatino</a>, a noted citizen of the wood carving town of Paete, designed and built the splendid facade of the <a href=\"/2/8/345\">church in Morong, Rizal</a>, one of the finest examples of what can be called Filipino baroque."

The decline of demand for Mactan stones may be seen as a positive development because quarrying destroyed the karsts and ancient coral deposits of the Philippines, but it also meant an end to the industry."

				"value": "Another development that challenges the Filipinizing trend of the 1970s and 1980s is an unexpected result of the Philippines&#x2019; massive export of labor to foreign markets. The returning overseas foreign workers have seen how other peoples live in foreign lands. Some have married foreigners and return to the Philippines after their contract period is over or for retirement. Also, foreigners who have married into Filipino families often build resorts, especially in the Visayas and coastal areas with good beaches. In what they build, something of Europe or the United States&#xA0;is recreated. In a parallel development, catering to the mobile and cosmopolitan market for mobile Filipinos and expats are real estate development companies building what may be called fantasy resorts and developments. The result of the two trends&#x2014;returning OFWs and the projects of real estate companies&#x2014;is the introduction of foreign styles of architecture without any historical roots in the Philippines. Thus, resorts are built in the style of Santorini Island&#x2019;s domed blue and white building of the Aegean. Balinese architecture is also used in resorts. On the shores of Lake Sebu in South Cotabato is a Swiss chalet and on the hill above <a href=\"/2/8/268\">Baclayon Church</a> is a German chateau. On the southern coast of Iloilo, the vernacular bahay kubo are being replaced by pastiches of foreign styles, like Mediterranean, Italian, or whatever pleases the many Ilonggo who spend months working and saving in foreign maritime trade."

				"value": "With Filipino architects becoming more at ease in the modern idiom and more aware of the Filipino&#x2019;s search for cultural identity, they became more concerned with questions like: Is there such a thing as Filipino architecture? Were the works of Filipino architects mere imitations of Western models? Would a modern Filipino architecture eventually develop? And the questions are valid. For the art and science of architecture is not only a response to human needs&#x2014;the need for shelter, the need for order, the need for beauty, and the need for a sense of transcendence. It is also, fundamentally, a search for identity."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In this continuing search for architectural identity, the variety of houses and buildings that have emerged through centuries of Philippine history, from one end of the archipelago to the other, yield common characteristics that should be considered by young architects concerned with a Philippine style of architecture."

				"value": "One feature of the Filipino house, and hence, of Filipino architecture, is the concept of space and the interrelation of different spaces like outdoor and indoor space, and the various areas of indoor space. An interior space is a space surrounded by space. Rooms open to adjacent rooms, or within a room, different spaces are created by means of levels or visual dividers. Space becomes a place for gathering or for solitude while remaining integrated. It is a function of personal relations."

Transparency also arises from the relation of spaces. Even when interior space is well covered and protected, the character of transparency is somehow expressed."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Then there is the lightheartedness of the Filipino, which is reflected in the visual lightness of architecture. A structure appears to be a floating volume. Massive structures are treated in such a way that they look light. In addition, the Filipino&#x2014;who lives in a lush baroque landscape&#x2014;seems not to be comfortable with empty space or plain, unadorned surfaces. Space has to be filled, or broken up, or at least, be the setting for texture. Lastly, the play of space, visual lightness, and transparency of structure and texture all contribute to a spirit of festivity, or better still, of tropical festivity. Filipinos love their fiestas, and architecture becomes one of their forms of celebration."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The search for form and identity must further consider new conditions and directions. The vastly increased population of the country demands that today&#x2019;s architecture be concerned not only with the design of individual buildings, but also with the design of communities. This means more than mass housing. It means creating communities that are economically self-sufficient, environmentally safe and healthy, and adequately provided with services, such as schools and hospitals."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "As the city expands its population with youth migrants from the rural areas and as it devours land for its infrastructure and megaprojects, will there still be space for every needy person to have a decent dwelling? Or shall one have to accept, as inevitable, living in one small compartment of an urban honeycomb? The single dwelling anchored to the ground signifies respect for the individuality of the occupant, while the multi-dwelling complex stresses the need for community. Architects are challenged to create the kind of dwelling that fosters one&#x2019;s solidarity with the land and with neighbors. The larger task for architecture today is to create new communities for the poor and, in so doing, raise them from the inhumanity of poverty to a way of life worthy of their human dignity. Architecture for the poor will help to answer the long urgent need to redesign communities and transform the social order.&#xA0;<span class>&#xA0;</span> "

These forms include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\">dwellings</a>, whether permanent or makeshift, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">granaries</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortifications</a>, places of worship, and other temporary structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous architecture is created by the different ethnolinguistic communities in the Philippines, from lowland communities to communities in the Cordilleras, the Visayan Islands, Mindanao, and other adjacent islands. Indigenous architecture draws inspiration mainly from the environment: specifically, the climate, terrain, vegetation, and fauna around it. It also responds to communal and social needs&mdash;the need to be safe from hostile and marauding tribes and to interact with fellow human beings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"general\" name=\"general\"></a>General Characteristics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous structures are deeply rooted in the Southeast Asian building tradition and share its characteristics, namely, pile construction, the hip or gable roof, and the use of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">materials</a> available from the environment, such as wood, vegetation, and sometimes mud. The favorite material, as in the rest of Southeast Asia, is bamboo which is used for posts, flooring, siding, roofing, and many others. Also used are coconut wood,&nbsp;<em>bakawan&nbsp;</em>or mangrove, some hardwoods, pinewood, and stones for the structure; cogon grass, coco and nipa palm, and banana bark for the roof coverings and wall sidings; rattan and other vines for fastening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous architecture is informal and intuitive, usually designed by the owner and executed with human resources provided by the family and the community. The design is often influenced first by tradition and second by chance or&nbsp;<em>oido</em>, playing by ear. Tradition dictates the general shape or form and the structural concepts, while chance enables the builder-designer-artisan to improvise and make adjustments along the way, relying on intuition and aesthetic insight to solve the problems of design and execution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\">indigenous houses</a> conform to a general pattern: they have steep thatched roofs to facilitate drainage; they are elevated on posts or stilts to temper the earth&rsquo;s dampness and humidity; they have slatted flooring to let in the cool air from below; in the lowlands they use bamboo, nipa, and cogon to keep cool, while in the uplands, they use tightly fitting solid planks to help keep in warmth. The indigenous house is generally a multipurpose one-room structure, light and airy, comfortable and functional, yet durable and structurally stable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Altogether, indigenous houses reflect the wisdom of the vernacular building tradition of a long line of skilled artisans who blend aesthetics and utility into one harmonious whole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decoration, while done sparingly, is often a happy marriage between aesthetics and socio-politico-religious factors. Pig skulls, for instance, may adorn an Ifugao house mainly for social prestige, just as carabao horns and the colorful <strong>panolong</strong>, the decorated beam-ends of Maranao houses, indicate social position. In various Philippine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/234\">mosques</a>, the crescent-and-star motif surmounting the dome serves as a symbol of Islam. In ordinary houses, the natural finish, texture, and pattern of pinewood or bamboo give aesthetic pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These houses express the indigenous way of organizing space within and without. Territorial spaces are suggested by symbols, never stated with fences or walls; these are respected by the passersby and other residents in the area. For example, one does not litter within a certain space, nor allow one&rsquo;s cows or carabaos to stray into the area. One avoids passing near a neighbor&rsquo;s window where someone may be sleeping. Within the house, even in the absence of walls or partitions, the use of different levels, mats, or a fireplace in a corner can distinguish one section from another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While privacy is generally observed within the understood limits of each area inside and outside the house, the plot of land or the designated zone at sea or along the shoreline where the houses are built remains communal property. This creates more space for the children to play and run around, and for the adults to socialize. The responsibility for maintaining the shared area&mdash;like the hill where the cluster of houses stand&mdash;rests on all the residents in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a culture that encourages maximum interaction among people, communication is largely indirect. It is accomplished through suggestions, hints, gestures, and symbols, so that messages may be decoded with ease by members of that culture. It is a culture where people work together, build houses together, eat together, and generally do things together. They are bound by the great number of rituals and festivals they celebrate together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design and construction of houses in such a culture are also affected by a set of animistic beliefs and assumptions that govern the choice of site; time and season for building; rituals to be observed before and during the construction of the house, including the noting of certain signs or omens that may affect the progress or abandonment of the work; the orientation of the house as well as the distribution of interior spaces; and other beliefs and practices that assure good health, a prosperous and happy family life, as well as protection from evil spirits of both the occupants and the builders of the house. Many local beliefs are found in the rest of insular Southeast Asia, where traditionally the dwelling is considered as animated and its construction governed by ritual to pacify spirits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The indigenous house is of modest proportions as it is used essentially as a shelter from the elements and as a place to cook, eat, and sleep. Most of the time its occupants stay outside&mdash;working under the extended eaves of the house or out in the fields. At other times, the house doubles as a social and cultural center. It becomes the setting for weddings, wakes, death anniversaries, religious rites, and other life-cycle celebrations. On such occasions, ritual platforms may be constructed beside or near the house, or on some parts of the house such as the porch. The whole house itself may be used by simply adjusting areas to allow for more space and a more appropriate setting for the rituals. Among Muslim Filipinos, a separate place for worship is provided in the form of mosques and smaller chapels. The mosque is part of a complex that includes a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">school</a>, a social hall, a library, and a conference room, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four considerations that may be used in classifying indigenous architecture. First, according to structure: cave dwellings, lean-tos, elevated one-room huts over land or water, multilevel houses, longhouses for the community, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/248\">tree houses</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/228\">houseboats</a>, and land houses. Second, according to use or function: places of worship, such as the prehispanic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>simbahan</strong></a> (church), a temporary structure built only as the need arises; the masjid (mosque) and the <strong>langgal</strong> or <strong>ranggar</strong> (small chapel); as well as dwellings and palisades or fortresses. Third is according to historical period: the ancient and prehispanic, pre-Islamic, Islamic, Spanish, American, modern, and contemporary. Finally, according to cultural groups: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, and other peoples of the Cordilleras; the various <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> groups such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2328\">Agta</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2368\">Pinatubo Aeta</a>, and the Dumagat; the various <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a> groups in Mindoro, notably the Hanunoo and the Alangan; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanua</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2333\">Batak</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a> peoples from Palawan; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a>, the Tagbanua, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> from the Mindanao-Sulu-Palawan area. In this discussion, the first three considerations, i.e., structure, functions, and historical periods, will be merged in a general survey of all the types of structures found in the islands through history. The fourth consideration will be covered in detail by the essays on the different peoples of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"typesofstructure\" name=\"typesofstructure\"></a>Types of Structure in History</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architecture, like other art forms, is a product of history. Indigenous architecture has evolved in response to changes in time and history, so that although it is the repository of traditional skills and lore and remains a vital link to the past, it has allowed change and innovation over the years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in other parts of the world, cave dwellings were perhaps the earliest shelters in the Philippines. Evidence that early peoples of the Philippines used caves as habitations is found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/386\">Tabon caves</a> of Palawan. The cave was the most natural habitat for people whose survival depended on food gathering and hunting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next stage in the evolution of indigenous architecture was marked by the appearance of the lean-to, the first attempt at building. With just a few branches and twigs, and some leaves and fronds as sidings, early Filipinos constructed a wind-sun-and-rain screen supported by a pole at an angle on the ground. This suited the lifestyle of nomadic groups such as the Aeta. The present-day descendants of these groups&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2328\">Agta</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a>, Baluga, Dumagat, Ita or Ati&mdash;are no longer as nomadic as their ancestors, but in earlier times, they would travel from place to place in search of food and sustenance bringing with them their life-symbol, the lean-to, ready to be put up anytime as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, the practice of&nbsp;<em>kaingin&nbsp;</em>or swidden farming gave rise to a more settled life in a real house. However, durability was not a major concern because swidden farmers knew that when the land&rsquo;s productivity reached a low ebb, they had to move to another site. Many ethnic groups still practice swidden cultivation, and it can only be inferred that their houses now resemble those of the original kaingin farmers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction of wet-rice agriculture brought about a truly settled life and a need for a more permanent dwelling. The houses then were probably similar in structure to present-day <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\">indigenous houses</a>: a single-room house cage elevated on posts or stilts, with steep thatched roofs, slatted flooring and sidings made of bamboo or hardwood; they were cool and airy, well ventilated, and free from dampness and humidity. It may be concluded that the basic features then of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut), the dwelling of the lowland Christianized populace, had already been established even before the Spaniards came.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early Filipino communities, mainly coastal and riverine, were isolated groups of dwellings consisting of 3 to 30 houses. In large compact trading communities, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a> and Manila, a few thousand people lived in clustered villages (Fox 1977, 355). In general, bigger and sturdier houses prevailed in nucleated villages, while smaller and less permanent types predominated in those areas close to the fields or kaingin sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of different environments, upland and lowland houses developed interesting contrasts. Lowland structures tended to have a more open, airy interior, while upland ones were tightly enclosed with solid planks, having few or no windows because of the chilly mountain weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Special types of houses developed in various parts of the Philippines. In fishing communities in the Sulu archipelago, houses were built over water for hundreds of years for practical reasons. In places where violent intercommunity clashes occurred, tree houses were built by such groups as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> (Ilongot) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a> of northern Luzon, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a> and Bukidnon of eastern Mindanao. And in areas regularly ravaged by typhoons such as Batanes, sturdy, firmly fastened, lime-and-stone-walled dwellings with a meter-thick grass roof protected their inhabitants from strong rains and winds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each house provided not only effective protection from the elements but also functioned, whenever needed, as a &ldquo;temple&rdquo; or &ldquo;church&rdquo; or sociocultural center. Except for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\"><strong>kuta</strong></a> or palisades and fortifications, no other structures had specialized functions. Sometime during the 14th century, Islam was introduced in Sulu. Being an organized religion, it required a permanent and separate place of worship. The tradition of the mosque began.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two types of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/234\">mosques</a> developed in the Philippines: the <strong>masjid</strong> and the smaller <strong>ranggar</strong> (Maranao) or <strong>langgal</strong> (Tausug and Yakan). The masjid, the traditional Islamic mosque, is the &ldquo;larger and more permanent structure, built on a stone foundation, often near a stream or a body of water&rdquo; (Gowing 1979, 60). The Friday noon assembly prayers, with the obligatory&nbsp;<em>khutbah&nbsp;</em>or sermon, and&nbsp;<em>Id&nbsp;</em>observances, may be held only in the masjid. The ranggar or langgal is a hamlet &ldquo;chapel,&rdquo; a small &ldquo;semipermanent structure built for the convenience of the faithful who live far from a masjid&rdquo; (Gowing 1979, 60).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> of Basilan Island, the langgal functions generally in the same way as the masjid, so that even Friday noon assembly prayers may be held here. An interesting point about the langgal is that, like the typical Yakan dwelling, it is built on piles too and is conceived on indigenous lines. It is similar to Southeast Asian mosques, notably the Indonesian Javanese <strong>langgar</strong> and the Malaysian <strong>surau</strong>, both of which contain a &ldquo; <strong>voorgalerij</strong> or porch with a separate roof and a large room with a niche (<strong>pangimbaran</strong>)&rdquo; (Wulff 1981, 113-27), standard features of a regular mosque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic difference between the langgal and the typical Yakan dwelling is that in the langgal, the &ldquo;side walls do not reach right up to the roof&rdquo; (Wulff 1981, 20). The entrance to this house of prayer is through the porch, which is a step lower than the main room and usually covered, with a roof that is somewhat lower than the main roof. At the opposite end wall is the <strong>sunting</strong> or niche that faces west. During services this part of the langgal is covered with cloth but normally devoid of any decor, like the langgal itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The masjid was originally a three-tiered bamboo or wooden structure similar to a Chinese or Japanese pagoda or Balinese temple, a pattern that is also widespread in Indonesia and the Malay Peninsula. Developed later was a second style, the more familiar onion-shaped dome on squinches set over a square or rectangular hall that is more common in the Middle East. Perhaps this style evolved from the accumulated experience of seeing Middle East mosques in the course of Mecca pilgrimages. While the pagoda-type masjid is older than the domed one, the langgal is even older than either one and antedates the former by several centuries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tubig-Indangan Mosque in Simunul Island in Tawi-Tawi is perhaps the oldest standing mosque in the Philippines. This mosque is said to be the work of the celebrated Muslim figure Makhdum Karim, who pioneered in the Islamization of Sulu around the last quarter of the 14th century. The Tubig-Indangan mosque is a prototype of the old-style mosque with its graceful two-tiered pagoda-like structure set over a rectangular space and topped by a finial carrying the symbols of Islam: the crescent moon and the star. A typical mosque, it has a <strong>mihrab</strong> or niche with a small dome over it and inside has a wooden screen separating the men from the women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other mosques done in the old-style pagoda design may be found in Balo-i, Lanao del Norte and in the old Muslim communities in the Ramain area east of Lake Lanao, especially in Taraka. All later mosques feature the onion-shaped dome and fancy minarets, evidently of Persian influence. Arabic geometric ornamental designs as well as large Quranic inscriptions have become more common and have replaced in some places in Mindanao the traditional <strong>okir</strong> designs, the colorful patterns beautifully carved on the <strong>mimbars</strong> or wooden pulpits, and other parts of old mosques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of the mosque is a carpeted square or rectangular hall that can accommodate at least 40 people, or 44 as in the case of Sulu at any given time. The worshippers face Mecca in congregational prayers by turning towards the <strong>quibla</strong> (wall), in the direction of the mihrab, the recessed area in the middle of the quibla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> &ldquo;great house,&rdquo; the <strong>torogan</strong> (datu&rsquo;s large house), is another important contribution to Philippine vernacular architecture. Earthquake-proof, solid, and durable, it is the Maranao ancestral house, residence of the datu or sultan of the leading kin group. Occasionally it is used as the setting for big weddings, wakes, and other socio-religious gatherings. Its elevated position among the other houses is immediately apparent in the exuberant wavelike patterns of colorful and intricate okir carvings on the protruding beam-ends of the house, making the torogan appear like a floating, sculptural mass. It looms huge and stately with its high, salakot-like roof that flares at the sides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Melvin Mednich (Lebar 1975, 37), if the mosque is the politically defining feature of a Maranao hamlet, the torogan is its socially defining feature. Such is the importance attached to this multifamily dwelling whose great size bespeaks rank, wealth, and prestige. Another important Muslim structure is the kuta, which, until the American colonial period, provided protection against enemy attacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the advent of Spanish rule in the Philippines, a dramatic restructuring of Philippine religious, socioeconomic, and political life occurred. New structures were built, reflecting the major preoccupations and values of Spanish colonial life. The most important of these were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, plazas, and houses of the&nbsp;<em>ilustrado&nbsp;</em>(educated) class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this period, houses signified the wealth and social rank of their owners. The typical lowland dwelling, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\">bahay kubo</a> became identified with the lower classes. The bigger houses made of more permanent materials like hardwood and stone became a symbol of affluence. These mansions were popularly called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> or stone house, <strong>bahay na tisa</strong> or house with roof tiles, or by a rather misleading name, <strong>bahay Kastila</strong> or Spanish house. Being the homes of the well-to-do, these wood-and-stone houses were largely concentrated in the&nbsp;<em>cabecera&nbsp;</em>or capital of the town or the&nbsp;<em>poblacion&nbsp;</em>or town proper. The smaller flimsy bahay kubo, the house of the poor, was found around the <strong>visita</strong> or mission chapel of the barrios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Christian indigenous house, the bahay kubo retained the features of the traditional house, such as the steep roof, elevated quarters, slatted flooring, and wide eaves, but added wide awning-type windows; the <strong>silid</strong>, where the occupants of the house could change clothes in private; the altar, for the villager&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">santos</a> and other holy images; benches, tables, and other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furnishings</a> required by the new hispanized manners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically the bahay kubo consists of a <strong>balkon</strong> (front porch) that opens to a multipurpose <strong>bulwagan</strong>, the main room of the house, on one side of which is the silid. This leads to the kitchen, and finally, to a roofless <strong>batalan</strong>, a back porch which serves as a cleaning or washing area or even as a bathroom. The house is usually entered through the front porch or through the batalan via a bamboo ladder. In some cases, however, the kitchen is moved to ground level or else built as a separate structure. Depending on the locale and the terrain and the prevailing climate and weather, choice of materials and elevation of the house may vary from place to place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bahay na bato was a bigger, sturdier, and more sophisticated version of the prehispanic bahay kubo, retaining the usual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">post-and-lintel</a> construction of the traditional dwelling. Some innovations, however, may be noted: a highly flexible interior where rooms may be joined or separated by opening or closing wide doors; the addition of an <strong>azotea</strong> or second-floor open-air terrace at the back of the house, and a <strong>caida</strong>, a foyer at the top of the stairs; the <strong>capiz</strong> or windowpane oysters, later protected by a metal awning or <strong>media-agua</strong>, a sun-and-rain-screen; the <strong>ventanillas</strong> or small windows between the window sills and the floorboards; the stone skirt on the ground floor which inspired the native name for the structure; and of course, the tiled roofs. All these give the bahay na bato a genteel and elegant look, without taking away the light and airy qualities of its bamboo-and-grass antecedent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous concepts persisted well into the American colonial period and were embodied notably in the suburban <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\"><strong>tsalet</strong></a> or chalet-type dwelling, a hallmark of middle-class living. One level but elevated, the tsalet is a simplified bahay na bato. In form and spirit, it is closer to the original bahay kubo in its return to simplicity and functionalism. Its most prominent feature is the front porch which, in many cases, extends to the sides of the house, creating what <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo Perez III</a> calls &ldquo;space surrounding space.&rdquo; Its entrance is through an L-shaped or T-shaped stairway either in concrete or wood or both. Like the bahay kubo, the tsalet conveys lightness, elegance, and warmth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The modern period gave way to American building concepts and technology. Skyscrapers made of steel-reinforced concrete and glass transformed the Philippine skyline. Amidst these symbols of American efficiency, bigness, and boldness, the original bahay kubo would reappear in the squatter shanties that sprouted in every conceivable manner on any available space&mdash;whether inland, coastal, or even along the esteros or urban estuaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some architects are now experimenting with bamboo not only as decoration but as structural component. Many contemporary houses are being designed to cope with the tropical weather and to revive certain psychological values inherent in the designs of the bahay kubo, such as that of social and family interaction. Many public buildings now sport the salakot-shaped roof or the okir motif of the torogan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, while many slum dwellers pattern their makeshift homes after the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\">bungalow</a>, the more popular American tropical residence, quite a number prefer the more practical bahay kubo design, utilizing GI sheets and scrap materials gathered from garbage dumps. Drawing from tradition, the better shanties along the coastal road leading to Las Pi&ntilde;as are one-room bamboo or wooden dwellings elevated on stilts. They convey an overall sense of lightness and roominess despite the cramped space and cheap materials. They also prove that, with creativity and ingenuity, dwellings may be fashioned out of recycled materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>The Indigenous Houses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous architecture is influenced chiefly by the lifeways, environment, and social organization of the different cultural communities. From Batanes in the extreme north down to the Tawi-Tawi Islands in the south, interesting forms emerge. In the north are the sturdy, lime-and-stone-walled dwellings of the Ivatan of Batanes; the flimsy lean-tos of the Agta of Palanan, Isabela; the twin houses of the Itawes of Cagayan Valley; the compact and cozy upland Cordillera houses. In central Philippines there is the communal Mangyan longhouse; and in southern Philippines, the Maranao torogan, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> <strong>gunu bong</strong> or big house, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> land house, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> <strong>bay sinug</strong>, and the Mandaya or Bukidnon version of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/248\">tree house</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most typical of northern indigenous houses is the mountain house of the Cordilleras. Using mostly the post-and-lintel method and following a very precise, fixed, and highly revered tradition of house building, the Cordillera house is an ingenious adaptation to the demands of mountain living. William Henry Scott noted two architectural styles in the Cordilleras, namely, the northern and the southern strains (Scott 1969).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The northern strain, which includes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a> (or Apayao) and northern <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, is characterized by a high, gabled roof formed by the combination of bowed rafters and tiered wallboards which fill in the gables; a rectangular floor space divided into three sections and two levels; and two separate sets of posts totally independent of one another, one set supporting the floor, the other, the roof. The southern strain, which comprises <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, Benguet, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, is marked by a steep hip or pyramidal or conical roof that rests on top of the walls of the house cage, the latter a space that serves either as the living area among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">lbaloy</a> or as a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">granary</a> among the Bontok and the Sagada. A set of four posts supporting two girders, which in turn support three beams or joists, carry the weight of the wooden box or cage that makes up the house proper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cordillera architecture, which includes huts, houses, and communal dormitories, shows an interesting relationship between building patterns and the Igorot lifestyle and environment. For the Igorot, a dwelling should provide adequate protection against humidity and dampness (since part of the house is also a granary, the grain has to be protected from mildew), the pervasive chilly mountain weather, as well as hostile tribes, predatory animals, and vermin. In addition, a good design must take into account the precipitous mountain terrain and the possibility of landslides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While most people of the Cordilleras practice swidden or slash-and-burn agriculture, some like the Ifugao, the Bontok, and the Kalinga engage in wet-terrace farming. Possibly an adaptation of lowland wet-rice agriculture to a mountainous terrain, these <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/241\">rice terraces</a> may be found in elevations of anywhere from 500 to 1,600 m. The walls reach up to 6 m, in some cases even up to 16 m. Traditionally considered as the artists of the Cordilleras, the Ifugao fashioned long, massive, sloping walls of stone and earth that followed the contour of the mountain sides, making the terraces look like an enormous piece of sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bontok terraces, on the other hand, run in straight lines with almost vertical stone faces. They seem designed to maximize the level area for planting. The terraces of Kalinga, in contrast to the Ifugao and the Bontok, have low stone walls supporting inward sloping earth walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the rice terraces, the high level of craftsmanship and technical ingenuity of Cordillera dwellings certainly comes as no surprise. Also, the design of these structures can be related with that of the different terraces. Compare, for example, the steep roof and strict, rigid nature of the Bontok <strong>fay-u</strong> with the towering Bontok terrace walls; the relatively low roofs and more open character of the Kalinga <strong>binayon</strong> or octagonal house with the low stone walls of their terraces; and the classical line and artistry of the Ifugao <strong>fale</strong> (house), as seen especially in Mayoyao, with the graceful, sculptural treatment of their terraces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ifugao, whose architectural style is typical of the southern strain, generally locate their houses and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">villages</a> on their ancestral lands, amid their rice terraces, along hillsides and valleys, near springs or groves. Usually built close to each other for mutual protection, there are usually 10 houses in a small village and up to as many as 40 or more in a big village. They are grouped organically rather than lineally, in interesting arrangements where house, terrace, and the surrounding vegetation blend harmoniously. Because of their high locations, these houses may only be approached by footpaths on terrace walls. There are no fences, for it is said that &ldquo;only houses whose owners have pigs have a fence (<strong>alad</strong>) around them&rdquo; (Lambrecht 1929, 117-41).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two types of Ifugao dwellings are the <strong>abong</strong> (hut), and the fale or <strong>bale</strong>. Huts are temporary in nature and simpler to build; houses are more permanent structures, taller and characterized by pyramidal roofs. The <strong>alang</strong> (granary house) is usually considered a house. The <strong>agamang</strong>, a sleeping dormitory for unmarried boys and girls above 10 years of age, is classified as a hut. The abong is home to the elderly, who have given their own houses to their married children or to poor people who cannot afford a house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ifugao fale looks like a giant mushroom. It is so organically related to its setting that it seems to be part of the earth, despite its 1.5 to 2-meter elevation. This is probably because of the low eaves and the heavy pyramidal roof that almost totally covers the planked walls of this one-room dwelling. The fale has three parts. The lower part, consists of the four <strong>tukud</strong> (foundation posts), with the characteristic cylindrical rat guards fitted towards the top of each post, and the two <strong>kuling</strong> (transverse girders), which rest on the posts. The middle or the house cage area starts from the three floor joists over which the floorboards are fitted and wallboards mortised all the way up to the loft above the upper frame of the cage. The upper part makes up the whole roof area. The house is therefore a three-tiered structure where the posts and girders support the house cage which in turn supports the roof. There are wooden doors in the front and the back of the house. A ladder, the access to the house, is either removed and lifted to safety at night, hung neatly on the wall, or placed under the house when the owner is away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior of the fale is dark and smoky, cozy, warm, and intimate because of the pale glow that filters into this windowless, womblike space. As it is just some 4 to 9 sqm in size, only the parents and the smallest children sleep here; the rest of the brood and the other adult members of the household move to the agamang or sleeping hall of the village at night. In this small space the family cooks, eats, sleeps, performs rituals, and celebrates for many generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built out of heavy, hand-hewn timber such as narra that interlock each other perfectly without the use of nails or hardware, this solid and durable house can be taken apart, moved, and raised anew on a new site all in one day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two indispensable features of the Ifugao house immediately establish the context and philosophy behind Ifugao and Cordillera architecture: namely, the fireplace and the rat guard. The fireplace warms and gives the characteristic black soot to the interior. The rat guard protects the grain, since the attic portion of the house also serves as a granary. The few shelves or racks in the house are mostly intended for the storage of firewood and grain. The granary is so central to Cordillera life and economy that the alang, its twin, is always built close to the fale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Ifugao use only the attic or a separate structure for the granary, other Cordillera groups integrate the granary into the house plan. This may be observed in the case of the Bontok fay-u and the Sagada <strong>innagamang</strong>. The Bontok and Sagada, unlike other peoples in the Cordillera, live and sleep on the ground floor. In the Bontok fay-u the elevated wooden chamber, which occupies one-half of the total floor area, functions as a granary. Furthermore, the roof structure allows for additional rice storage area in the attic, making the house virtually a three-story affair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bontok fay-u thus represents a further step in creating various uses for the ground floor area. By enclosing it completely with tightly fitting pine boards as <strong>ching-ching</strong> (walls), and by making the steep thatched roof extend downwards and flare outwards through the use of auxiliary rafters, it protects the working area under the house. More posts are used not only to support the extended roof but also to serve as nailing strips for the wooden <strong>ka-ew</strong> (planks) that enclose the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Sagada house, the <strong>agamang</strong> (granary), is made truly rat-proof by a gabled roof of solid planks mortised and rabbeted together. The innagamang is like the Bontok house, except that it is completely enclosed to keep out the cold. The wooden plank floor divides symmetrically into three levels: the sunken middle portion becomes the living area, while slightly raised platforms to the left and the right are used for sleeping and storage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other examples of the southern style include the Bauko house in the northern Kankanaey or Lepanto culture area, as well as the Bokod house among the Kankanaey and the Ibaloy, which includes the older <strong>dokbut</strong> with its walls of <strong>sawali</strong> (split-and-woven bamboo) walls, and the <strong>tinabda</strong> or <strong>tinabla</strong> (from Spanish &ldquo;tabla&rdquo;) or &ldquo;large wooden house,&rdquo; said to be a later style (Scott 1969).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bauko <strong>binangiyan</strong> has a steep roof built to such a height that what is a small attic in the Ifugao fale becomes an additional floor in the Bauko house. The addition of a small ridgepole parallel to the front provides two vents for easier elimination of smoke which rises to the roof and which, incidentally, prevents the roof from rotting and helps protect stored food and utensils from mildew. Also long planks laid down on the stone paving form a partial floor, making the house a three-story affair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>bokod</strong> house of the Ibaloy, on the other hand, solves the problem of restricted space by simply enlarging the elevated chamber itself. For this purpose, it uses longer and sturdier timber and more posts, sometimes totaling seven or even nine, to support the structure. Other features include a flaring roof and a small porch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical examples of the northern style are the Isneg <strong>binuron</strong>, &ldquo;big house,&rdquo; and <strong>alan</strong>, the sawali-walled granary; the Kalinga <strong>kulub</strong> (small house) in the northeastern foothills, as well as houses in the Mabaca Valley from the northern edge of Kalinga subprovince in the Apayao border into the lower Saltan River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The binuron&rsquo;s rafters are bowed into the shape of a Gothic arch. Its floor and roof are supported on a completely independent set of posts, and the floor has slightly raised platforms along both sides. Its rectangular floor plan contrasts with that of the square houses found on higher ground in the Cordilleras, like the Ifugao house, the Kankanaey, the Ibaloy, the Bontok, and the Sagada.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mabaca Valley houses are similar to the Isneg&rsquo;s, being elevated, elongated, and gabled. Across the front door, an annex or a lean-to is added and used as a kitchen. Such annexes or lean-tos, porches, and various covered areas in front and at the back of the house are a regular feature of northern houses. In Mabaca, the kitchen annex may duplicate in cross-section the house walls and roof, complete with its own underpinning&mdash;a significant innovation in northern houses since it almost totally eliminates the smoke from the stove, a distinct advantage over the southern houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the lower Saltan and the upper Mabaca valleys, the curved roof with bowed rafters may not always appear, but two invariable features are: the gabled front with its two tiers of vertical wallboards and upper triangular space loosely covered with bamboo lathing, and the distinctive floor, supported by a row of posts set inside the walls, independent of the roof-supporting posts. The floor is divided longitudinally into three sections running front to back and usually covered with a rolled matting of split rattan or reeds laid loosely on laths mortised into the floor joists. The betel nut-chewing occupants can simply roll back the floor covering to open up a space to spit the juice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, Kalinga houses show a three-fold longitudinal division of the floor, which is raised to chest level by posts independent from those supporting the roof and walls. But in the octagonal Kalinga house called binayon or <strong>finaryon</strong>, there is a combination of the northern three-division floor with the southern-type three-joists-on-two-girders-on-four-posts under-pinning. The octagonal form is achieved by extending all four sides of the square southern house and closing in with diagonal walls the areas in between.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mangyan of northern Oriental Mindoro build two types of houses: the single-room family house is common in the lowlands; and the communal house, probably the older of the two, now rarely seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>banwas</strong>, as the Mangyan community longhouses are called, are built either on top of or the side of a hill, on level ground, or on a plateau, just a few hundred meters away from the clearings. The preferred location for the house is the leeward side of mountains or hills, which offers protection against strong winds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical house measures about 6 m wide and 10 m long, with the door usually located on the narrower side. A three- or four-step ladder or a notched log leads to the small entrance. Occasionally, side doors or simply openings are added for easy access to the section allotted to the family. There are no partitions; mats, or occasionally, the bark of the lauan tree spread on the floor, serve to define the space for the different families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A steep roof of cogon grass, with the roof ridge extending 4 m or more in height, protects the house from strong rains. Since the walls are very low, only a meter or less from the floor, the projecting eaves give extra protection from the cold. Each family has its own fireplace, so that during cooking time, the absence of smoke holes makes the whole house &ldquo;seem to be on fire because smoke comes out from every conceivable direction&rdquo; (Maceda 1967, 114). During mealtime there is a frequent sharing of cooked food among the different families. Communal houses are generally about 1 km or more apart, depending on the terrain. The occupants of different houses communicate by shouting to one another as loudly as they could. They also announce the approach of strangers in this way. Proceeding farther south, the number of large houses for single families increases. But even the smaller houses give the feeling of expanse, of openness, more here than in the north.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example of a large house is the two-leveled Tboli <strong>gunu bong</strong> found in the Lake Sebu area of South Cotabato. Around 14 m long and 8-9 m wide, it looks bigger because it has no partitions. Divisions are suggested optically by means of levels and posts. The lower central space is thus integrated with the elevated side areas: the area of honor, the sleeping areas, and the vestibule. The great size of such houses is necessary because a typical Tboli household, like the Maranao&rsquo;s, consists of an extended family numbering anywhere between eight and sixteen people. Polygamy, practiced by those who can afford it, adds to the number of residents in a house. Three or four such houses form a cluster, which operates independently of other clusters. Situated along hilltops and rolling land, these houses express the harmony between man and nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gunu bong looks like a roof on stilts and gives the impression of &ldquo;hovering over&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;resting on&rdquo; the spot it occupies. This is so because the roof eaves extend about 1 m over the side walls, which are themselves just a little over 1 m high. Unlike northern houses, Tboli roofs are not very steep. The bamboo stilts rise 1 m above the ground. Tree stumps are also used as posts for the inner portion of the house and floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its dimensions the gunu bong is, to the Tboli, a &ldquo;tawny, mellow-weathered bamboo womb&rdquo; where he is nestled high and free, touched by the gentle glow and texture of bamboo and the decorative richness and color of the <strong>klabu</strong>, the cloth canopy that hangs over where he sleeps (Casal 1978, 62&ndash;4). Of the several varieties of houses in the southern Philippines, the house on stilts built over the water is the most romantic. It embodies the Tausug-Sama&rsquo;s closeness to the sea. While the northern groups in Luzon design their life and homes around the mountain, the people of the Sulu area keep up with the rhythm of the sea&mdash;the house on stilts along the shoreline; the land house built entirely over water; and the ever-familiar houseboat, which is both home and fishing boat to the Sama Dilaut (Badjao).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sama, who occupy most of the smaller coral islands of Sulu, build their houses on piles driven into the reef floor. These houses are connected to the shore and to one another by a labyrinth of walkways and bridges of timber and split bamboo. The elevation of the house depends on the maximum high-tide level in the area. This is necessary in order to accommodate the outrigger boats, which the Sama tie underneath the house when not in use. Being fisherfolk and coral or shell gatherers, they need easy access to the sea and their fishing grounds; thus their vintas are kept under their houses. After fishing, the Sama can easily enter the house from the boat. The typical dwelling is made of bamboo and nipa, coconut lumber and mangrove, nipa or sawali for the roof and walls, bamboo for the stairs and floors, coconut wood, mangrove or other tree trunks for the posts and other structural elements. Because the roof is low, the beams that support it are outside the walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design of the house is simple. It consists of a single room. Bigger types may have many small rectangular rooms. Sama houses always feature extensive, open porches or platforms called <strong>pantan</strong>, usually facing east. These serve as space for drying fish, woodworking, or preparing cassava; it is also the children&rsquo;s playground, a gathering place for families, or a place to hold rituals. A small house, built right along the porch or terrace, usually serves as a kitchen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional houses in the area are very large, the older ones 24 x 12 m and about 9 m high. The more recent ones are smaller, some only 4 x 6 m and 3 m high. It is said that older houses had two stories and balconies and were elaborately decorated with carvings. The reason for the large size is the extended family. It is not unusual to find as many as 4-6 people or anywhere from an average of 2 or 3 to a high of 15 nuclear families living together under one roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sama Dilaut, often called sea gypsies, are the nomads of the south, constantly roving across the channels of the Tawi-Tawi archipelago, or wherever fish and corals are abundant. They usually congregate and travel in groups in their houseboats, singing, clapping, and making noises along the way. The Sama Dilaut have three types of boats: the <strong>lepa</strong> or <strong>lipa</strong>, the <strong>jenging</strong>, and the <strong>dapang</strong>. The lepa, which has no outriggers, is the least stable but is equipped with sails for speed. The two other boats have outriggers. The dapang is much larger and can properly be called a houseboat. The cheapest is the jenging while the most expensive is the lepa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The well-built Sama Dilaut houseboat, with the characteristic outrigger, is equipped with a bench and a removable gable roof. The jenging is around 4 m long and 1 m high at the highest point, with just enough space to squat in and to store a few possessions, like a sail, a lamp for fishing, a water jar, a stove, pots and plates; a small chest, pillows and mats, and fishing spears. The floor is made of loose planks under which are kept various items and utensils and the catch of the day. An interesting feature of the Sama Dilaut houseboat is the ornate decorative carving based on the&nbsp;<em>okkil&nbsp;</em>motif on the walls and prows, stems, shafts, and in recent times, the gunwales, usually designed and executed by the boat builder, who most likely is the owner of the houseboat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the conversion of many Sama Dilaut to Islam, some groups ceased to be migratory boat dwellers, settling in so-called land houses situated near their fishing grounds. The term land house is actually misleading, since it is not built on land but entirely on water. Unlike the Sama house on stilts which is still connected to the shoreline by house-to-house bridges, the Sama Dilaut house has no connection to the shore. Many Sama Dilaut, however, still prefer to live in their small family boats, claiming that they get &ldquo;dizzy&rdquo; in the fixed land house, and feel safer on the boat. From birth to death, they live almost exclusively on the boat. They regard the land house or other shore dwellings as temporary pile shacks. Here they could easily get sick after a mere two hours&rsquo; stay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite their free, roving existence, there is a strong sense of camaraderie and kinship among the Sama Dilaut. On certain occasions, such as weddings and funerals, communities of from 50 to 200 families may come together for the performance of certain rituals, each in their own family boat. Regrettably, this life-symbol of the Sama Dilaut &ldquo;dies&rdquo; with the death of the head of the family, for the boat is ceremonially broken up and made into a coffin to be buried with him, along with his fishnets, fish spear, and oars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although mistaken by foreigners to be the typical Filipino house at the turn of the century, the tree house has always been a rare sight. It is found only in a few parts of northern Luzon and in some areas in eastern Mindanao, notably among the Manobo of Agusan and the Mandaya of Davao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mandaya tree house is of two types. The first rests &ldquo;on the limbs of trees, conforming in size and shape to the nature of the supporting branches&rdquo; (Cole 1913, 182); the second is built on the trunk of a tree whose top has been cut off above the ground. Smaller poles are added to support the floor and extend upward to form the wall and the roof. Some houses of the first type have vertical sides and sloping roofs; in most cases, however, the roofs slope directly from a central ridgepole to the edges of the platform, making sidewalls unnecessary. Either type of house is entered by means of bamboo or rattan ladders, which are drawn up at night to prevent unwelcome entry and surprise attacks by hostile groups. The tree house is often located on the edge of cliffs and can be approached from only one direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"challenges\" name=\"challenges\"></a>Challenges and Transformations of the Indigenous Traditions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional indigenous structures have been characterized by the ability to adapt to the environment. Environment is increasingly understood as encompassing not just the natural environment but also the human environment, created by economic, social, and cultural forces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of the indigenous tradition is flux. Some, who tend to equate tradition with visible objects or tangible heritage and who prize what is uniquely native, decry that traditional dwellings are slowly disappearing or are being changed. In the northern Cordilleras, some Ifugao dwellings have been repaired by replacing the cogon grass roof with galvanized iron sheets. Although the form hip roof with an acute pitch is maintained, the loss of the cogon roof has changed the character of the dwelling. In the south, it is difficult to find examples of the langgal; what has replaced them are mosques of reinforced concrete, galvanized sheets but in the Middle Eastern style, characterized by onion dome on the main building and the minarets. The wooden drums that used to hang in the langgal where they were once used to summon people to worship are now antique pieces collected and used as interior decoration in modern buildings. Even the bahay kubo is being replaced by modern structures financed by the remittances of overseas workers. Some reinforced concrete and galvanized iron-roof structures are outright transplants from the countries where an overseas worker has worked and continues to work. Thus, houses like the type of Greek dwellings found on Santorini Island, Italian-style villas, and steep-roofed Swiss chalets are being built in places which will not see snow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many reasons for the erosion of traditional indigenous dwellings. These are environmental, economic, and social. As the environment degrades indigenous structures made of natural materials like hardwood, nipa and anahaw palm, grass, bamboo, and reeds, the houses become difficult to repair because these materials are getting scarce. The tropical forests, the source of hardwood, continue to be exploited, despite laws controlling or outright banning of lumber extraction. Communities that have planted and maintained traditional forests as part of the landscape encounter problems when extracting lumber because government laws will not allow it. Swamps are being reclaimed for agriculture or for housing so the swamp-growing nipa palm has less and less space in which to grow. As natural materials become less available, their cost increases beyond the reach of the ethnic communities and the village folk who need them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous architecture is embedded in a culture. Because population growth can no longer sustain traditional means of livelihood, there is a steady migration of the younger population out of ancestral domains. For instance, the rice terraces in the Central Cordillera face a huge economic challenge. As a family increases in number because of births and the longer lifespan of a previous generation, there is little rice land to divide among the heirs. Usually the oldest sibling inherits the property and the other siblings leave. There is the allure of the city for economic and social advancement. More and more are leaving villages for a better life to these urban centers or even abroad. The result is that the indigenous culture and the skills necessary for building are not being transmitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic betterment has in some cases catalyzed the disappearance of indigenous architecture. Many bahay kubo in the Visayas are disappearing as foreign remittances allow family and relatives who remain on the islands to build in reinforced concrete and galvanized iron sheet roofing. The finely woven&nbsp;<em>amacan&nbsp;</em>or sawali walls characteristic of the Visayan bahay kubo are getting difficult to source. Unless they are outright copies of foreign models, these houses can still preserve characteristics of the indigenous tradition, especially if those who live in these new houses participate in the process of planning and construction. In some instances, however, the houses are copied from imported glossy magazines or from pictures sent by an overseas worker who is paying for the construction of the house in the home village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Efforts to save the indigenous tradition has resulted in the passage of &ldquo;The Indigenous Peoples Rights Act of 1997&rdquo; (RA no. 8371, passed into law on 25 Oct by the 10th Congress). Chapter VI (Sec 29) &ldquo;Cultural Identity&rdquo; recognizes the importance of protecting indigenous culture, traditions and institutions (chanrobles.com).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have emerged two trends in response to the perceived threat to the continuity of the indigenous tradition. One approach, which is object-oriented, may be characterized as making indigenous dwellings and villages museum pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notable is the Bontoc Village Museum established by the ICM sister Mother Basil Gekiere who was a missionary in Bontoc for 56 years. Outside the museum&rsquo;s main building is a replica of a Bontok village as a way of preserving ethnic architecture. A better known example is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3791\">Tam-awan Village</a> in Baguio City run by the Chanum Foundation Inc., established in 1998. In Tam-awan in Pinsao Proper, Baguio City, there is an effort &ldquo;to reconstruct Ifugao houses in Baguio with the view of making a model village accessible to people who do not have the chance to travel to the Cordillera interior.&rdquo; Starting with three dwellings transported from Bangaan, Ifugao, the village has added four more Ifugao houses and two Kalinga (Tam-awan).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of grouping, transporting, or rebuilding in a protected site traditional indigenous dwellings is not entirely new nor is it limited to the Philippines. At the end of World War II, the&nbsp;<em>machiya&nbsp;</em>or shop houses in Tokyo that survived the firebombing were transferred outside the city to the outdoor Tokyo Museum. In the United States, colonial Williamsburg in Virginia has been created to showcase life in colonial America. The Egyptian temple of Dendur is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and a Chinese scholar&rsquo;s residence in the Asian collection of the Peabody Museum at Salem, Massachusetts. While the act of transporting a building away from its original context is assailed by some heritage conservationists who prefer to preserve a structure on site, others support such transfers as the next best thing, since the threatened environment does not allow for the original structure to remain untouched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variation of the museum approach was the establishment of Nayong Filipino, near the Manila International Airport (NAIA 1) under the sponsorship of Imelda R. Marcos as First Lady. The concept was to recreate replica of Philippine houses, three-fourths their original size and cluster them according to regions. While these houses were not antique structures but were built for the project, they housed antique furnishings. Nayong Filipino was envisioned to be a one-stop place for a tourist who had no time to see the whole Philippines. It was placed near the international airport so that tourists who had some time to spare would spend their time at the Nayon while waiting for their flights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the first approach, the second approach recognizes that the indigenous tradition is dynamic, for that matter, all of architecture is dynamic. Sound architecture responds to the environment, so that even recognized heritage structures have a history of repair, remodeling, and upgrading to meet contemporary standards of safety, accessibility, and durability. The indigenous tradition has emphasized the harmony of structures with the natural environment so that the structure takes advantage of light and air, while providing protection against inclement weather, excessive heat and cold. The second approach is adaptive and developmental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architects have drawn structures that incorporate indigenous design and objects, like the raised floor and the hip roof. A pioneer in this effort was the work of the Bureau of Public Works of the American period which produced plans for the Mountain Province and Mindanao&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moro Province&rdquo; (Lanao, Cotabato, Basilan, and Sulu) which adapted features of the architecture of the region. In the post-World War II era, some regional and town museums have adopted the lines and decorative schemes of the area. An example is the main building of the Bontoc Village Museum, located within the compound of the ICM sisters&rsquo; convent and the St. Vincent Elementary School. It draws from the lines of Cordillera architecture and uses the steep hip roof. Built in the 1960s, Sulu Hotel in Quezon City was inspired by the Maranao torogan with its decorated okir beam projecting outward from the apex of the pitched roof. National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a> designed the Chapel of the Monastery of the Transfiguration in Malaybalay, Bukidnon following the hip roof of the Ifugao dwelling. Designed for the Benedictines, the chapel fits the mountainous region of Bukidnon and echoes the surrounding mountain peaks just as the Ifugao dwelling does. Architects like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2673\">Ma&ntilde;osas</a> have deliberately worked with indigenous designs, and drawing inspiration from the bahay kubo, as documented in <strong><em>Beyond the <strong><strong>Bahay Kubo</strong></strong></em></strong> (Caruncho 2012). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2655\">Rosario Encarnacion</a>, who espouses the use of bamboo, has adapted this material to urban residences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architectural projects of these Metro Manila-based architects are more often than not for urban-based clients. What then of the existing indigenous communities? Some indigenous people, who have been educated in a municipality&rsquo;s poblacion or in the cities return to their villages with advanced degrees, introduce modern conveniences like toilets, showers, and piped in water, insisting that the indigenous communities not be boxed in as exotica for the view of the tourist trade but, as full citizens of the Philippines, be entitled to what they perceive to be improvements in their lives. This approach to the indigenous tradition recognizes the dynamism of architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether up on a tree, high above the water, or close to the ground, the indigenous house has lived on. Through the centuries, it has gone through numerous adaptations, brought on by history and necessity. But its underlying philosophy&mdash;symbiosis with the environment and sensitivity to the needs of its dwellers and the larger community&mdash;has endured in its essential form, and has much to contribute in our present search for architecture that will express the Filipino.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

The favorite material, as in the rest of Southeast Asia, is bamboo which is used for posts, flooring, siding, roofing, and many others. Also used are coconut wood,&#xA0;<em>bakawan&#xA0;</em>or mangrove, some hardwoods, pinewood, and stones for the structure; cogon grass, coco and nipa palm, and banana bark for the roof coverings and wall sidings; rattan and other vines for fastening."

Territorial spaces are suggested by symbols, never stated with fences or walls; these are respected by the passersby and other residents in the area. For example, one does not litter within a certain space, nor allow one&#x2019;s cows or carabaos to stray into the area. One avoids passing near a neighbor&#x2019;s window where someone may be sleeping.

				"value": "The indigenous house is of modest proportions as it is used essentially as a shelter from the elements and as a place to cook, eat, and sleep. Most of the time its occupants stay outside&#x2014;working under the extended eaves of the house or out in the fields. At other times, the house doubles as a social and cultural center. It becomes the setting for weddings, wakes, death anniversaries, religious rites, and other life-cycle celebrations. On such occasions, ritual platforms may be constructed beside or near the house, or on some parts of the house such as the porch. The whole house itself may be used by simply adjusting areas to allow for more space and a more appropriate setting for the rituals. Among Muslim Filipinos, a separate place for worship is provided in the form of mosques and smaller chapels. The mosque is part of a complex that includes a <a href=\"/2/5/225\">school</a>, a social hall, a library, and a conference room, among others."

Second, according to use or function: places of worship, such as the prehispanic <a href=\"/2/5/244\"><strong>simbahan</strong></a> (church), a temporary structure built only as the need arises; the masjid (mosque) and the <strong>langgal</strong> or <strong>ranggar</strong> (small chapel); as well as dwellings and palisades or fortresses. Third is according to historical period: the ancient and prehispanic, pre-Islamic, Islamic, Spanish, American, modern, and contemporary. Finally, according to cultural groups: the <a href=\"/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, and other peoples of the Cordilleras; the various <a href=\"/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> groups such as the <a href=\"/1/2/2328\">Agta</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2368\">Pinatubo Aeta</a>, and the Dumagat; the various <a href=\"/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a> groups in Mindoro, notably the Hanunoo and the Alangan; the <a href=\"/1/2/2374\">Tagbanua</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2333\">Batak</a>, and <a href=\"/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a> peoples from Palawan; the <a href=\"/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2370\">Sama</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a>, the Tagbanua, the <a href=\"/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, and the <a href=\"/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> from the Mindanao-Sulu-Palawan area. In this discussion, the first three considerations, i.e., structure, functions, and historical periods, will be merged in a general survey of all the types of structures found in the islands through history. The fourth consideration will be covered in detail by the essays on the different peoples of the Philippines."

The masjid, the traditional Islamic mosque, is the &#x201C;larger and more permanent structure, built on a stone foundation, often near a stream or a body of water&#x201D; (Gowing 1979, 60). The Friday noon assembly prayers, with the obligatory&#xA0;<em>khutbah&#xA0;</em>or sermon, and&#xA0;<em>Id&#xA0;</em>observances, may be held only in the masjid.

An interesting point about the langgal is that, like the typical Yakan dwelling, it is built on piles too and is conceived on indigenous lines. It is similar to Southeast Asian mosques, notably the Indonesian Javanese <strong>langgar</strong> and the Malaysian <strong>surau</strong>, both of which contain a &#x201C; <strong>voorgalerij</strong> or porch with a separate roof and a large room with a niche (<strong>pangimbaran</strong>)&#x201D; (Wulff 1981, 113-27), standard features of a regular mosque."

The entrance to this house of prayer is through the porch, which is a step lower than the main room and usually covered, with a roof that is somewhat lower than the main roof. At the opposite end wall is the <strong>sunting</strong> or niche that faces west. During services this part of the langgal is covered with cloth but normally devoid of any decor, like the langgal itself."

Developed later was a second style, the more familiar onion-shaped dome on squinches set over a square or rectangular hall that is more common in the Middle East. Perhaps this style evolved from the accumulated experience of seeing Middle East mosques in the course of Mecca pilgrimages. While the pagoda-type masjid is older than the domed one, the langgal is even older than either one and antedates the former by several centuries."

This mosque is said to be the work of the celebrated Muslim figure Makhdum Karim, who pioneered in the Islamization of Sulu around the last quarter of the 14th century. The Tubig-Indangan mosque is a prototype of the old-style mosque with its graceful two-tiered pagoda-like structure set over a rectangular space and topped by a finial carrying the symbols of Islam: the crescent moon and the star. A typical mosque, it has a <strong>mihrab</strong> or niche with a small dome over it and inside has a wooden screen separating the men from the women."

All later mosques feature the onion-shaped dome and fancy minarets, evidently of Persian influence. Arabic geometric ornamental designs as well as large Quranic inscriptions have become more common and have replaced in some places in Mindanao the traditional <strong>okir</strong> designs, the colorful patterns beautifully carved on the <strong>mimbars</strong> or wooden pulpits, and other parts of old mosques."

Earthquake-proof, solid, and durable, it is the Maranao ancestral house, residence of the datu or sultan of the leading kin group. Occasionally it is used as the setting for big weddings, wakes, and other socio-religious gatherings. Its elevated position among the other houses is immediately apparent in the exuberant wavelike patterns of colorful and intricate okir carvings on the protruding beam-ends of the house, making the torogan appear like a floating, sculptural mass. It looms huge and stately with its high, salakot-like roof that flares at the sides."

Another important Muslim structure is the kuta, which, until the American colonial period, provided protection against enemy attacks."

The typical lowland dwelling, the <a href=\"/2/5/219\">bahay kubo</a> became identified with the lower classes. The bigger houses made of more permanent materials like hardwood and stone became a symbol of affluence. These mansions were popularly called <a href=\"/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> or stone house, <strong>bahay na tisa</strong> or house with roof tiles, or by a rather misleading name, <strong>bahay Kastila</strong> or Spanish house. Being the homes of the well-to-do, these wood-and-stone houses were largely concentrated in the&#xA0;<em>cabecera&#xA0;</em>or capital of the town or the&#xA0;<em>poblacion&#xA0;</em>or town proper. The smaller flimsy bahay kubo, the house of the poor, was found around the <strong>visita</strong> or mission chapel of the barrios."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "As the Christian indigenous house, the bahay kubo retained the features of the traditional house, such as the steep roof, elevated quarters, slatted flooring, and wide eaves, but added wide awning-type windows; the <strong>silid</strong>, where the occupants of the house could change clothes in private; the altar, for the villager&#x2019;s <a href=\"/3/15/2116\">santos</a> and other holy images; benches, tables, and other <a href=\"/3/15/2102\">furnishings</a> required by the new hispanized manners."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Basically the bahay kubo consists of a <strong>balkon</strong> (front porch) that opens to a multipurpose <strong>bulwagan</strong>, the main room of the house, on one side of which is the silid. This leads to the kitchen, and finally, to a roofless <strong>batalan</strong>, a back porch which serves as a cleaning or washing area or even as a bathroom. The house is usually entered through the front porch or through the batalan via a bamboo ladder. In some cases, however, the kitchen is moved to ground level or else built as a separate structure. Depending on the locale and the terrain and the prevailing climate and weather, choice of materials and elevation of the house may vary from place to place."

				"value": "The bahay na bato was a bigger, sturdier, and more sophisticated version of the prehispanic bahay kubo, retaining the usual <a href=\"/2/6/253\">post-and-lintel</a> construction of the traditional dwelling. Some innovations, however, may be noted: a highly flexible interior where rooms may be joined or separated by opening or closing wide doors; the addition of an <strong>azotea</strong> or second-floor open-air terrace at the back of the house, and a <strong>caida</strong>, a foyer at the top of the stairs; the <strong>capiz</strong> or windowpane oysters, later protected by a metal awning or <strong>media-agua</strong>, a sun-and-rain-screen; the <strong>ventanillas</strong> or small windows between the window sills and the floorboards; the stone skirt on the ground floor which inspired the native name for the structure; and of course, the tiled roofs. All these give the bahay na bato a genteel and elegant look, without taking away the light and airy qualities of its bamboo-and-grass antecedent."

				"value": "Indigenous concepts persisted well into the American colonial period and were embodied notably in the suburban <a href=\"/2/5/250\"><strong>tsalet</strong></a> or chalet-type dwelling, a hallmark of middle-class living. One level but elevated, the tsalet is a simplified bahay na bato. In form and spirit, it is closer to the original bahay kubo in its return to simplicity and functionalism. Its most prominent feature is the front porch which, in many cases, extends to the sides of the house, creating what <a href=\"/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo Perez III</a> calls &#x201C;space surrounding space.&#x201D; Its entrance is through an L-shaped or T-shaped stairway either in concrete or wood or both. Like the bahay kubo, the tsalet conveys lightness, elegance, and warmth."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The modern period gave way to American building concepts and technology. Skyscrapers made of steel-reinforced concrete and glass transformed the Philippine skyline. Amidst these symbols of American efficiency, bigness, and boldness, the original bahay kubo would reappear in the squatter shanties that sprouted in every conceivable manner on any available space&#x2014;whether inland, coastal, or even along the esteros or urban estuaries."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Some architects are now experimenting with bamboo not only as decoration but as structural component. Many contemporary houses are being designed to cope with the tropical weather and to revive certain psychological values inherent in the designs of the bahay kubo, such as that of social and family interaction. Many public buildings now sport the salakot-shaped roof or the okir motif of the torogan."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Interestingly, while many slum dwellers pattern their makeshift homes after the <a href=\"/2/5/222\">bungalow</a>, the more popular American tropical residence, quite a number prefer the more practical bahay kubo design, utilizing GI sheets and scrap materials gathered from garbage dumps. Drawing from tradition, the better shanties along the coastal road leading to Las Pi&#xF1;as are one-room bamboo or wooden dwellings elevated on stilts. They convey an overall sense of lightness and roominess despite the cramped space and cheap materials. They also prove that, with creativity and ingenuity, dwellings may be fashioned out of recycled materials."

Usually built close to each other for mutual protection, there are usually 10 houses in a small village and up to as many as 40 or more in a big village. They are grouped organically rather than lineally, in interesting arrangements where house, terrace, and the surrounding vegetation blend harmoniously. Because of their high locations, these houses may only be approached by footpaths on terrace walls. There are no fences, for it is said that &#x201C;only houses whose owners have pigs have a fence (<strong>alad</strong>) around them&#x201D; (Lambrecht 1929, 117-41)."

Huts are temporary in nature and simpler to build; houses are more permanent structures, taller and characterized by pyramidal roofs. The <strong>alang</strong> (granary house) is usually considered a house. The <strong>agamang</strong>, a sleeping dormitory for unmarried boys and girls above 10 years of age, is classified as a hut. The abong is home to the elderly, who have given their own houses to their married children or to poor people who cannot afford a house."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The Ifugao fale looks like a giant mushroom. It is so organically related to its setting that it seems to be part of the earth, despite its 1.5 to 2-meter elevation. This is probably because of the low eaves and the heavy pyramidal roof that almost totally covers the planked walls of this one-room dwelling. The fale has three parts. The lower part, consists of the four <strong>tukud</strong> (foundation posts), with the characteristic cylindrical rat guards fitted towards the top of each post, and the two <strong>kuling</strong> (transverse girders), which rest on the posts. The middle or the house cage area starts from the three floor joists over which the floorboards are fitted and wallboards mortised all the way up to the loft above the upper frame of the cage. The upper part makes up the whole roof area. The house is therefore a three-tiered structure where the posts and girders support the house cage which in turn supports the roof. There are wooden doors in the front and the back of the house. A ladder, the access to the house, is either removed and lifted to safety at night, hung neatly on the wall, or placed under the house when the owner is away."

As it is just some 4 to 9 sqm in size, only the parents and the smallest children sleep here; the rest of the brood and the other adult members of the household move to the agamang or sleeping hall of the village at night. In this small space the family cooks, eats, sleeps, performs rituals, and celebrates for many generations."

				"value": "Two indispensable features of the Ifugao house immediately establish the context and philosophy behind Ifugao and Cordillera architecture: namely, the fireplace and the rat guard. The fireplace warms and gives the characteristic black soot to the interior. The rat guard protects the grain, since the attic portion of the house also serves as a granary. The few shelves or racks in the house are mostly intended for the storage of firewood and grain. The granary is so central to Cordillera life and economy that the alang, its twin, is always built close to the fale."
			},

				"value": "While the Ifugao use only the attic or a separate structure for the granary, other Cordillera groups integrate the granary into the house plan. This may be observed in the case of the Bontok fay-u and the Sagada <strong>innagamang</strong>. The Bontok and Sagada, unlike other peoples in the Cordillera, live and sleep on the ground floor. In the Bontok fay-u the elevated wooden chamber, which occupies one-half of the total floor area, functions as a granary. Furthermore, the roof structure allows for additional rice storage area in the attic, making the house virtually a three-story affair."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The Bontok fay-u thus represents a further step in creating various uses for the ground floor area. By enclosing it completely with tightly fitting pine boards as <strong>ching-ching</strong> (walls), and by making the steep thatched roof extend downwards and flare outwards through the use of auxiliary rafters, it protects the working area under the house. More posts are used not only to support the extended roof but also to serve as nailing strips for the wooden <strong>ka-ew</strong> (planks) that enclose the area."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "In the Sagada house, the <strong>agamang</strong> (granary), is made truly rat-proof by a gabled roof of solid planks mortised and rabbeted together. The innagamang is like the Bontok house, except that it is completely enclosed to keep out the cold. The wooden plank floor divides symmetrically into three levels: the sunken middle portion becomes the living area, while slightly raised platforms to the left and the right are used for sleeping and storage."

The addition of a small ridgepole parallel to the front provides two vents for easier elimination of smoke which rises to the roof and which, incidentally, prevents the roof from rotting and helps protect stored food and utensils from mildew. Also long planks laid down on the stone paving form a partial floor, making the house a three-story affair."

Such annexes or lean-tos, porches, and various covered areas in front and at the back of the house are a regular feature of northern houses. In Mabaca, the kitchen annex may duplicate in cross-section the house walls and roof, complete with its own underpinning&#x2014;a significant innovation in northern houses since it almost totally eliminates the smoke from the stove, a distinct advantage over the southern houses."

The floor is divided longitudinally into three sections running front to back and usually covered with a rolled matting of split rattan or reeds laid loosely on laths mortised into the floor joists. The betel nut-chewing occupants can simply roll back the floor covering to open up a space to spit the juice."

The octagonal form is achieved by extending all four sides of the square southern house and closing in with diagonal walls the areas in between."

There are no partitions; mats, or occasionally, the bark of the lauan tree spread on the floor, serve to define the space for the different families."

				"value": "A steep roof of cogon grass, with the roof ridge extending 4 m or more in height, protects the house from strong rains. Since the walls are very low, only a meter or less from the floor, the projecting eaves give extra protection from the cold. Each family has its own fireplace, so that during cooking time, the absence of smoke holes makes the whole house &#x201C;seem to be on fire because smoke comes out from every conceivable direction&#x201D; (Maceda 1967, 114). During mealtime there is a frequent sharing of cooked food among the different families. Communal houses are generally about 1 km or more apart, depending on the terrain. The occupants of different houses communicate by shouting to one another as loudly as they could. They also announce the approach of strangers in this way. Proceeding farther south, the number of large houses for single families increases. But even the smaller houses give the feeling of expanse, of openness, more here than in the north."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "An example of a large house is the two-leveled Tboli <strong>gunu bong</strong> found in the Lake Sebu area of South Cotabato. Around 14 m long and 8-9 m wide, it looks bigger because it has no partitions. Divisions are suggested optically by means of levels and posts. The lower central space is thus integrated with the elevated side areas: the area of honor, the sleeping areas, and the vestibule. The great size of such houses is necessary because a typical Tboli household, like the Maranao&#x2019;s, consists of an extended family numbering anywhere between eight and sixteen people. Polygamy, practiced by those who can afford it, adds to the number of residents in a house. Three or four such houses form a cluster, which operates independently of other clusters. Situated along hilltops and rolling land, these houses express the harmony between man and nature."

This is so because the roof eaves extend about 1 m over the side walls, which are themselves just a little over 1 m high. Unlike northern houses, Tboli roofs are not very steep. The bamboo stilts rise 1 m above the ground. Tree stumps are also used as posts for the inner portion of the house and floor."

Of the several varieties of houses in the southern Philippines, the house on stilts built over the water is the most romantic. It embodies the Tausug-Sama&#x2019;s closeness to the sea. While the northern groups in Luzon design their life and homes around the mountain, the people of the Sulu area keep up with the rhythm of the sea&#x2014;the house on stilts along the shoreline; the land house built entirely over water; and the ever-familiar houseboat, which is both home and fishing boat to the Sama Dilaut (Badjao)."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The Sama, who occupy most of the smaller coral islands of Sulu, build their houses on piles driven into the reef floor. These houses are connected to the shore and to one another by a labyrinth of walkways and bridges of timber and split bamboo. The elevation of the house depends on the maximum high-tide level in the area. This is necessary in order to accommodate the outrigger boats, which the Sama tie underneath the house when not in use. Being fisherfolk and coral or shell gatherers, they need easy access to the sea and their fishing grounds; thus their vintas are kept under their houses. After fishing, the Sama can easily enter the house from the boat. The typical dwelling is made of bamboo and nipa, coconut lumber and mangrove, nipa or sawali for the roof and walls, bamboo for the stairs and floors, coconut wood, mangrove or other tree trunks for the posts and other structural elements. Because the roof is low, the beams that support it are outside the walls."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The design of the house is simple. It consists of a single room. Bigger types may have many small rectangular rooms. Sama houses always feature extensive, open porches or platforms called <strong>pantan</strong>, usually facing east. These serve as space for drying fish, woodworking, or preparing cassava; it is also the children&#x2019;s playground, a gathering place for families, or a place to hold rituals. A small house, built right along the porch or terrace, usually serves as a kitchen."

It is said that older houses had two stories and balconies and were elaborately decorated with carvings. The reason for the large size is the extended family. It is not unusual to find as many as 4-6 people or anywhere from an average of 2 or 3 to a high of 15 nuclear families living together under one roof."

They usually congregate and travel in groups in their houseboats, singing, clapping, and making noises along the way. The Sama Dilaut have three types of boats: the <strong>lepa</strong> or <strong>lipa</strong>, the <strong>jenging</strong>, and the <strong>dapang</strong>. The lepa, which has no outriggers, is the least stable but is equipped with sails for speed. The two other boats have outriggers. The dapang is much larger and can properly be called a houseboat. The cheapest is the jenging while the most expensive is the lepa."

The jenging is around 4 m long and 1 m high at the highest point, with just enough space to squat in and to store a few possessions, like a sail, a lamp for fishing, a water jar, a stove, pots and plates; a small chest, pillows and mats, and fishing spears. The floor is made of loose planks under which are kept various items and utensils and the catch of the day. An interesting feature of the Sama Dilaut houseboat is the ornate decorative carving based on the&#xA0;<em>okkil&#xA0;</em>motif on the walls and prows, stems, shafts, and in recent times, the gunwales, usually designed and executed by the boat builder, who most likely is the owner of the houseboat."

				"value": "With the conversion of many Sama Dilaut to Islam, some groups ceased to be migratory boat dwellers, settling in so-called land houses situated near their fishing grounds. The term land house is actually misleading, since it is not built on land but entirely on water. Unlike the Sama house on stilts which is still connected to the shoreline by house-to-house bridges, the Sama Dilaut house has no connection to the shore. Many Sama Dilaut, however, still prefer to live in their small family boats, claiming that they get &#x201C;dizzy&#x201D; in the fixed land house, and feel safer on the boat. From birth to death, they live almost exclusively on the boat. They regard the land house or other shore dwellings as temporary pile shacks. Here they could easily get sick after a mere two hours&#x2019; stay."

On certain occasions, such as weddings and funerals, communities of from 50 to 200 families may come together for the performance of certain rituals, each in their own family boat. Regrettably, this life-symbol of the Sama Dilaut &#x201C;dies&#x201D; with the death of the head of the family, for the boat is ceremonially broken up and made into a coffin to be buried with him, along with his fishnets, fish spear, and oars."

The first rests &#x201C;on the limbs of trees, conforming in size and shape to the nature of the supporting branches&#x201D; (Cole 1913, 182); the second is built on the trunk of a tree whose top has been cut off above the ground. Smaller poles are added to support the floor and extend upward to form the wall and the roof. Some houses of the first type have vertical sides and sloping roofs; in most cases, however, the roofs slope directly from a central ridgepole to the edges of the platform, making sidewalls unnecessary. Either type of house is entered by means of bamboo or rattan ladders, which are drawn up at night to prevent unwelcome entry and surprise attacks by hostile groups. The tree house is often located on the edge of cliffs and can be approached from only one direction."

Some, who tend to equate tradition with visible objects or tangible heritage and who prize what is uniquely native, decry that traditional dwellings are slowly disappearing or are being changed. In the northern Cordilleras, some Ifugao dwellings have been repaired by replacing the cogon grass roof with galvanized iron sheets. Although the form hip roof with an acute pitch is maintained, the loss of the cogon roof has changed the character of the dwelling. In the south, it is difficult to find examples of the langgal; what has replaced them are mosques of reinforced concrete, galvanized sheets but in the Middle Eastern style, characterized by onion dome on the main building and the minarets. The wooden drums that used to hang in the langgal where they were once used to summon people to worship are now antique pieces collected and used as interior decoration in modern buildings. Even the bahay kubo is being replaced by modern structures financed by the remittances of overseas workers. Some reinforced concrete and galvanized iron-roof structures are outright transplants from the countries where an overseas worker has worked and continues to work. Thus, houses like the type of Greek dwellings found on Santorini Island, Italian-style villas, and steep-roofed Swiss chalets are being built in places which will not see snow."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "There are many reasons for the erosion of traditional indigenous dwellings. These are environmental, economic, and social. As the environment degrades indigenous structures made of natural materials like hardwood, nipa and anahaw palm, grass, bamboo, and reeds, the houses become difficult to repair because these materials are getting scarce. The tropical forests, the source of hardwood, continue to be exploited, despite laws controlling or outright banning of lumber extraction. Communities that have planted and maintained traditional forests as part of the landscape encounter problems when extracting lumber because government laws will not allow it. Swamps are being reclaimed for agriculture or for housing so the swamp-growing nipa palm has less and less space in which to grow. As natural materials become less available, their cost increases beyond the reach of the ethnic communities and the village folk who need them."

Because population growth can no longer sustain traditional means of livelihood, there is a steady migration of the younger population out of ancestral domains. For instance, the rice terraces in the Central Cordillera face a huge economic challenge. As a family increases in number because of births and the longer lifespan of a previous generation, there is little rice land to divide among the heirs. Usually the oldest sibling inherits the property and the other siblings leave. There is the allure of the city for economic and social advancement. More and more are leaving villages for a better life to these urban centers or even abroad. The result is that the indigenous culture and the skills necessary for building are not being transmitted."

Many bahay kubo in the Visayas are disappearing as foreign remittances allow family and relatives who remain on the islands to build in reinforced concrete and galvanized iron sheet roofing. The finely woven&#xA0;<em>amacan&#xA0;</em>or sawali walls characteristic of the Visayan bahay kubo are getting difficult to source. Unless they are outright copies of foreign models, these houses can still preserve characteristics of the indigenous tradition, especially if those who live in these new houses participate in the process of planning and construction.

A better known example is <a href=\"/3/17/3791\">Tam-awan Village</a> in Baguio City run by the Chanum Foundation Inc., established in 1998. In Tam-awan in Pinsao Proper, Baguio City, there is an effort &#x201C;to reconstruct Ifugao houses in Baguio with the view of making a model village accessible to people who do not have the chance to travel to the Cordillera interior.&#x201D; Starting with three dwellings transported from Bangaan, Ifugao, the village has added four more Ifugao houses and two Kalinga (Tam-awan)."

In the United States, colonial Williamsburg in Virginia has been created to showcase life in colonial America. The Egyptian temple of Dendur is now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, and a Chinese scholar&#x2019;s residence in the Asian collection of the Peabody Museum at Salem, Massachusetts.

While these houses were not antique structures but were built for the project, they housed antique furnishings. Nayong Filipino was envisioned to be a one-stop place for a tourist who had no time to see the whole Philippines.

The indigenous tradition has emphasized the harmony of structures with the natural environment so that the structure takes advantage of light and air, while providing protection against inclement weather, excessive heat and cold. The second approach is adaptive and developmental."

In the post-World War II era, some regional and town museums have adopted the lines and decorative schemes of the area. An example is the main building of the Bontoc Village Museum, located within the compound of the ICM sisters&#x2019; convent and the St. Vincent Elementary School. It draws from the lines of Cordillera architecture and uses the steep hip roof. Built in the 1960s, Sulu Hotel in Quezon City was inspired by the Maranao torogan with its decorated okir beam projecting outward from the apex of the pitched roof. National Artist <a href=\"/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a> designed the Chapel of the Monastery of the Transfiguration in Malaybalay, Bukidnon following the hip roof of the Ifugao dwelling. Designed for the Benedictines, the chapel fits the mountainous region of Bukidnon and echoes the surrounding mountain peaks just as the Ifugao dwelling does.

This event brought the Philippines into the orbit of what evolved into the Spanish empire and exposed the islands to influences which may be called Hispanic rather than just Spanish. For these <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">influences</a> came from the many groups in Spain, including the Castillians, Basques, Galicians, Andalucians, and Portuguese (the latter were to form their own country in 1640). Included here as well were Islamic traditions merged with the Iberian under the name Mudejar. There were also close connections with the Flemish, Italians and Slavs, such as the Poles and Czechs. Counted among the Hispanic world of the Americas were the Mexicans, who called themselves Novohispanos, Peruvians, and several other nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architecture that developed within the 333-year period when the Philippines was formally a part of the Hispanic world is called Fil-Hispanic architecture. Its most iconic structures were: the <strong>iglesia</strong> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>simbahan</strong></a> (church) and its adjoining <strong>campanario</strong> (bell tower) and <strong>convento</strong>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\"><strong>escuela</strong></a> (school), the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\"><strong>fuerza</strong></a> or <strong>fortaleza</strong> (fortification), the civic building like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>tribunal</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/239\"><strong>farola</strong></a> (lighthouse), the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house), and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\"><strong>puente</strong></a> (stone bridge).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is generally acknowledged that the Philippines is the bastion of Christianity in the Orient. Some scholars believe that, because of this, the country absorbed the greatest degree of influence from the west in the Asian region, losing much of its identity in the process. Other scholars believe, however, that all these influences were really assimilated by the older ethnic base, which actually indigenized them. For example, the Spanish word for church, <strong>iglesia</strong>, never became fully accepted among the Filipinos, who used their own terms to denote a place of worship. Thus the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> use <strong>simbahan</strong>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <strong>simbaan</strong>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, <strong>pisamban</strong>. This process of indigenization was to characterize much of Filipino construction during the more than three centuries of Spanish colonization.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"beginnings\" name=\"beginnings\"></a>The Beginnings</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of Fil-Hispanic architecture under the Spanish regime begins with the arrival of Miguel Lopez de Legaspi&rsquo;s expedition in 1565. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a>, Legaspi&rsquo;s men founded a city, built a chapel, and erected a fort. The Spaniards then spent a short while in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/420\">Iloilo</a>, but because of promising reports they continued further north to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Manila</a>. In 1571 they took over the charred remains of the settlement of the city&rsquo;s previous native ruler Sulayman. Legaspi then traced the borders of the new Hispanic city on the strategic tongue of land at the mouth of the Pasig River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the beginnings of Hispanic Manila may already be discerned the patterns which were to characterize much of colonial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">town planning</a> throughout the country. Streets were built at right angles to each other, with the resulting layout appearing like a huge chessboard. There was a huge, open square, called the <strong>plaza</strong>, around which were situated the most important buildings of the city: the cathedral, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">governor general&rsquo;s palace</a>, the tribunal, and the city council. Secondary plazas were later constructed in different parts of the city. Since the city was located by the sea, an additional ordinance was followed: the main plaza was located close to the waterfront. For pueblos or towns located inland, the plaza was ordinarily placed in the center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the plaza evolved in Spain and other European countries during the Renaissance, it was in the Spanish colonies in America that the plaza complex was fully developed and exploited. The Philippines was, therefore, the recipient of much of the town-planning experience gained in the New World. The center of a church patio was marked by a large cross, which in early days was very well carved with flowers and foliage. The plaza became the heart of community life, and came to reflect the various traditions of the inhabitants. On festive occasions such as Easter, cockfights or bullfights were held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fusion of East and West in Philippine architecture was slowly effected through trial and error. The first buildings were of wood and bamboo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">materials</a> the Filipinos had been working expertly with since early times. Roofs were of nipa palm or cogon grass, and doubtless these primary constructions resembled the native residences. The Jesuit Ignacio Alzina, writing a century after the beginning of Spanish occupation, still encountered in the 1660s some of the first churches built in the Visayas. One had beams of ebony or <strong>mabolo</strong>. Some houses even dated to before the Spanish arrival. Alzina judged that, with the earthquakes, stone houses were not practical; wooden buildings were more adapted to the landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a fire destroyed wooden Manila in 1583, stone was considered a better building material. Quarries along the Pasig River provided building blocks, and kilns in Tondo, Morong, and San Mateo produced lime for a new construction surge in Manila. The Franciscans still used wood in rebuilding their church, but roofed it with clay tiles instead of thatch. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2700\">Fr Antonio Sede&ntilde;o</a> convinced Bp Salazar to have his residence built in stone, the first such construction in the islands. About 1585, the Jesuit also directed the building of the stone tower, Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, the first defense on the southern flank of Manila. Due to the inexperience of its builders, this tower had to be reinforced later with four large buttresses. The Augustinians began constructing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a>, their stone church and monastery, in 1586. This church, completed in 1604, has survived to this day, and thus merits being recognized as the oldest church building in the Philippines. It also featured that daring novelty: an arched vault over the nave of stone, which has amazingly survived to this day. By 1587 Gov-Gen Santiago de Vera (1584-89) required all buildings in Manila to be built of stone. Accordingly, the cathedral of Manila had walls of stone reaching 2 <strong>brazas</strong> (approximately 12 ft) by 1588; due to perennial lack of funds it was only finished in 1614.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gov-Gen Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as, who arrived in 1590, continued the impetus for stone masonry in Manila. Fr Sede&ntilde;o directed the building of the first Jesuit stone and brick church, dedicated to Santa Ana, in 1590. Like San Agustin, it featured a stone vault when it was completed in 1596. The Dominicans built their church of stone, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo</a>, from about 1590 to 1592. In 1591, Gov-Gen Dasmari&ntilde;as commenced the rebuilding of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> in stone, and connected it to the tower of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia with a solid masonry wall. This stone <strong>cortina</strong> protecting the seaside from erosion was extended all around the settlement, which gave rise to the walled city of Manila or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\"><strong>Intramuros</strong></a> (&ldquo;inside the walls&rdquo;). The Colegio de Santa Potenciana, a boarding school for orphan Spanish girls located behind San Agustin church, was built of stone in 1592-1594. The Franciscans finally decided to rebuild their mother church, dedicated to Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Angeles, in stone in 1602.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be sure, Manila was not the only scene of new construction in stone. Fr Gaspar de San Agustin, who published a history of the Augustinians in the Philippines in 1698, mentioned at least two instances outside the city walls. In Pasig, down by the river of the same name, Fr Diego de Moxica built a convento of stone before he died in 1584. In Malate, a district just south of Manila, a convento of &ldquo;good stone arches&rdquo; rose in the 1590s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus the last decade of the 16th and the first decades of the 17th century enclose what has been called the first golden age of building in stone. Glowing accounts of towering palaces and splendid mansions reached the Peninsula. However, the ambitious plans of the Spaniards were sorely tested when earthquakes succeeding one another in 1599 and 1600 and again in 1645 struck Manila. As one writer quipped, citizens were no longer roasted; they were crushed instead. The stone vault of the Jesuits&rsquo; Santa Ana collapsed in the earthquake of 1599. The Dominicans decided to build another church with foundations strong enough to support a stone vault to replace its roof of wood which caught fire in 1603. The work of ten years was ruined in the earthquake of 1645; what was left standing collapsed in another tremor in 1658.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The twin dangers of fire and earthquake gradually gave rise to another type of architecture. New edifices rarely rose to more than two floors, with the significant exception of churches. Stone walls expanded to as much as 3 m thick, and buildings started to sprout buttresses. Stone was limited only to the first story; the upper story was of wood. Another important element was the incorporation of the prehispanic framework, whose interlocking beams and house-posts allowed the structure to sway during an earthquake. House-posts &ldquo;riding&rdquo; on underground ball-shaped rocks have been excavated in some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a> houses. In this vindication of native technology, the stone walls yielded their load-bearing role to the house-posts. In effect, the second floor and roof were supported by the house-posts, which the stone walls covered like a solid screen. This type of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">construction</a> was soon called <strong>arquitectura mestiza</strong> or &ldquo;mixed architecture&rdquo;&mdash;a term used by the Jesuit Ignacio Alzina as early as 1668 because it was partly of wood and partly of stone (Merino 1987, 67).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The character of arquitectura mestiza was further shaped by its builders who were mostly amateurs and artisans. The Philippines, two oceans removed from Spain, was understandably not one of the popular tourist destinations in those days, and very few professional architects made it to these shores. Construction projects were, therefore, initiated and supervised by both civil and religious authorities, especially by parish priests who also took it upon themselves to build <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a>, dams, and irrigation systems. Even then, there was no guarantee that what the friar&rsquo;s hand traced on paper would be faithfully translated into stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actual business of building was done by what were then known as the <strong>maestros de obras</strong> (master builders). These were natives who had practical experience and who learned additional skills from the friars, engineers, and other knowledgeable persons. The Augustinian scholar Luis Merino has theorized that Filipinos were at the helm of construction projects just 20 years after the founding of Manila. The names of these native builders are slowly coming to light. Indications are that the maestro de obras of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">walls of Intramuros</a> in 1591 was a Filipino named Pedro Jusepe. Moreover, Fr Merino has unearthed 1591 documents which confirm that these laborers were paid wages, a practice which is proved by records spanning three centuries (Merino 1987, 51-53).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only during the second half of the 19th century, when the Philippines was enjoying an economic boom, did more and more professional engineers and architects from Spain arrive in the country. It was then that the first Filipino professional architect, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>, arrived from studies abroad to practice his profession. The earthquakes which struck Manila in 1863 and 1880, although disastrous, provided at least one good result: the city engineers got together and finally produced a set of building ordinances designed to reduce the destruction caused by earthquakes. It was observed that edifices constructed after the 1863 earthquake, incorporating scientific building principles, withstood the 1880 catastrophe and suffered little damage. Towards the last decades of the 19th century, there was so much building activities in progress that many builders were caught unaware by the Philippine revolution against Spain. Some churches were lucky to be finished under the American colonial regime; others were never completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The many building requirements issued during the Spanish regime took into consideration the wide variety of materials available in the country. Obviously, the earliest churches, houses, and buildings of the colonial period were made of wood and bamboo. Filipino carpenters were expert at determining which kind of wood was best suited to which functions. Molave, for example, was the best for house-posts, because it was impervious to termites; it could be embedded in the ground without rotting, and it hardened as it aged. Narra was a favorite for <strong>tabla</strong> (floorboards), because of its deep red color and the beautiful sheen it acquired when polished. Nails were not used until much later. Instead, wooden pegs and dovetail joints kept the pieces together; this feature allowed wooden structures a certain flexibility of movement without splitting or breaking apart during earthquakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the discovery of stone quarries in the 1580s by Bp Salazar and Fr Sede&ntilde;o, the art of masonry slowly developed throughout the islands. Buildings of cut stone, such as those in Manila, were described as <strong>de silleria</strong> or <strong>de cal y canto</strong>. Outside Manila the skill of cutting stone spread only gradually, and buildings were erected using variously shaped rocks and river stones; this type of construction, known as rubblework, was called <strong>de mamposteria</strong> or <strong>de cota</strong>. The art of making bricks was also introduced at the same time as building in stone. Clay, molded in rectangular wooden forms, was fired in kilns to produce <strong>ladrillos </strong> (bricks), <strong>tejas</strong> (roof tiles), and <strong>baldosas</strong> (floor tiles). Pavements were also laid with heavy slabs of granite brought by the Chinese junks, which were thus called <strong>piedra china</strong>. Stones and bricks were cemented together using <strong>argamasa</strong> (mortar), a mixture of powdered lime, sand, and water. Lime was obtained from limestone quarries, coral reefs, and seashells. Recounted by Filipino lore and confirmed by historical sources, ingredients such as plant sap, molasses, and even eggs were used to make the mortar more binding and durable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important function of mortar was to protect masonry walls from erosion and moisture brought on by the humid atmosphere and heavy rains. This stucco or plaster was known as <strong>palitada</strong>, after the tool with which it was applied, the <strong>paleta</strong>. This term is a Filipinism, as the lime application in Hispanic countries was known as <strong>enlucido</strong> or <strong>revoque de cal</strong>. In Spain and Latin America, indeed on both European and African sides of the Mediterranean (witness the <strong>casas blancas</strong> or &ldquo;white houses&rdquo; of Andalucia, Spain, and Casablanca, Morocco) the protective application of lime was an age-old tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The palitada, being organic, had to be renewed in a certain number of years. Over the 30-year period between 1827 and 1858, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/268\">church in Baclayon</a> (Bohol) was whitewashed seven times. The system of maintenance ended with the change of Spanish to American hegemony. People got used to seeing their churches in near ruin, with peeling and cracked walls overgrown with <strong>balete</strong> trees. A deep-seated nostalgia in fact stands in the way of the proper conservation of heritage structures. Excited devotees of Pope Francis could not make the connection between the Vatican&rsquo;s immaculately white fa&ccedil;ade and a heritage church&rsquo;s walls purposefully pockmarked to maintain a pleasing backdrop for wedding photos. When the National Museum renewed the plaster over <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\">Fort Pilar</a> in Zamboanga in 2014, several uninformed sectors raised a protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mortar, applied over a screen of interwoven branches and wooden slats produced a thin wall known as <strong>tabique pampango</strong>, which was used primarily for partitions between rooms but sometimes also as exterior walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Glass, which was imported and very expensive, was rarely used in the country. Instead, windowpanes were made from the translucent <strong>capiz</strong> shells, which allowed light to filter through while at the same time acting as a protective barrier. The glass windows for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, built in the 18th century, were imported from Batavia, Indonesia. Other modern materials, such as galvanized iron sheets and Portland cement, were introduced towards the last decades of the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As construction techniques were developed, quarries opened, and kilns constructed, various parts of the country began to show a preference for specific building materials. Most of the buildings in Manila and central Luzon were of <strong>adobe</strong>, a volcanic tuff quarried from the hills which is entirely different from the material of the same name found in Latin America (adobe in those Hispanic countries refers to mud and straw formed into rectangular blocks which are then dried in the sun). In northern Luzon, brick was the essential building material; houses and churches of brick were also built in scattered areas of the archipelago, all the way down to Jolo, Sulu. Towns along the coasts of Luzon, especially from Zambales to Batangas, used roughly hewn blocks of coral stone. Many constructions in the Bicol Peninsula took advantage of the abundant volcanic stone. Throughout the Visayas, the craft of cutting stone or coral was virtually elevated into a fine art, with blocks fitting so precisely into each other that not even a razor blade could be inserted between blocks. The material was so durable that it did not have to be protected with a layer of palitada. The art of cutting these stones was brought by the Visayan settlers to the coastal towns of Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under more than three centuries of Spanish initiative, buildings of wood, stone, and brick were constructed all over the archipelago, from the Batanes Islands in the north to Tawi-Tawi in the south, from Palawan in the west to Samar in the east. These structures may be classified into four main groups, based on their function in the community: military, religious, domestic, and civil.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"military\" name=\"military\"></a>Military Architecture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realizing the perils of their expedition in Cebu, Legazpi and his men erected in 1565 a triangular fort near the coast of the city. Named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/301\">Fort San Pedro</a>, it was a modest palisade of timber which, as it turned out, would be the first in a chain of fortifications erected by the Spaniards throughout the country. In the process of colonizing the Philippines, the Spaniards encountered many enemies: the Portuguese, the Dutch, the British, and the Chinese. Many Filipinos were also resentful of Spanish encroachments and led sorties against the new settlements. Most disgruntled of all were the Igorot peoples of the Cordillera and the Moros, the Muslim peoples of Mindanao and Sulu; both these groups resisted hispanization until the end of the Spanish regime. The Moros in particular erected their own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\"><strong>kuta</strong></a> or forts to protect themselves from the Spaniards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Manila, a palisade of logs was built in 1571 around the new city. The first stone fort Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia was built in the 1580s by Fr Antonio Sede&ntilde;o in one corner of the settlement facing what is now <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Rizal Park</a>. Its foundations were later incorporated into the stone walls enclosing Manila, which were built by Gov-Gen Gomez Perez Dasmari&ntilde;as in the 1590s. During this time another fort was constructed over the ruins of the fortifications of the city&rsquo;s previous Filipino ruler, Soliman; named after Spain&rsquo;s patron saint, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Santiago</a>, it guarded the mouth of the Pasig River. Across the bay from Manila was Cavite, which became the port of call for the galleons; in time this city was also fortified with stone walls and its own fort, named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/300\">San Felipe</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical stone fort had three or more sides called <strong>cortinas</strong>. Above some of these walls were <strong>casamatas</strong> (stone platforms) from which cannons and other artillery aimed outwards. Flanking cortinas on both ends were quadrangular bulwarks known as <strong>baluartes</strong> or <strong>bastiones</strong>. At other corners were perched little turrets, called <strong>garitas</strong>, in which sentinels kept watch. A <strong>foso</strong> (moat) often surrounded the entire fortification, and at the water&rsquo;s outer reaches a low wall called the <strong>falsabraga</strong> provided yet another line of defense. A fortified walled enclosure, known as the <strong>revellin</strong>, was sometimes erected on one side of the main entrance for added protection. Depending on its size, the inside of a fort could include the following: <strong>alojamientos</strong> (living quarters) for the soldiers; <strong>calabozo</strong> (jail), <strong>herreria</strong> (foundry), <strong>almacenes</strong> (warehouse) for powder, provision, and ammunition; <strong>pozo</strong> (well), and even a chapel. In fact, entire churches were incorporated into forts, the entrance to the church also serving as the entrance to the fort. Examples of church fortresses of this kind may still be seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/290\">Cuyo</a> (Palawan), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/279\">Capul</a> (Northern Samar), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/307\">Guiuan</a> (Eastern Samar). In a number of places, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao</a> (Iloilo) and Atimonan (Quezon), the churches themselves doubled as fortresses. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/293\">Dupax</a> (Nueva Vizcaya) the priest&rsquo;s quarters had slit windows from which archers and gunfighters could repel attacks by the unconverted Isinay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an attempt to deter pirate raids from the south into the Visayas and Luzon, the Spaniards built forts in the strategic islands of Palawan, Cuyo, and Culion. They also dared construct stone forts in the homeland of the Moros: Mindanao. These were built in Zamboanga, Basilan, Tandag, Cagayan de Oro, Lanao, Cotabato, and Pangui, in what is now Ozamis City. With the advent of steamships, the Spaniards gained the upper hand and in 1876 conquered Moro territories in the Sulu archipelago. Small stone fortifications rose in the islands of Jolo (Sulu), and Siasi and Bongao (Tawi-Tawi).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the Spaniards had their hands full with the Moros, they also had to contend with other disgruntled Filipinos who lived in the interior. Thus a fort was built in Lubao, Pampanga as a defense against the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a>. In 18th-century Cagayan, forts were constructed in Tuao and five other towns as defenses against the Igorot from the nearby Cordilleras.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the government in Manila was slow in sending help and armaments, it was often left to the parish priest and the townspeople to set up their own defenses. Watchtowers were set up along the coasts to spread warning signals to the nearby towns. While a great number of watchtowers in the Bicol Peninsula were of wood, those built under Augustinian supervision along the coasts of Ilocos, Batangas, and Cebu were of stone, and hence more massive. The Recollects also built stone towers and forts for their parishes in Masbate, Romblon, Bohol, and Negros. In the Visayas, these watchtowers were known as <strong>bantayan sa hari</strong>, or &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s watchtower.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the modernization of shipping, the <strong>farola</strong> (lighthouse) became necessary. Many extant farola&mdash;such as those in Bangui (Ilocos Norte), guarding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/277\">Cape Bojeador</a>; Palauig Island (Cagayan), guarding <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/278\">Cape Enga&ntilde;o</a>; Corregidor, guarding the entrance to Manila Bay; and Capul Island (Northern Samar), guarding the San Bernardino Strait&mdash;were built in the last decades of the 19th century. They were renovated and improved by the Americans in the next century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite all these fortifications, complaints and reports persisted that the colonized settlements were not defended enough. In 1762 the British practically breezed their way to the gates of Manila, the fortified walls of Cavite and Intramuros notwithstanding. After their departure in 1764, an old fort in the district of Malate was rebuilt to improve the defenses; named after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/299\">San Antonio Abad</a>, it was also known as La Polvorista, because it was used as a powder magazine. Ironically, it was over this fort that the Americans first raised the Stars and Stripes in the Battle of Manila in 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"religious\" name=\"religious\"></a>Religious Architecture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Easily the most visible reminder of the Spanish heritage is the Catholic church in the center of most Philippine towns. The great number and variety of this and other religious structures confirm the fact that the Spaniards were here not just for commercial gain but, more importantly, to win souls for God and bring about a Christian culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christianization of the Filipinos was the work of two types of clergy, the religious and the secular. The Spanish kings sent missionaries from the religious congregations who were more organized to handle the work of conversion. In very basic terms, the religious clergy was composed of several congregations, each of which had its own provincial who was responsible to the institution&rsquo;s headquarters in Spain. In the Philippines the most important religious congregations were the Augustinians, Franciscans, Dominicans, Jesuits, and Augustinian Recollects. Except for the Jesuits, these religious clergy were collectively called&nbsp;<em>frailes&nbsp;</em>or friars. Although they were mostly recruited in Spain, a small but significant number also came from Central Europe and Mexico. These missionaries arrived via Mexico in a boatload or <strong>barcada</strong> (whence today&rsquo;s &ldquo;barkada,&rdquo; a peer group). Due to various historical reasons beyond the scope of this work, the great majority of the Filipinos were converted by members of the religious clergy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the secular clergy was formed to administer parishes once they had been Christianized and turned over by the religious clergy. Secular priests were governed by a hierarchy of bishops and archbishops. Mostly drawn from the local population, they initially served in cathedrals and nearby parishes. Their numbers grew in the 19th century, and it was into their hands that the parishes were turned over when the friars left the country in 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest religious structures were churches built for the religious clergy, who lived in adjoining monasteries. The first monastic churches were built for the Augustinians in Cebu and Manila in the same years these cities were taken over by the Spaniards. The mother churches of all the religious orders were concentrated in Intramuros; hence the largest monasteries in the Islands were also located here. From Intramuros the friars set forth to conquer spiritual fields for Christianity, not only throughout the Philippines but also in China, Japan, mainland Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and Guam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smaller monasteries were founded as rest areas and formation centers in the cooler hills around Manila, for example, in San Francisco del Monte for the Franciscans. Sadly, many monasteries in the large towns, such as those for the Dominicans in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/316\">Lal-lo</a> (Cagayan), the Franciscans in Naga (Camarines Sur), and the Recollects in Cebu City have disappeared. Luckily, the 18th-century <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/313\">house of the Jesuits</a> in Cebu City still stands, although it has been converted into a warehouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These monasteries served as headquarters for the religious in certain areas, and thus had many rooms and were quite large. A monastery was basically four sided in plan, with a cloister enclosing an inner courtyard or atrium and the garden, where the friars could meditate. One entered through the <strong>porteria</strong>, the office where records were kept, schedules arranged, and religious prayerbooks sold. The friars met their guests in the <strong>recibidor</strong>, and had their meals in the <strong>refectorio</strong>. In the Augustinian monastery in Intramuros, the refectorio is preceded by a <strong>de profundis</strong> room, where the residents prayed for their deceased companions and benefactors. The wing adjoining the church was reserved for the sacristy, where the priests vested for mass; vestments, utensils, and decorations used for religious rituals were also kept here. Living quarters and recreation rooms were on the second floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The influence of monastery architecture is most obvious in the construction of the parish priest&rsquo;s residence. This building, ordinarily called <strong>casa parroquial</strong> (parish house) in other countries, is until today popularly referred to as the convento, a term originally reserved for houses of monastic communities. Conventos most akin to monasteries are those of the Franciscans along the shores of Laguna de Bay, which are quadrangular cloisters enclosing gardens. Many others were L-shaped, with the church building providing a third side so that the plan resembled a C or a U; although the fourth side was missing, the space for an inner courtyard was still retained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conventos, more than their older and grander cousins, the monasteries, followed the canons of traditional Philippine architecture. Apart from the bedrooms or cells, the <strong>sala</strong> (receiving room) and the <strong>comedor</strong> (dining room) were located on the second floor. An open area called the <strong>azotea</strong>, or <strong>pantaw</strong> in the Visayas, enabled residents to enjoy the cool evening breezes. Elsewhere were spaces for a clinic, classrooms, and storage. In some towns the convento doubled as the municipal hall when this structure was under construction or repair, such as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/382\">Sarrat</a>, Ilocos Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the various kinds of churches in the Philippines, the parish church was the most common. This church indicated that a town had &ldquo;come of age,&rdquo; i.e., it was an independent parish and had its own parish priest. A system of prayers and religious devotions was introduced and maintained by the ringing of the church bells; hence people lived &ldquo;under&rdquo; the sound of the bells or <strong>bajo las campanas</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a town to be elevated to the status of parish, a serviceable church should already have been built in the community. In probably all cases, this primal church was of local light materials, such as bamboo, wood, and thatch. As the parish grew in size and wealth, the church was improved, strengthened, or even rebuilt. There were instructions that as much of the old structure should be used whenever reconstruction was carried out. For example, after the fire of 1707 in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/328\">Majayjay</a>, Laguna, the parish priest enclosed the old, charred walls in layers of brick and masonry work, resulting in new walls that were 3 m thick. Up to the 19th century buttresses were added to reinforce walls against earthquakes. The most outstanding examples of such churches may be seen in Pangasinan, Ilocos, and the Cagayan Valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main longitudinal body of the church was the nave; large churches could have a nave flanked by two aisles. The entrance was through the huge wooden doors of the main entrance. To either one&rsquo;s left or right was the <strong>bautisterio</strong> (baptistry), where newly born babies were baptized into the Christian faith. The placing of the baptistry close to the entrance was symbolic of one&rsquo;s entry into the Christian community. At the far end of the sanctuary was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>altar mayor</strong></a> (main altar), with its elaborately decorated <strong>retablo</strong> or altar screen. In many cases, the church incorporated a <strong>crucero</strong> or transept, which was a hall cutting across the nave just before the main altar, making the floor plan resemble a cross. Over the crossing of the nave and the transept was usually a dome or a tower with windows that illuminated the sanctuary. To one side or behind the main altar was the <strong>sacristia</strong> (sacristy), where the priest and his assistants put on their vestments before celebrating mass. The priest delivered his sermon from the <strong>pulpito</strong> (pulpit), an elevated structure (generally of wood) located at the nave at some distance from the transept. Musicians and singers performed at the <strong>coro</strong> (choir loft), a high platform just behind the main entrance. Following the Spanish tradition, the organ was perched on a loft next to the coro. Most of the congregation were left to stand or kneel; long benches were provided only for the <strong>principales</strong> or leading citizens of the community. At night, members of the religious community prayed from the <strong>tribunas</strong>, balconies on the second floor of the convento overlooking the main altar. The interior of the church was often richly furnished with side altars, paintings, and carvings of religious subjects, but everything was intended to focus attention on the tabernacle at the center of the main altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the convento which was discussed earlier, another integral part of the church was its <strong>campanario</strong>. This structure often adjoined the church building, and its ground floor usually housed the baptistry. Bell towers could be as simple as the four-posted structures of early churches, or imposing, like the solitary monuments of the Ilocos. Only a few churches managed to hang bells from <strong>espada&ntilde;as</strong>, free standing walls with openings which were popular in Latin America. The threat of earthquakes confined their construction to only a small number of churches, chiefly in the north. Bells performed many services for the community, tolling the hours, calling the congregation to worship, announcing important events, and warning of impending danger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church compound was the most dominant feature of any town&rsquo;s architecture. The impressive vista formed by the outlines of the bell tower, church, and convento was enhanced by the spacious yard or <strong>patio</strong> in front of it, which was often enclosed by low stone walls and ringed by venerable acacia trees. A number of churchyards were marked at regular intervals by little shrines for the 14 Stations of the Cross, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">Argao</a>, Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The patio was the site for outdoor ceremonies, like the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\">osana</a>&nbsp;</em>(hosanna) of Palm Sunday, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\">ritual meeting</a> of Christ and his mother Mary on Easter Sunday. For the hosanna, a raised and decorated platform&mdash;the <strong>hosanahan</strong> &mdash;was built to house children, dressed as angels, who sang the hymn &ldquo;Hosanna Filio David.&rdquo; For the meeting of Christ and Mary (<em>sabet&nbsp;</em>in Iloko,&nbsp;<em>salubong&nbsp;</em>in Tagalog, and&nbsp;<em>sugat&nbsp;</em>in Visayan), a tall and elaborate construction of bamboo called <strong>galilea</strong> and resembling a triumphal arch, was built so the images of the Virgin and the Risen Christ could pass under. At signal, a child, dressed as an angel, descended from the apex of the arch to remove the black veil of the Virgin. For fiestas and other occasions, the <strong>arko</strong> (arches) were built not only in the patio but also in strategic spots around town. Some of these arches could be ostentatious architectural structures of wood, sporting features as ogee arches, cartouches, swags, and moldings. The more humble though equally pleasing arch was made of bamboo. Temporary shelters of bamboo, called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2095\"><strong>kubol</strong></a> in Tagalog or <strong>abong-abong</strong> in Ilocano, were built especially for Holy Week and the feast of Corpus Christi. For the latter feast, a procession starting from the church would stop at these structures for benediction and prayer. The kubol resembled the huts, called <strong>tuklong</strong>, made by farmers in their fields. An altar with a santo, candles, and flowers completed the furniture of the hut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One other important part of the church complex was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemetery</a>, which in many parishes was located some distance away from the town center. In the early days the dead were buried inside the church, but this practice was found to be unhygienic. Writing in the 1660s, Alzina noted that coffins to be buried inside the church were required to be of soft wood, so that they would decompose faster and thus eventually leave space for future burials. Subsequent royal decrees called for the provision of graveyards, first in the patio in front of or beside the church. For example, there was a small graveyard in the front of the old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/394\">University of Santo Tomas</a> in Intramuros; the space is now <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Plaza Santo Tomas</a>. Eventually the communities complied, relocating cemeteries to some distance from the town, usually in a well-ventilated area. Cemeteries and their chapels became veritable architectural monuments in themselves; the one in Janiuay, Iloilo won for its builder an award from Spain for its artistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lying outside the town proper were villages or barrios whose inhabitants chose to live near their rice and farm lands. To minister to their spiritual needs, the <strong>visita</strong> system was evolved. Chapels built in selected areas were visited by the priests according to a regular schedule. Variously called <strong>capilla</strong>, <strong>camarin</strong>, <strong>ermita</strong>, <strong>santuario</strong>, tuklong, or visita, a structure of this type was often only of light materials. As the barrio grew, the chapel could be rebuilt in stone. If the residents were numerous enough, they could even petition to be separated from the mother parish and be elevated into an independent parish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To facilitate the religious administration of the islands, the country was divided into several dioceses headed by bishops. At the seat of each diocese, which was often the capital of a region, was a cathedral. By the end of the 19th century the Philippines had six cathedrals: in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/316\">Lallo</a> (Cagayan); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/397\">Vigan</a> (Ilocos Sur); Naga (Camarines Sur); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/286\">Cebu</a>; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/311\">Jaro</a> (Iloilo).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An adjunct to the cathedral was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">bishop&rsquo;s residence</a> which resembled a convento in form, although it was much larger. Unfortunately, all except one of the six structures were destroyed during World War II. The only remaining bishop&rsquo;s residence from this period is the one in Vigan, Ilocos Sur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each diocese was also responsible for the establishment and maintenance of seminaries for the formation of the secular clergy. Due to many problems, however, seminaries were only established in the 18th century. Only one seminary building from this period still stands today: that of the diocese of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/308\">Nueva Caceres</a> in Naga, Camarines Sur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rectangular form appears to have been the basic structure of religious buildings. This form was hardly touched by such concepts as baroque movement, rococo lighting, or gothic structure. Exceptions to these are few but are highly interesting, namely: the Greek cross plan, with all four arms short and equal in length, adopted by the magnificent church of Oton in Iloilo; the round and oval floor plans used for various cemetery chapels; and the undulating facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/372\">San Luis Church</a> in Pampanga, which appears to have been a rare experiment with baroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Western and other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">influences</a> are evident in the various styles of building ornament and furnishings. In the 19th-century Gothic arches, Romanesque recessed portals, Byzantine friezes, and neoclassic columns appeared on facades and walls, enlivening what would otherwise be squat, heavy structures. These, however, were not always precisely copied from Western models, but were interpreted by artisans according to their taste and were often combined with native motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"domestic\" name=\"domestic\"></a>Domestic Architecture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut) is cited as the archetype for domestic architecture during the Spanish regime, the name itself seems to have been coined at a much later period. The two earliest known Tagalog dictionaries (that of Pedro de San Buenaventura OFM, published in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/424\">Pila</a> in 1613, and that attributed to Francisco de San Antonio OFM, who died in 1624) list the generic word for house: <strong>bahay</strong>. Tellingly, there are a number of words for huts or sheds which for the moment are indistinguishable from one another: <strong>balong-balong</strong>, <strong>cohala</strong>, <strong>dalongdong</strong>, <strong>habong</strong>, and <strong>salong</strong>. Those located in the ricefields were the <strong>balag</strong>, <strong>cobo</strong>, and <strong>dangpa</strong>; the <strong>bacocol</strong> was the simplest of all with the ground as its floor. While <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\">barung-barong</a> and dampa are modern descendants of these simple dwellings, no relation was given in the dictionaries of the &ldquo;cobo&rdquo; to its having a &ldquo;cube&rdquo; form. The most dominant house in the community was the <strong>dalam</strong>, which was large enough for the chief, his relatives, and slaves. A house of interlocking boards, perhaps reflecting the new technology, was the <strong>lapat</strong>. Contrary to its use today, the <strong>batalan</strong> was the entrance porch to a house. The <strong>gulang-gulang</strong> was an attachment to the house which seemed to serve as a place of relaxation and gossip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its most basic form, the bahay consisted of four walls enclosing one or more rooms, with the whole structure raised above ground on poles. Contemporary writers have described it as a &ldquo;floating volume.&rdquo; Being in the tropics, the house was designed to allow maximum ventilation. Its large windows and slatted floor insured the flow of air throughout the interior. The floor was raised high enough to minimize moisture from the ground. In the Visayas, it was common in pre-Hispanic times to bury the dead in the ground level or <strong>sirum</strong> (<strong>silong</strong> to the Tagalogs). Bamboo, nipa, cogon grass, <strong>anahaw</strong> leaves, and other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">organic materials</a> were used for the walls and roof. Inside, partitions were kept to a minimum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rainwater slid off quickly from the steep roof, while floods and moist ground were a slight inconvenience as the house was safely above the ground. The bahay was constructed as a community project in the tradition of <strong>bayanihan</strong> or communal cooperation. Most huts were simple and light enough to be carried by family and friends and transferred to another location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inside, the living area was divided into two principal parts. The larger space was the sala or <strong>bulwagan</strong> (living room). On one side or corner of this was the <strong>silid</strong>, a small room where clothes, mats, and pillows were kept. The other space was the <strong>kusina</strong> (kitchen), which had a <strong>banguera</strong>, a window rack made of split bamboo where plates and glasses were exposed to the sun to dry. Next to the kitchen was a roofless extension, also of split bamboo, called the <strong>batalan</strong>, where the family washed and bathed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The simplest house was a one-room affair. Some had an enclosed sleeping room which was often raised a little above the bamboo floor. Although popularly called a <strong>cuarto</strong> after its Spanish equivalent, Pigafetta&rsquo;s observation in 1521 that Cebuano houses had rooms similar to those of the Europeans suggests that this feature may date back to prehispanic times (Pigafetta 1969, 38); moreover, there are native terms for it, such as the Tagalog silid and the Visayan <strong>sulod</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, fire and earthquakes tempered the Spanish penchant for building extravagant mansions, such as those found in Spain and Mexico. Eventually, nature forced the colonizers to appreciate the advantages of the lowly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\">bahay kubo</a>. The reconstruction of the late 17th century <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/360\">Pi&ntilde;ero house</a> in Intramuros by scholars <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5798\">Fernando Zialcita</a> and Martin Tinio Jr (Zialcita 1980, 42- 4) shows us that, although the stone walls reached up to the second floor, some native features had already been adopted. The living quarters were on the second floor, a batalan was provided at the back, and huge molave haligi supported the entire structure. Already present at this date was the <strong>volada</strong>, a cantilevered wooden gallery which was to characterize many arquitectura mestiza houses of the 18th and 19th centuries. The thick, high stone walls may be attributed to the fact that Manila in the 17th century was still suffering from the trauma of the Dutch and Chinese invasions, so that houses were practically mini-fortresses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the fortified Intramuros house, examples of 18th-century houses in the provinces, although exceedingly rare, indicate a more relaxed lifestyle and, in their retention of the basic space allocations of the field hut, represent an evolutionary transition to the 19th-century stone-and-wood houses, called bahay na bato. The modest Palma house in Imus, Cavite very much resembles a bahay kubo, except that its ground floor is enclosed with heavy stone walls. The living quarters are on the second floor. The sala takes up most of the space, and a little cuarto is reached by ascending just two steps. The more massive Ordoveza residence in Majayjay, Laguna also retains the traditional two-level arrangement, with the living quarters on the upper floor. There is a large sala, which leads to several cuartos. The dining room and the batalan are at the back. Solid houseposts go all the way to the ceiling, supporting the second story and the roof timbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to economic gains and the rise of the&nbsp;<em>mestizo sangley&nbsp;</em>or Filipino-Chinese class in the 19th century, a number of Filipinos became wealthy enough to build their own bahay na bato. Some of the finest of these are in the towns of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Taal</a>, Batangas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, Ilocos Sur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Taal houses, the volada came to its full development. This gallery, whose name is derived from the Spanish word &ldquo;to fly,&rdquo; projected outward from the first-story wall, providing shade to pedestrians below. The slatted floor of the bahay kubo was now replaced with wide floorboards called <strong>tablas</strong>. Since the floor no longer admitted air, openings called <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows) were provided between the floor and the windowsills. When the sliding panels of both ventanillas and windows were opened, the walls of the upper floor practically disappeared. Enhanced by the decorative tracery, wrought-iron work, and <strong>calados</strong> or wooden fretwork, the whole house resembled a huge bird cage (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3845\">Zobel de Ayala</a> 1963, 28). The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Marcela Agoncillo house</a> typifies the Taal bahay na bato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until recently Philippine colonial houses were described as Antillan, because they seemed to resemble houses in the Antilles or West Indies. Upon closer scrutiny, however, the notion of similarity had to be given up. Among other reasons, the enclosed volada sets the bahay na bato apart from its cousins in colonial America, where the balconies were generally exposed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, principal town of the Ilocos region, many homeowners chose to build both stories in brick, which was available in large quantities. With the massive walls, the volada disappeared in many residences and the kitchen became an extension in stone, with vents piercing the walls to let out smoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different regions evolved their own building styles, depending on the materials available. In the northernmost province of Batanes, which is often hit by storms, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2353\">Ivatan</a> built houses of stone. The wall facing the strongest winds was always left windowless. Since adobe lends itself to sculpture, houses in Bulacan had facades decorated with carved flowers, leaves, and religious symbols. The abundance of white coral stone provided the character for houses in the Visayas and Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the growing complexity of life in the 19th century, space in the bahay na bato was allocated for specific purposes. The entrance was through the <strong>zaguan</strong>, a hall on the ground floor. As in the bahay kubo, much of the ground level was reserved for storage; in business districts some spaces were rented to shops. Horses for carriages were housed in stables called <strong>caballerizas</strong>. Ascending the <strong>escalera</strong> (grand staircase), the visitor waited to be received at the <strong>caida</strong> or <strong>antesala</strong> or a large room where informal entertaining took place. The sala, often the largest room in the house, was reserved for special functions such as&nbsp;<em>tertulias&nbsp;</em>or evening soirees. Displayed here were family portraits and the best <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a>. At one end of the living room was the <strong>comedor</strong> (dining room), which led to the kusina with its ever practical banguera. To one side of the kitchen was the bathroom, with toilet. The batalan was now transformed into the azotea, an outdoor terrace where the residents and their guests repaired to during cool clear nights. There were a number of bedrooms or cuartos which opened onto the sala. The upper part of partitions consisted of wooden fretwork called calados, which allowed air to circulate at ceiling height.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although retaining the basic box-like form, the 19th-century bahay na bato reflected changing tastes through the incorporation of motifs from the prevalent styles. Neoclassic decorations included columns, caryatids, and friezes adopted from Greek and Roman architecture. Ogee or pointed arches over doors and windows were marks of the gothic revival. It was not uncommon to mix elements from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">different styles</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"civil\" name=\"civil\"></a>Civil Architecture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once established in Manila, the Spaniards commenced the construction of a number of buildings for the various offices needed in running the colony. These buildings, which represent probably the least known class of colonial architecture in the country, may be grouped under three types based on their function: administrative, social, and commercial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flanking the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Plaza Mayor of Manila</a> were two of the most important administrative buildings in the land. The first was known by various names: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/266\"><strong>casa del ayuntamiento</strong></a>, <strong>casa del cabildo</strong>, <strong>casa consistorial</strong>, <strong>casa real</strong>. This sprawling building was the seat of the country&rsquo;s government. It contained numerous administrative offices and the archives. On the second floor was a large hall where state banquets and balls were held. Across the ayuntamiento was the residence of the highest official of the land: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\"><strong>palacio del gobernador general</strong></a> or <strong>palacio real</strong>. On the second floor was the residence of the governor general and his family; in another part was the Real Audiencia or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\">tribunal</a>, until its abolition in the 18th century. The ayuntamiento and the palacio, both made of stone, had two stories and spacious inner courtyards. Like many buildings in the country, they had to be rebuilt quite a few times because of fires and earthquakes. The earthquake of 1863 totally destroyed the governor general&rsquo;s palace. It was never rebuilt; instead the governor general moved his quarters to a vacation house, called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a>, farther up the Pasig River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Smaller versions of the ayuntamiento were built in towns all over the country, and were referred to as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\">casa real</a>, <strong>casa de comunidad</strong>, casa municipal, or simply <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\"><strong>municipio</strong></a>. Symbolizing the secular power of the state, it stood at one end of the town plaza, facing the symbol of religious power, the church. Some towns, proud of their status as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\">capitals</a> of the province, erected stone archways at the entrance to the poblacion. Such structures still exist in Pagsanjan, former capital of Laguna, and in Bucay, former capital of Abra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>casa hacienda</strong> was the administrative building for the hacienda or landed estate. This consisted of one or more sprawling edifices housing quarters for the administrators and workers, kitchens, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">storerooms</a>, carpentry shops, stables, and of course, a chapel. The casa hacienda built by the Augustinians in 1716 in Mandaluyong is one of the oldest in existence. Today it houses the Don Bosco Technical School for Boys. The estate houses of the Dominicans in Naic (Cavite) and Calamba (Laguna) are also still standing, although they have been rehabilitated for different functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A large number of buildings may be classified as social buildings. Contrary to popular belief, the Spaniards attended to the various needs of the population with a concern that in many ways surpassed that shown by other European countries for their own people. Foremost among these was education, which for the greater part of the Spanish regime was administered by the religious orders. In the middle of the 18th century, Intramuros could boast of at least six <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a> within its walls. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/394\">Universidad de Santo Tomas</a> was founded in 1611 by the Dominicans. Other schools were the Colegio de San Phelipe, the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, the Colegio de San Jose, the Colegio de Santa Isabel, and the Real Colegio de Santa Potenciana. In Vigan there was the Colegio de San Pablo; in Naga, the Colegio de Santa Isabel; and in Cebu, the Colegio de San Ildefonso. Separate buildings for public schools, popularly called <strong>escuelas pias</strong>, began to be constructed in the 19th century. A few large towns ventured to open vocational schools. The Escuela de Artes y Oficios de Bacolor in Pampanga was rebuilt in 1892 after it was damaged by fire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the schools in Intramuros began as orphanages. In the 19th century two more of such institutions were established: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">Hospicio de San Jose</a> and the Asilo de San Vicente de Paul. Both these charitable institutions enjoyed the luxury of spacious buildings and wide inner courtyards, in the center of which stood a chapel. The Hospicio nestled on the picturesque Isla de Convalescencia on the Pasig River.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">first hospital</a> was set up in Manila by the Franciscans in 1578. It was later turned over to the Order of San Juan de Dios, which built a beautiful stone hospital and church in the 18th century. Three other hospitals were established in Manila: the Hospital Real, which was reserved only for the Spaniards; the Hospital de San Gabriel, for the Chinese; and the Hospital de San Lazaro, for the natives and lepers. In the port of Cavite, an important military station, there were two hospitals: San Juan de Dios within the city walls, and Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de los Dolores in Ca&ntilde;acao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Places for recreation were limited to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/242\">cockpits</a>, and the occasional bullfight (with the occasional female bullfighters, as attested to by announcements of the era). Stages for theatrical productions were constructed during special events such as fiestas, after which they were dismantled. The stages used for the production of the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a>&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\">sinakulo</a>&nbsp;</em>consisted of a platform raised on bamboo or timber supports. A painted backdrop, called&nbsp;<em>telon</em>, formed the back of the stage. Behind the telon, performers dressed and waited for their cues. The stage area could be roofed with thatch. Because stages were ad hoc structures, there was only a handful of permanently built theaters. Those in Manila were constructed outside Intramuros. The most substantially built was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">Teatro de Binondo</a>, which had stone walls and a colonnade on the second floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vastly popular were the cockpits, huge arenas of light materials covered with thatch. Venue for a pastime that not even the Spaniards could eradicate, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/242\"><strong>sabungan</strong></a>, as it is called in several Philippine languages, was an integral part of any important festivity. Today there is a cockpit in virtually every town. For bullfights, temporary wooden amphitheatres were built; the arena floor was of packed earth. Horse racing gained a foothold when a hippodrome was built in Santa Ana, Manila in 1867. Presumably the viewing decks were constructed of the same materials as those of cockpits, although perhaps were a bit sturdier. When the Americans arrived in 1898, they found the races always well attended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buildings for commercial purposes ranged from diminutive sidewalk stalls to huge factories. In nearly every town the Chinese were the chief suppliers of basic goods and supplies. In large towns, such as Manila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a>, there was a special district for them called the <strong>parian</strong>, to which the townspeople flocked for their household needs. In 1758, a large commercial building was inaugurated in the populous Chinese village of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, just across the river from Intramuros. Known as the Alcaiceria de San Fernando, the edifice was octagonal and contained several shops run by Chinese merchants. By the 1790s the merchants had been moved to another parian within Intramuros. The old Alcaiceria was destroyed by fire in 1810 and not rebuilt, perhaps because by then many other stores and shops had already opened. The largest, fanciest, and most prestigious companies were eventually established along a nearby street called the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>; by the second half of the 19th century this was the most important commercial district in the country. The opening of Manila as a free port encouraged British, German, French, Danish and other foreigners to set up businesses on the Escolta and adjacent streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the vigorous upswing in trade in the 19th century, many other types of buildings emerged. Factories were set up to process, among other things, beer, liquor, and cigars. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory</a>, with its intricate neo-Mudejar motifs, was a good example of a building which combined commerce and art. Stone granaries and storehouses were constructed in the big market towns; rich families had their own camarin or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\"><strong>camalig</strong></a>. Interestingly, the same Tagalog dictionaries mentioned earlier in this section define the camalig as a shed or building where ships such as the <strong>balangay</strong> were docked; a similar naval storage facility was the <strong>bantilan</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A monumental customs house, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/260\">Aduana</a>, was constructed in the 1820s in a portion of Intramuros along the banks of the Pasig. The first bank, the Banco Espa&ntilde;ol-Filipino de Isabel II, originally housed in the Aduana, moved in 1862 to its own building elsewhere in Intramuros. The second bank, the Monte de Piedad, first held office at the Colegio de Santa Isabel in Intramuros then moved to a new building in the Santa Cruz district; this edifice was notable for its temple-like facade in the neoclassic style. In the late 1880s a railway system was established, and the central train station at Tutuban was constructed. A number of smaller train stations were set up along the Manila-Dagupan line.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"epilogue\" name=\"epilogue\"></a>Epilogue</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The great cultural surge in Manila and the rest of the country in the 19th century was celebrated in its vibrant architecture, from the bahay kubo to the bahay na bato, from the visita to the catedral, from the sabungan to the factory. But time and nature&mdash;and human beings&mdash;have conspired to erase this memory. Those that have survived to this day, so precious precisely because they are so few, are a constant reminder of the worlds nurtured throughout the Hispanic past. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a></strong></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Related Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\">Bahay na Bato</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\">Casa Real</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">Kuta</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">Palacio</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">Simbahan</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">Teatro</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">Tulay</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Ahlborn, Richard H. 1958. &ldquo;Spanish-Philippine Churches: An Interpretation.&rdquo; <i>Exchange News Quarterly</i>, Oct-Dec.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.

This event brought the Philippines into the orbit of what evolved into the Spanish empire and exposed the islands to influences which may be called Hispanic rather than just Spanish. For these <a href=\"/2/4/217\">influences</a> came from the many groups in Spain, including the Castillians, Basques, Galicians, Andalucians, and Portuguese (the latter were to form their own country in 1640). Included here as well were Islamic traditions merged with the Iberian under the name Mudejar. There were also close connections with the Flemish, Italians and Slavs, such as the Poles and Czechs. Counted among the Hispanic world of the Americas were the Mexicans, who called themselves Novohispanos, Peruvians, and several other nations."

				"value": "It is generally acknowledged that the Philippines is the bastion of Christianity in the Orient. Some scholars believe that, because of this, the country absorbed the greatest degree of influence from the west in the Asian region, losing much of its identity in the process. Other scholars believe, however, that all these influences were really assimilated by the older ethnic base, which actually indigenized them. For example, the Spanish word for church, <strong>iglesia</strong>, never became fully accepted among the Filipinos, who used their own terms to denote a place of worship. Thus the <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> and <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> use <strong>simbahan</strong>, the <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <strong>simbaan</strong>, and the <a href=\"/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, <strong>pisamban</strong>. This process of indigenization was to characterize much of Filipino construction during the more than three centuries of Spanish colonization."

In <a href=\"/2/10/417\">Cebu</a>, Legaspi&#x2019;s men founded a city, built a chapel, and erected a fort. The Spaniards then spent a short while in <a href=\"/2/10/420\">Iloilo</a>, but because of promising reports they continued further north to <a href=\"/2/10/421\">Manila</a>. In 1571 they took over the charred remains of the settlement of the city&#x2019;s previous native ruler Sulayman. Legaspi then traced the borders of the new Hispanic city on the strategic tongue of land at the mouth of the Pasig River."

				"value": "From the beginnings of Hispanic Manila may already be discerned the patterns which were to characterize much of colonial <a href=\"/2/4/214\">town planning</a> throughout the country. Streets were built at right angles to each other, with the resulting layout appearing like a huge chessboard. There was a huge, open square, called the <strong>plaza</strong>, around which were situated the most important buildings of the city: the cathedral, the <a href=\"/2/5/237\">governor general&#x2019;s palace</a>, the tribunal, and the city council. Secondary plazas were later constructed in different parts of the city. Since the city was located by the sea, an additional ordinance was followed: the main plaza was located close to the waterfront. For pueblos or towns located inland, the plaza was ordinarily placed in the center."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Although the plaza evolved in Spain and other European countries during the Renaissance, it was in the Spanish colonies in America that the plaza complex was fully developed and exploited. The Philippines was, therefore, the recipient of much of the town-planning experience gained in the New World. The center of a church patio was marked by a large cross, which in early days was very well carved with flowers and foliage. The plaza became the heart of community life, and came to reflect the various traditions of the inhabitants. On festive occasions such as Easter, cockfights or bullfights were held."

The first buildings were of wood and bamboo, <a href=\"/2/6/253\">materials</a> the Filipinos had been working expertly with since early times. Roofs were of nipa palm or cogon grass, and doubtless these primary constructions resembled the native residences. The Jesuit Ignacio Alzina, writing a century after the beginning of Spanish occupation, still encountered in the 1660s some of the first churches built in the Visayas. One had beams of ebony or <strong>mabolo</strong>. Some houses even dated to before the Spanish arrival. Alzina judged that, with the earthquakes, stone houses were not practical; wooden buildings were more adapted to the landscape."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "After a fire destroyed wooden Manila in 1583, stone was considered a better building material. Quarries along the Pasig River provided building blocks, and kilns in Tondo, Morong, and San Mateo produced lime for a new construction surge in Manila. The Franciscans still used wood in rebuilding their church, but roofed it with clay tiles instead of thatch. <a href=\"/2/2/2700\">Fr Antonio Sede&#xF1;o</a> convinced Bp Salazar to have his residence built in stone, the first such construction in the islands. About 1585, the Jesuit also directed the building of the stone tower, Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de Guia, the first defense on the southern flank of Manila. Due to the inexperience of its builders, this tower had to be reinforced later with four large buttresses. The Augustinians began constructing <a href=\"/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a>, their stone church and monastery, in 1586. This church, completed in 1604, has survived to this day, and thus merits being recognized as the oldest church building in the Philippines. It also featured that daring novelty: an arched vault over the nave of stone, which has amazingly survived to this day. By 1587 Gov-Gen Santiago de Vera (1584-89) required all buildings in Manila to be built of stone. Accordingly, the cathedral of Manila had walls of stone reaching 2 <strong>brazas</strong> (approximately 12 ft) by 1588; due to perennial lack of funds it was only finished in 1614."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Gov-Gen Gomez Perez Dasmari&#xF1;as, who arrived in 1590, continued the impetus for stone masonry in Manila. Fr Sede&#xF1;o directed the building of the first Jesuit stone and brick church, dedicated to Santa Ana, in 1590. Like San Agustin, it featured a stone vault when it was completed in 1596. The Dominicans built their church of stone, <a href=\"/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo</a>, from about 1590 to 1592. In 1591, Gov-Gen Dasmari&#xF1;as commenced the rebuilding of <a href=\"/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> in stone, and connected it to the tower of Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de Guia with a solid masonry wall. This stone <strong>cortina</strong> protecting the seaside from erosion was extended all around the settlement, which gave rise to the walled city of Manila or <a href=\"/2/10/421\"><strong>Intramuros</strong></a> (&#x201C;inside the walls&#x201D;). The Colegio de Santa Potenciana, a boarding school for orphan Spanish girls located behind San Agustin church, was built of stone in 1592-1594. The Franciscans finally decided to rebuild their mother church, dedicated to Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de los Angeles, in stone in 1602."

				"value": "To be sure, Manila was not the only scene of new construction in stone. Fr Gaspar de San Agustin, who published a history of the Augustinians in the Philippines in 1698, mentioned at least two instances outside the city walls. In Pasig, down by the river of the same name, Fr Diego de Moxica built a convento of stone before he died in 1584. In Malate, a district just south of Manila, a convento of &#x201C;good stone arches&#x201D; rose in the 1590s."

				"value": "Thus the last decade of the 16th and the first decades of the 17th century enclose what has been called the first golden age of building in stone. Glowing accounts of towering palaces and splendid mansions reached the Peninsula. However, the ambitious plans of the Spaniards were sorely tested when earthquakes succeeding one another in 1599 and 1600 and again in 1645 struck Manila. As one writer quipped, citizens were no longer roasted; they were crushed instead. The stone vault of the Jesuits&#x2019; Santa Ana collapsed in the earthquake of 1599. The Dominicans decided to build another church with foundations strong enough to support a stone vault to replace its roof of wood which caught fire in 1603. The work of ten years was ruined in the earthquake of 1645; what was left standing collapsed in another tremor in 1658."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The twin dangers of fire and earthquake gradually gave rise to another type of architecture. New edifices rarely rose to more than two floors, with the significant exception of churches. Stone walls expanded to as much as 3 m thick, and buildings started to sprout buttresses. Stone was limited only to the first story; the upper story was of wood. Another important element was the incorporation of the prehispanic framework, whose interlocking beams and house-posts allowed the structure to sway during an earthquake. House-posts &#x201C;riding&#x201D; on underground ball-shaped rocks have been excavated in some <a href=\"/2/10/429\">Vigan</a> houses. In this vindication of native technology, the stone walls yielded their load-bearing role to the house-posts. In effect, the second floor and roof were supported by the house-posts, which the stone walls covered like a solid screen. This type of <a href=\"/2/6/253\">construction</a> was soon called <strong>arquitectura mestiza</strong> or &#x201C;mixed architecture&#x201D;&#x2014;a term used by the Jesuit Ignacio Alzina as early as 1668 because it was partly of wood and partly of stone (Merino 1987, 67)."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The character of arquitectura mestiza was further shaped by its builders who were mostly amateurs and artisans. The Philippines, two oceans removed from Spain, was understandably not one of the popular tourist destinations in those days, and very few professional architects made it to these shores. Construction projects were, therefore, initiated and supervised by both civil and religious authorities, especially by parish priests who also took it upon themselves to build <a href=\"/2/5/251\">bridges</a>, dams, and irrigation systems. Even then, there was no guarantee that what the friar&#x2019;s hand traced on paper would be faithfully translated into stone."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The actual business of building was done by what were then known as the <strong>maestros de obras</strong> (master builders). These were natives who had practical experience and who learned additional skills from the friars, engineers, and other knowledgeable persons. The Augustinian scholar Luis Merino has theorized that Filipinos were at the helm of construction projects just 20 years after the founding of Manila. The names of these native builders are slowly coming to light. Indications are that the maestro de obras of the <a href=\"/2/8/310\">walls of Intramuros</a> in 1591 was a Filipino named Pedro Jusepe. Moreover, Fr Merino has unearthed 1591 documents which confirm that these laborers were paid wages, a practice which is proved by records spanning three centuries (Merino 1987, 51-53)."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Only during the second half of the 19th century, when the Philippines was enjoying an economic boom, did more and more professional engineers and architects from Spain arrive in the country. It was then that the first Filipino professional architect, <a href=\"/2/2/2696\">Felix Roxas Sr</a>, arrived from studies abroad to practice his profession. The earthquakes which struck Manila in 1863 and 1880, although disastrous, provided at least one good result: the city engineers got together and finally produced a set of building ordinances designed to reduce the destruction caused by earthquakes. It was observed that edifices constructed after the 1863 earthquake, incorporating scientific building principles, withstood the 1880 catastrophe and suffered little damage. Towards the last decades of the 19th century, there was so much building activities in progress that many builders were caught unaware by the Philippine revolution against Spain. Some churches were lucky to be finished under the American colonial regime; others were never completed."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The many building requirements issued during the Spanish regime took into consideration the wide variety of materials available in the country. Obviously, the earliest churches, houses, and buildings of the colonial period were made of wood and bamboo. Filipino carpenters were expert at determining which kind of wood was best suited to which functions. Molave, for example, was the best for house-posts, because it was impervious to termites; it could be embedded in the ground without rotting, and it hardened as it aged. Narra was a favorite for <strong>tabla</strong> (floorboards), because of its deep red color and the beautiful sheen it acquired when polished. Nails were not used until much later. Instead, wooden pegs and dovetail joints kept the pieces together; this feature allowed wooden structures a certain flexibility of movement without splitting or breaking apart during earthquakes."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "With the discovery of stone quarries in the 1580s by Bp Salazar and Fr Sede&#xF1;o, the art of masonry slowly developed throughout the islands. Buildings of cut stone, such as those in Manila, were described as <strong>de silleria</strong> or <strong>de cal y canto</strong>. Outside Manila the skill of cutting stone spread only gradually, and buildings were erected using variously shaped rocks and river stones; this type of construction, known as rubblework, was called <strong>de mamposteria</strong> or <strong>de cota</strong>. The art of making bricks was also introduced at the same time as building in stone. Clay, molded in rectangular wooden forms, was fired in kilns to produce <strong>ladrillos </strong> (bricks), <strong>tejas</strong> (roof tiles), and <strong>baldosas</strong> (floor tiles). Pavements were also laid with heavy slabs of granite brought by the Chinese junks, which were thus called <strong>piedra china</strong>. Stones and bricks were cemented together using <strong>argamasa</strong> (mortar), a mixture of powdered lime, sand, and water. Lime was obtained from limestone quarries, coral reefs, and seashells. Recounted by Filipino lore and confirmed by historical sources, ingredients such as plant sap, molasses, and even eggs were used to make the mortar more binding and durable."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Another important function of mortar was to protect masonry walls from erosion and moisture brought on by the humid atmosphere and heavy rains. This stucco or plaster was known as <strong>palitada</strong>, after the tool with which it was applied, the <strong>paleta</strong>. This term is a Filipinism, as the lime application in Hispanic countries was known as <strong>enlucido</strong> or <strong>revoque de cal</strong>. In Spain and Latin America, indeed on both European and African sides of the Mediterranean (witness the <strong>casas blancas</strong> or &#x201C;white houses&#x201D; of Andalucia, Spain, and Casablanca, Morocco) the protective application of lime was an age-old tradition."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The palitada, being organic, had to be renewed in a certain number of years. Over the 30-year period between 1827 and 1858, the <a href=\"/2/8/268\">church in Baclayon</a> (Bohol) was whitewashed seven times. The system of maintenance ended with the change of Spanish to American hegemony. People got used to seeing their churches in near ruin, with peeling and cracked walls overgrown with <strong>balete</strong> trees. A deep-seated nostalgia in fact stands in the way of the proper conservation of heritage structures. Excited devotees of Pope Francis could not make the connection between the Vatican&#x2019;s immaculately white fa&#xE7;ade and a heritage church&#x2019;s walls purposefully pockmarked to maintain a pleasing backdrop for wedding photos. When the National Museum renewed the plaster over <a href=\"/2/8/296\">Fort Pilar</a> in Zamboanga in 2014, several uninformed sectors raised a protest."
			},

				"value": "Glass, which was imported and very expensive, was rarely used in the country. Instead, windowpanes were made from the translucent <strong>capiz</strong> shells, which allowed light to filter through while at the same time acting as a protective barrier. The glass windows for the <a href=\"/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, built in the 18th century, were imported from Batavia, Indonesia. Other modern materials, such as galvanized iron sheets and Portland cement, were introduced towards the last decades of the 19th century."
			},

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "As construction techniques were developed, quarries opened, and kilns constructed, various parts of the country began to show a preference for specific building materials. Most of the buildings in Manila and central Luzon were of <strong>adobe</strong>, a volcanic tuff quarried from the hills which is entirely different from the material of the same name found in Latin America (adobe in those Hispanic countries refers to mud and straw formed into rectangular blocks which are then dried in the sun). In northern Luzon, brick was the essential building material; houses and churches of brick were also built in scattered areas of the archipelago, all the way down to Jolo, Sulu. Towns along the coasts of Luzon, especially from Zambales to Batangas, used roughly hewn blocks of coral stone. Many constructions in the Bicol Peninsula took advantage of the abundant volcanic stone. Throughout the Visayas, the craft of cutting stone or coral was virtually elevated into a fine art, with blocks fitting so precisely into each other that not even a razor blade could be inserted between blocks. The material was so durable that it did not have to be protected with a layer of palitada. The art of cutting these stones was brought by the Visayan settlers to the coastal towns of Mindanao."

These structures may be classified into four main groups, based on their function in the community: military, religious, domestic, and civil."

Depending on its size, the inside of a fort could include the following: <strong>alojamientos</strong> (living quarters) for the soldiers; <strong>calabozo</strong> (jail), <strong>herreria</strong> (foundry), <strong>almacenes</strong> (warehouse) for powder, provision, and ammunition; <strong>pozo</strong> (well), and even a chapel. In fact, entire churches were incorporated into forts, the entrance to the church also serving as the entrance to the fort. Examples of church fortresses of this kind may still be seen in <a href=\"/2/8/290\">Cuyo</a> (Palawan), <a href=\"/2/8/279\">Capul</a> (Northern Samar), and <a href=\"/2/8/307\">Guiuan</a> (Eastern Samar). In a number of places, such as <a href=\"/2/8/342\">Miag-ao</a> (Iloilo) and Atimonan (Quezon), the churches themselves doubled as fortresses. In <a href=\"/2/8/293\">Dupax</a> (Nueva Vizcaya) the priest&#x2019;s quarters had slit windows from which archers and gunfighters could repel attacks by the unconverted Isinay."

Neoclassic decorations included columns, caryatids, and friezes adopted from Greek and Roman architecture. Ogee or pointed arches over doors and windows were marks of the gothic revival. It was not uncommon to mix elements from <a href=\"/2/4/217\">different styles</a>."

The first was known by various names: <a href=\"/2/8/266\"><strong>casa del ayuntamiento</strong></a>, <strong>casa del cabildo</strong>, <strong>casa consistorial</strong>, <strong>casa real</strong>. This sprawling building was the seat of the country&#x2019;s government. It contained numerous administrative offices and the archives. On the second floor was a large hall where state banquets and balls were held. Across the ayuntamiento was the residence of the highest official of the land: the <a href=\"/2/5/237\"><strong>palacio del gobernador general</strong></a> or <strong>palacio real</strong>. On the second floor was the residence of the governor general and his family; in another part was the Real Audiencia or <a href=\"/2/5/249\">tribunal</a>, until its abolition in the 18th century. The ayuntamiento and the palacio, both made of stone, had two stories and spacious inner courtyards. Like many buildings in the country, they had to be rebuilt quite a few times because of fires and earthquakes. The earthquake of 1863 totally destroyed the governor general&#x2019;s palace. It was never rebuilt; instead the governor general moved his quarters to a vacation house, called <a href=\"/2/8/330\">Malaca&#xF1;an</a>, farther up the Pasig River."

Symbolizing the secular power of the state, it stood at one end of the town plaza, facing the symbol of religious power, the church. Some towns, proud of their status as <a href=\"/2/5/231\">capitals</a> of the province, erected stone archways at the entrance to the poblacion.

This consisted of one or more sprawling edifices housing quarters for the administrators and workers, kitchens, <a href=\"/2/5/230\">storerooms</a>, carpentry shops, stables, and of course, a chapel. The casa hacienda built by the Augustinians in 1716 in Mandaluyong is one of the oldest in existence. Today it houses the Don Bosco Technical School for Boys. The estate houses of the Dominicans in Naic (Cavite) and Calamba (Laguna) are also still standing, although they have been rehabilitated for different functions."

Contrary to popular belief, the Spaniards attended to the various needs of the population with a concern that in many ways surpassed that shown by other European countries for their own people. Foremost among these was education, which for the greater part of the Spanish regime was administered by the religious orders. In the middle of the 18th century, Intramuros could boast of at least six <a href=\"/2/5/225\">schools</a> within its walls. The <a href=\"/2/8/394\">Universidad de Santo Tomas</a> was founded in 1611 by the Dominicans. Other schools were the Colegio de San Phelipe, the Colegio de San Juan de Letran, the Colegio de San Jose, the Colegio de Santa Isabel, and the Real Colegio de Santa Potenciana. In Vigan there was the Colegio de San Pablo; in Naga, the Colegio de Santa Isabel; and in Cebu, the Colegio de San Ildefonso. Separate buildings for public schools, popularly called <strong>escuelas pias</strong>, began to be constructed in the 19th century. A few large towns ventured to open vocational schools. The Escuela de Artes y Oficios de Bacolor in Pampanga was rebuilt in 1892 after it was damaged by fire."

In the 19th century two more of such institutions were established: the <a href=\"/2/5/236\">Hospicio de San Jose</a> and the Asilo de San Vicente de Paul. Both these charitable institutions enjoyed the luxury of spacious buildings and wide inner courtyards, in the center of which stood a chapel. The Hospicio nestled on the picturesque Isla de Convalescencia on the Pasig River."

It was later turned over to the Order of San Juan de Dios, which built a beautiful stone hospital and church in the 18th century. Three other hospitals were established in Manila: the Hospital Real, which was reserved only for the Spaniards; the Hospital de San Gabriel, for the Chinese; and the Hospital de San Lazaro, for the natives and lepers. In the port of Cavite, an important military station, there were two hospitals: San Juan de Dios within the city walls, and Nuestra Se&#xF1;ora de los Dolores in Ca&#xF1;acao."

Stages for theatrical productions were constructed during special events such as fiestas, after which they were dismantled. The stages used for the production of the&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/7/55/456\">komedya</a>&#xA0;</em>or the&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/7/55/475\">sinakulo</a>&#xA0;</em>consisted of a platform raised on bamboo or timber supports. A painted backdrop, called&#xA0;<em>telon</em>, formed the back of the stage. Behind the telon, performers dressed and waited for their cues. The stage area could be roofed with thatch. Because stages were ad hoc structures, there was only a handful of permanently built theaters. Those in Manila were constructed outside Intramuros. The most substantially built was the <a href=\"/2/5/247\">Teatro de Binondo</a>, which had stone walls and a colonnade on the second floor."

Venue for a pastime that not even the Spaniards could eradicate, the <a href=\"/2/5/242\"><strong>sabungan</strong></a>, as it is called in several Philippine languages, was an integral part of any important festivity. Today there is a cockpit in virtually every town. For bullfights, temporary wooden amphitheatres were built; the arena floor was of packed earth. Horse racing gained a foothold when a hippodrome was built in Santa Ana, Manila in 1867. Presumably the viewing decks were constructed of the same materials as those of cockpits, although perhaps were a bit sturdier. When the Americans arrived in 1898, they found the races always well attended."

In large towns, such as Manila, <a href=\"/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, <a href=\"/2/10/423\">Malolos</a>, and <a href=\"/2/10/417\">Cebu</a>, there was a special district for them called the <strong>parian</strong>, to which the townspeople flocked for their household needs. In 1758, a large commercial building was inaugurated in the populous Chinese village of <a href=\"/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, just across the river from Intramuros. Known as the Alcaiceria de San Fernando, the edifice was octagonal and contained several shops run by Chinese merchants. By the 1790s the merchants had been moved to another parian within Intramuros. The old Alcaiceria was destroyed by fire in 1810 and not rebuilt, perhaps because by then many other stores and shops had already opened. The largest, fanciest, and most prestigious companies were eventually established along a nearby street called the <a href=\"/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>; by the second half of the 19th century this was the most important commercial district in the country. The opening of Manila as a free port encouraged British, German, French, Danish and other foreigners to set up businesses on the Escolta and adjacent streets."

The <a href=\"/2/10/415\">La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory</a>, with its intricate neo-Mudejar motifs, was a good example of a building which combined commerce and art. Stone granaries and storehouses were constructed in the big market towns; rich families had their own camarin or <a href=\"/2/5/230\"><strong>camalig</strong></a>. Interestingly, the same Tagalog dictionaries mentioned earlier in this section define the camalig as a shed or building where ships such as the <strong>balangay</strong> were docked; a similar naval storage facility was the <strong>bantilan</strong>."

The first bank, the Banco Espa&#xF1;ol-Filipino de Isabel II, originally housed in the Aduana, moved in 1862 to its own building elsewhere in Intramuros. The second bank, the Monte de Piedad, first held office at the Colegio de Santa Isabel in Intramuros then moved to a new building in the Santa Cruz district; this edifice was notable for its temple-like facade in the neoclassic style. In the late 1880s a railway system was established, and the central train station at Tutuban was constructed. A number of smaller train stations were set up along the Manila-Dagupan line."

Over three centuries of Spanish rule came to an end, and five decades of American rule began. The independence won by the Philippine Revolution of 1896 and the First Republic (1899-1901) under Emilio Aguinaldo were not recognized by Spain, nor by the United States, whose naval and military forces had taken Manila on the pretext of aiding the revolution. In 1898 Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States, and after three years of the Philippine-American War, the Americans established a civil government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a new regime came a new culture. The English language was introduced and propagated through the newly established public school system. A new consciousness developed among the native population as American colonial policy focused on education, public health, free enterprise, and preparation for self-government. The landscape was transformed as highways, bridges, ports, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">markets</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a>, hospitals, and government office buildings were rapidly constructed. The monuments of the Spanish era continued to stand proudly, while the future began to rise around them with triumphant vigor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the course of the Spanish colonial era, native design and European styles came together in an evolving synthesis that culminated in the stately architecture of churches and aristocratic houses in provincial towns. As Spanish words had been absorbed by the native languages, so had baroque, rococo, neoclassic, and Gothic revival motifs been absorbed by the Filipino&rsquo;s architectural vocabulary. That language continued to find utterance in upper-class residential architecture in the early decades of the American regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beginning of the new age was especially evident in Manila, where, as John Foreman (1905) reported, &ldquo;&hellip; works of general public utility were undertaken &hellip;the Luneta Esplanade &hellip; was reformed, the field of Bagumbayan &hellip; was drained; breaches were made in the city wall to facilitate the entry of American vehicles; new thoroughfares were opened; an iron bridge, commenced by the Spaniards, was completed; a new <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\">Town Hall</a>, a splendidly equipped Government Printing Office were built; an immense ice factory was erected on the south side of the river to meet the American demand for that luxury.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ice factory was the Insular Ice Plant and Cold Storage built ca 1902 by the Philippine Commission. It was a massive brick building with high and narrow blind arches on its facade that recalled the 19th-century neo-Romanesque style in the United States. The ice plant survived until the 1980s when it was demolished to give way to the elevated track of the light rail transit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those early years construction projects were undertaken by the engineers of the US Army. It is uncertain whether there was any architect among them, for in 1901 a Filipino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a>, was appointed consulting architect by the first American civil governor William Howard Taft. That same year the Philippine Commission created the Bureau of Architecture and Construction of Public Buildings under the Department of Instruction. Arellano, a locally trained <strong>maestro de obras</strong> (master builder), had served as an officer in the Engineer Corps of the Revolutionary Army. In later years he would design a number of notable houses and buildings in various <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">revivalist styles</a>, including the neo-Gothic, neo-Renaissance, and neobaroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the priorities of the American government was the development of a summer capital in a cool region. Thus in 1904 the American architect and city planner <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a> came to the Philippines upon the invitation of Commissioner William Cameron Forbes primarily to survey <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a>, and, to use Forbes&rsquo;s own words, &ldquo;try to lay out a new city and, in addition, to make some plans for the development of Manila.&rdquo; In the early years of his career Burnham belonged to the Chicago School that pioneered in modern architecture. He was the chief designer of the World&rsquo;s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893, and from then on was a zealous advocate of neoclassicism. As a city planner, he promoted the &ldquo;City Beautiful&rdquo; movement, and prepared plans for Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Washington DC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Baguio, Burnham proposed a general scheme for the street system, the location of buildings, and recreation areas. Although his plan was followed in principle, it was adapted by later architects who were entrusted with its implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Manila, Burnham prepared a more comprehensive and detailed proposal that aimed to develop the waterfront, parks, and parkways; the street system; building sites; waterways for transportation; and summer resorts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The bay front,&rdquo; he proposed, &ldquo;from the present Luneta southward should have a continuous parkway extending, in course of time, all the way to Cavite...The banks of the Pasig should be shaded drives beginning as close to town as possible and continuing up the river, the south bank drive going to Fort McKinley, and beyond this to the lake.&rdquo; Since what was the Luneta then would be occupied by a government center, a new Luneta would be built farther out on reclaimed land, and would &ldquo;give an unobstructed view of the sea.&rdquo; Nine parks were to be &ldquo;evenly distributed over the city&rdquo; and were to be connected by parkway boulevard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The street system in the districts would, for the most part, remain unchanged; the street system in areas to be developed would follow a radial pattern, while diagonal thoroughfares would link the city districts. Burnham recommended that building sites should avoid a rigid north-south or east-west orientation, so that houses would enjoy sunlight on all sides throughout the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government center, comprising the capitol and department buildings, would be erected south of the Walled City and near the bay. The courthouse, the post office, and cultural facilities would be on separate sites. Beside the bay, on a site north of the Luneta, a hotel would be built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The esteros or estuaries were to be developed and maintained as waterways. Summer resorts were to be established on higher elevations around Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charmed by the old houses with tile roofs and overhanging second stories, Burnham proposed that these be preserved, and recommended that new, simple, well-proportioned buildings of reinforced concrete follow the arcaded style of the old Spanish edifices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manila, Burnham remarked, &ldquo;possessed the bay of Naples, the winding river of Paris, and the canals of Venice.&rdquo; With his plan he proposed to &ldquo;make Manila what the Spaniards used to call it&mdash;the Pearl of the Orient.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the implementation of his plans for Manila and Baguio, Burnham recommended <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">William E. Parsons</a>, a product of Yale, Columbia, and the Paris Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Parsons served as consulting architect of the Bureau of Public Works from 1905 to 1914. In that short span he supervised the implementation of the Burnham plans for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Manila</a> and Baguio; prepared city plans for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/430\">Zamboanga</a>; directed the development of parks, plazas, and shoreline areas in many provinces; and designed a number of outstanding buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heeding Burnham&rsquo;s counsel on the design of buildings for Manila, Parsons evolved a style that was refreshingly modern yet unmistakably evocative of the local tradition. With pitched roofs, plain walls, wide arches, deep galleries, and <strong>capiz</strong> windows, the new buildings that Parsons created echoed the ambiance of Spanish colonial Manila, and at the same time enunciated the principle that form should follow function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An outstanding example of Parsons&rsquo;s approach to design is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), constructed in 1910, a building neoclassic in its disciplined elegance and highly practical in its loose and airy arrangement of pavilions. Parsons&rsquo;s other major works include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army-Navy Club</a>, the Elks Club, the Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association (YMCA) Building, the Normal School and the adjacent dormitory, later called Normal Hall. His works outside Manila include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\">provincial capitols</a> and their plazas, schoolhouses, and markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end of his service in the Philippines, Parsons designed the initial buildings of the University of the Philippines (UP), then on Taft Ave and Padre Faura. The first building, the University Hall, was in the neoclassic style, surrounded by porticoes with Ionic columns. In this and in works produced after his Philippine assignment, Parsons succumbed to the revivalism of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts from which he had been successfully freed in his earlier work. It was ironic that the architect who had introduced a new direction for Filipino architecture would reverse it by implanting the neoclassic style that would be the official architecture of the government for the next quarter of a century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first Filipino to receive the academic title of architect during the American regime was Carlos Barretto, who in 1903 was sent as a government&nbsp;<em>pensionado&nbsp;</em>or scholar to the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia. After graduating in 1907 he returned to the Philippines, and from 1908 to 1913 worked in the Division of Building Construction of the Bureau of Public Works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1911 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2702\">Antonio Toledo</a>, a product of Ohio State University and Cornell University, joined the Bureau of Public Works, and in 1928 became consulting architect of its Architectural Division, a post which he held until his retirement in 1954. Toledo assisted Parsons in the design of several buildings. In the 1920s Toledo designed the College of Medicine Annex and University Library of the UP, the Leyte Capitol, and, in the late 1930s, the City Hall of Manila, the Agriculture and Commerce (now National Museum of Natural History) Building and the Finance (now National Museum of Anthropology) Building. Toledo&rsquo;s works were all in the neoclassic vein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a> graduated from Cornell University in 1911, and worked as draftsman at the Bureau of Public Works from that year until 1915, when he went into private practice. Returning to the Bureau in 1918, he was named supervising architect and served in that position until 1927. Mapua designed the Nurses Home of the PGH, one of the finest examples of the neo-Renaissance style in the country. In 1925 he founded the Mapua Institute of Technology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An acknowledged master in his time was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, a younger brother of Arcadio. Juan Arellano studied at the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia, and after graduation travelled through several European countries. He returned to the US for further studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the Beaux-Arts School in New York. On returning to the Philippines he worked briefly with his brother Arcadio. One of their joint projects was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/305\">Gota de Leche</a> Building on Lepanto (now Sergio Loyola St). One of its prominent features was a neo-Renaissance arcade consisting of semicircular arches springing from columns, and decorated with medallions on the spandrels. In 1917 Juan Arellano joined the Bureau of Public Works. As supervising then consulting architect, he became a dominant figure in Philippine architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His first major work was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a>. Originally intended to house the public library, the building had been designed by Ralph H. Doane, a successor of Parsons at the Bureau of Public Works. Construction began in 1918. When it was decided that the building should be for the legislature, the revision of the plans was entrusted to Juan Arellano. The Legislative Building was completed in 1926 and was described by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5369\">A. V. H. Hartendorp</a>, editor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5589\"><strong><em>Philippine Education Magazine</em></strong></a>, as &ldquo;the most magnificent and impressive structure ever erected in the Philippines... dominantly Roman in architecture, but Greek in its grace, Renaissance in its wealth of ornament, modern in its freedom from academic restraint, and Oriental in its richness and color.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1931 Juan Arellano completed two of his greatest works: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Post Office Building</a>, a masterpiece of neoclassicism; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, a magnificently successful experiment in the romantic style, which Hartendorp described as &ldquo;modern expressionistic.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Post Office portico, with its 14 massive Ionic columns, is an overpowering presence that both welcomes and astonishes the visitor. Departing from the conventional rectangularity of neoclassic buildings, Juan Arellano flanked the main rectangular mass with semicircular blocks, thereby adding grace to strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exuberance characterizes the exterior of the Metropolitan Theater. Its festive spirit arises from the rich combination of color, sculpture, light from built-in lamps and the large illuminated window over its entrance, the lively play of receding and protruding flat and curved surfaces, and the insistent verticality of pinnacles. Two movements in architectural design are here noted: an obeisance to the West in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> ornament, and homage to the tropics in the batik patterns and various fruit and plant forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years after the completion of the Metropolitan Theater, Juan Arellano designed government buildings for Banaue, Ifugao, and Glan in Cotabato, and adopted regional architectural forms, such as posts with rat guards from Ifugao, protruding beam ends from Cotabato, and steep roofs from both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Juan Arellano brought neoclassicism in the Philippines to its summit, so did he masterfully open new avenues for architectural design, particularly romanticism and the recovery of native forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Parsons&rsquo;s last years at the Bureau of PublicWorks to the year before World War II, i.e., from 1913 to 1941, government buildings were designed in the neoclassic style. Among the last of these were the Agriculture and Commerce Building, the Finance Building, and the City Hall of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neoclassic architecture enjoyed nationwide visibility, for provincial capitols from north to south of the archipelago were built in that style, notably those of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/321\">Pangasinan</a>, Negros Occidental, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\">Leyte</a>. Following the guidelines set by Parsons in 1913, the provincial capitols and related structures were located in parks, away from population centers, &ldquo;in a position of dignity and retirement.&rdquo; The orderly arrangement of provincial government buildings was supposed to reflect the order in government itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The implantation of 20th-century neoclassicism in the Philippines was inevitable. Parsons had been trained in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, which actively promoted revivalist design, particularly neoclassicism. Barretto, Toledo, Mapua, and Juan Arellano were products of American schools that were under the lordly influence of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, which then enjoyed secure dominance even while modern architecture began to emerge as a revolutionary force that would eventually prevail.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The neoclassic style was appropriate during a colonial regime when the country was being prepared for independence. Since government buildings in the great capitals of the world were in that style, it seemed logical that a people who aspired for equality with free nations and powerful states should adopt the same style in all its grandeur for the seats of civil authority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The genesis of modern architecture in the Philippines covers a period of about 30 years, and involves an interrupted infancy and a shift from early loyalties. It begins with Parsons whose earlier works signified a departure from historical styles and embodied a new approach based on the primacy of function. But in his last works in Manila, Parsons turned to the Greek revival and established the local neoclassic regime in architecture, thereby nipping in the bud a development that he had auspiciously initiated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A departure towards a different direction appeared in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/359\">Uy-Chaco (now Philtrust) Bank Building</a> on Plaza Cervantes. Built in 1914, it was considered Manila&rsquo;s first skyscraper, and is probably Manila&rsquo;s first and last building in the art nouveau style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juan Arellano was a master of neoclassicism, but in the Metropolitan Theater and in his designs for government buildings in Ifugao and Cotabato, he signaled the break from historicist styles. In his later work, however, he returned to revivalist design. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, who returned from Paris in 1920, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo Sr</a>, who returned from Rome and Philadelphia in 1923, began working in revivalist styles, but by 1930 had produced some of the first modern buildings of Manila. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, who returned from the US and Paris in 1926, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>, who returned from London in 1932, were committed to modernism in architecture from the very start of their practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Ecole des Beaux-Arts of Paris was the source of the neoclassic style in the Philippines during the early American regime, so was the art deco exposition held in Paris in 1925 the source of early art deco architecture in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Art deco</a> was not a major influence on the development of modern architecture in Europe or the US. It did not advocate any revolutionary concepts of space or structure, or contribute to the emergence of new architectural forms. It was largely a decorative style, limited to surface ornaments of stylized motifs ranging from the curvilinear to the angular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art deco architecture in the Philippines was significant because it marked the rejection of the prevailing neoclassicism. While it rejected such Greco-Roman staples as columns, capitals, entablatures, arches, and pediments, it did not reject decoration as such but in fact adopted its own ornamental style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What differentiated modern or art deco architecture from the neoclassic was the simplified structure defined by posts, beams, walls, and windows. The structural scheme of a building was revealed to some extent on the exterior, and was emphasized with the discreet use of ornament. While the neoclassic building was massive, formal, faithful to the canons of traditional design, and endowed with solemn grandeur, the early modern building was visually light, less formal, liberated from academic historicism, and relatively cheerful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the neoclassic buildings were symbols of national dignity, the early modern buildings were symbols of economic progress. In style, neoclassic buildings looked back to the past, but the early modern buildings looked to the future. Neoclassic architecture was identified with the government, early modern architecture with private enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With progress attained through widespread education, expanded public services, improved transportation and communication, increased production and trade, and greater exposure to the West, new buildings had to be designed and constructed to satisfy emerging needs. Erected were commercial buildings, school buildings, hospitals, hotels, apartment buildings, and movie houses only modern architecture, with its freedom and freshness, could provide. Experiments with form could be successfully undertaken with the help of reinforced concrete, the wonder material of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luna de San Pedro, chief architect of the City of Manila from 1920 to 1924, designed the Legarda Elementary School on Lealtad St, in the French renaissance style. Within the 1920s he moved on to modernism and produced the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\">Perez-Samanillo Building</a> and, subsequently, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1429\">Crystal Arcade</a>. The Perez-Samanillo is a straightforward, no-nonsense office building, with a somewhat elaborate exterior that reflects its structural frame. Columns, beams, and exterior walls appear to have been kept down to minimum dimensions to maximize the expanse of windows and the natural illumination within.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before World War II, the Crystal Arcade was celebrated as Manila&rsquo;s most modern building. Its ground floor could be considered the forerunner of present-day shopping malls, i.e., a long gallery with mezzanines on both sides and skylights at the front and rear sections. The striking features of the exterior were the continuous bands of glass windows and plain concrete walls that gave the building both purity of line and bold simplicity. In both the Perez-Samanillo Building and the Crystal Arcade, Luna de San Pedro employed art deco forms in various ornaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1930 Ocampo Sr had designed a number of buildings that were highly regarded for being modern. The Paterno Building (now a building of the Far Eastern Air Transport, Inc. or FEATI University), located at the foot of Santa Cruz (now MacArthur) Bridge and completed in 1929, was notable for its unembarrassed simplicity and functional design. The Oriental Club was modern and had a proper touch of oriental character. The seven-story Cu Unjieng Building, that once stood on Escolta and Tomas Pinpin, was a &ldquo;skyscraper&rdquo; so well designed that the structure was its own adornment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of Ocampo Sr&rsquo;s most impressive works is the Central Seminary Building of the University of Santo Tomas (UST). E-shaped in plan with courtyards between the wings, the building has a long front with continuous balconies and large windows on the second and third floors. The horizontal movement of the balconies is broken by exposed columns, and more decisively, by the slightly projected central section over the entrance and two similarly projected end sections. Art deco ornaments accent the vertical thrust of these sections and dramatize the entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, after his studies in the US, Juan Nakpil went to Paris for further training and, while there, visited the art deco exposition, where he picked up new ideas on architectural treatment, indirect lighting, and furniture design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon returning to Manila in 1926 he was employed at the Bureau of Public Works, then from 1928 to 1930 worked with Luna de San Pedro. In 1930 he established his own practice. One of his earliest works, the Geronimo de los Reyes Building, replaced by the Soriano Building, at Plaza Cervantes in Manila, was in the art deco style. At about the same time he designed the neobaroque Quiapo Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juan Nakpil&rsquo;s other works before World War II include the Avenue Theater and Hotel Building and the Capitan Pepe Building on Rizal Ave, and the Quezon Institute Administration Building and Pavilions on Espa&ntilde;a extension (now E. Rodriguez Ave). With round columns, rounded corners, plain surfaces, continuous horizontal bands of walls and windows, and the minimum of ornament, these buildings belong to the streamlined style of art deco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While his predecessors in the local modern movement strove for correctness and elegance, Antonio aimed for boldness and vigor. His first work, the Ideal Theater (now replaced by another building) on Rizal Ave, Manila, built in 1933, was notable for its strong, rectangular masses and minimum decoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonio could afford to be daring. He was one architect who from early experience was familiar with the rich possibilities of materials and the practical side of construction. The main building of the Far Eastern University (FEU) on Quezon Blvd was another exercise in architectural virility. Boldly projecting piers at each end of the front support the dominant horizontal block that defines and shelters the wide expanse of the building. The interlocking of horizontal and vertical elements creates both movement and stability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A less visible but nonetheless significant work of Antonio is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5618\">Ramon Roces Publications</a> Building (then Guzman Institute of Electronics, now Eastern Telecommunications), on Soler and Calero Sts, Manila. Set on the odd-shaped peninsula of a city block, the building follows the form of the lot and capitalizes on its irregularity. The broken planes of the exterior come together in dynamic movement, heightened by a rounded corner on one side, and a protruding semi-cylindrical three-story window on another. Long strips of windows and corresponding strips of slab overhangs and projecting wall sections, which conceal lower openings for ventilation, give the building a strong horizontal character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the works of Luna de San Pedro, Antonio, Ocampo Sr, and Juan Nakpil, some other buildings in Manila of the same period are of historical importance.&nbsp;The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/394\">main building of the UST</a>, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2697\">Fr Roque Rua&ntilde;o, OP</a> and completed in 1927, is unique for its earthquake-proof construction. The structure consists of 24 separate sections with a slit of about one inch between them, which is filled with a soft material. The building being pre-cracked, so to speak, can sway with a tremor without its walls or floors suffering any damage. The concrete used in the walls is of such quality that it has needed neither plastering nor painting. It has been exposed since the building&rsquo;s completion and has successfully resisted the weather.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Rizal Memorial Sports Complex, built during the 1930s, is an accomplishment not only of its architects but also of the engineers who designed its cantilevered steel structures. The concrete portions of the building, where public entrances and administrative offices are located, are art deco in style. The front of the Coliseum consists of a high, flat wall flanked by undulating walls, and a cantilevered canopy over the portal. The Rizal Memorial Buildings were designed by architects of the Bureau of Public Works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jai-Alai Building on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Taft Ave</a>, completed in 1940, was designed by the American architects Walter C. Wurdeman and Welton D. Becket of Los Angeles, California. Massive walls with strip windows form a backdrop for the towering semi-cylindrical window set behind slender columns. The contrast between solidity and transparency and between flat walls and a fully curved window creates a surprisingly festive effect. The Jai-Alai Building is an example of the International Style as interpreted by California architects. Unfortunately, despite protests by heritage conservation groups and advocates, the building was demolished in 2000 to make way for the City of Manila&rsquo;s new Hall of Justice, which still remains unbuilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Times Theater on Quezon Blvd, completed in 1941, appears to have been inspired by the glossy architecture of the 1939 New York World&rsquo;s Fair. A pair of high, white undulating walls stand apart from each other against a higher wall of glass blocks. It is the last striking art deco statement of the decade that preceded the outbreak of World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the last days of World War II, the American liberation forces shelled and bombed Manila to drive out, if not annihilate, the remaining troops of the Japanese army. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> all the churches, except <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a>, and all the houses were gutted and shattered. The stately neoclassic buildings, such as the Legislative Building, the City Hall, the Agriculture and Commerce Building, the Finance Building, and the Post Office Building, became monumental ruins. World War II left Manila the second most devastated city in the world and the provincial centers suffered the same fate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within a year since the end of the war, on 4 Jul 1946, the Philippines was declared independent from the US but the ruins of war were still very much evident.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"forms\" name=\"forms\"></a>Forms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Residences</strong>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\"><strong>tsalet</strong></a> (chalet) was the typical dwelling in middle-class neighborhoods in the early decades of the 20th century. A two-story house with living quarters on the upper floor, or a one-story house elevated above the ground, the tsalet could be plain and simple or stylishly ornamented. An exterior stairway, which was single-flight, L- or T-shaped, led to the front porch that covered the entire width of the house or half of it. The interior was divided longitudinally with living room and dining room on one side, bedrooms on the other, and kitchen at the back. Although representing a change in house-form, it still had such traditional features as capiz windows, <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows), and <strong>calado</strong> (fretwork) panels over partitions. The need for more space led to the construction of two-story houses with living room, dining room, and kitchen on the first floor, and bedrooms on the second floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Low-cost urban housing was provided in the early 20th century by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong>accesoria</strong></a> (rowhouse) which had a row of contiguous two-story units, each with access to a common alley or the street. The units were rented by the occupants. An accesoria unit was one room wide, its width varying with the liberality of landlords. A living-dining room and kitchen were on the first floor, the bedrooms on the second floor. The kitchen opened to a small yard. To save on plumbing, the bathroom was located sometimes on the first floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upper-class houses built in the 1900s and 1910s followed the general form of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). The living quarters were on the upper floor. Bedrooms opened to the sala or living room. In some houses part of the sala projected beyond the rest of the facade, creating a sheltered entrance on the ground floor. While the house was covered by a hip roof, the projecting portion of the sala was crowned with a gable which carried the family monogram. The masonry walls on the ground floor were thinner than those of the bahay na bato and were pierced with rectangular windows. On the upper floor the windows resembled those of a bahay na bato with sliding shutters and with capiz or glass panels, <strong>ventanillas</strong> (small windows) on floor level, and fixed transom windows or fanlights over the window head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1917 Arcadio Arellano designed the Ariston Bautista Lin house in Quiapo around a set of Vienna sezession furniture. Architectural ornaments echoed the elegant <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art nouveau</a> lines of the chairs and tables, giving the house, which was in the bahay na bato style, a touch of novelty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One type of house in the 1920s had two stories, a front porch on the lower floor, and living quarters on both floors. Some houses had a front porch on both first and second stories. The sidings on both floors were of wood. The first floor was slightly raised above the ground, providing space for storage underneath.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of wealthy families built houses of reinforced concrete in a modified neoclassic style with a colonnaded veranda in front or on three sides, and on both first and second floors. An impressive example of reinforced concrete houses of the period is the Nelly Garden in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/420\">Iloilo City</a>, built in 1928.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1930s saw the development of the so-called Spanish-style house, which had tile roofs, balustraded balconies, salomonica columns, arched windows, lacy wrought-iron grilles, and a three-story tower in front. Living room, dining room, and kitchen were on the ground floor, and bedrooms on the upper floor. Some houses had a curved stairway dominating a two-story high hall. The Rafael Fernandez house on Arlegui St, Manila, designed by Luna de San Pedro, was in its original form a classic of this type. The house was renovated during the Marcos regime and was used by President Corazon Aquino as her official residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The art deco house made its appearance also in the 1930s. Like the Spanish-style house, it had a three-story tower, the roof of which was sometimes an observation deck. The roof over most of the structure was concealed by parapets, and in some sections was a concrete deck. Rounded corners, porthole windows, corner windows, and balconies with handrails were features apparently derived from ocean liners. A curved window, two stories high, was a dramatic feature. Walls were usually white and without ornament. However, the interplay of volumes made the building a visual delight. The Benigno Aquino&nbsp;Sr&nbsp;house on San Rafael St, San Miguel, Manila, designed by Fernando Ocampo Sr, is one of the few surviving examples of this style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ermita, a district favored by the foreign community, became the setting of apartment buildings in the 1920s and 1930s. The more fortunate of these were built along Dewey (now Roxas) Blvd, or just a block away from it. The multistory buildings, some hitting the maximum of 10 floors, had spacious units, and a magnificent view of the city and bay. The Admiral Apartments building (later Hotel) on Dewey Blvd, designed by Ocampo Sr, had touches of revivalist design. Unfortunately, it was demolished to make room for a new building. The Boulevard Alhambra (now Bel-Air Apartments), also on the Boulevard, designed by Antonio, was one of the stunningly modern buildings of the time. The Peralta Apartments on UN Ave is unique for its protective overhangs on every floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Government Office Buildings</strong>. These may be classified according to level: national, provincial, and city or municipal. On the national level, government office buildings include those serving the legislative, executive, and judicial branches; the various departments and bureaus under the executive branch; and other government institutions such as banks.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The provincial government office buildings are mainly the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\"><strong>kapitolyo</strong></a> (capitol), which house the governor&rsquo;s office, the offices of the provincial board, the courts, and other offices. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\">City halls</a> or municipal halls, like the provincial capitols, accommodate the three branches of the city or municipal government: the mayor&rsquo;s office, the city or town council, and the local courts. Local government buildings include the post office, the police station, and the fire station.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government buildings of the American colonial regime were designed and constructed in line with the policy of preparing the Filipino people for democratic self-government. Provincial capitols were built in the second decade of the 20th century: the Laguna capitol in 1912, the Sorsogon capitol in 1916, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/321\">Pangasinan capitol</a> in 1918. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a> in Manila was completed in 1926.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Executive Office in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a> was built in 1921. The Department of Finance and Department of Agriculture and Commerce buildings were completed in 1940. For many years after World War II, the Supreme Court occupied the Villamor Hall on Taft Ave, which had originally been the School of Fine Arts and the Conservatory of Music of the UP. Since 1991 the Supreme Court has been housed in the former Rizal Hall of the UP on Padre Faura St. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Post Office Building</a>, the most monumental of government office buildings, was completed in 1931. The City Hall of Manila, completed in 1940, was large enough then to accommodate not only the city departments, but also some national government offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Symmetrical in plan, formal in massing, with rooms along corridors or around courtyards, prewar government office buildings were in the neoclassic style, following the trend set by Parsons in 1913 in the University Hall of the UP. American and Filipino architects who succeeded him in his post as consulting architect of the Bureau of Public Works maintained it as the official style. Its last burst of glory is visible in the Agriculture and Finance Buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schools.</strong> Education was one of the priorities of American colonial policy in the Philippines. The public school system was developed, a teacher-training institute was organized, and the UP was established in the early years of the regime. Private education also flourished as Catholic, Protestant, and nonsectarian institutions were founded. The school buildings of the period include those of the public and private school system from the elementary to university level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Act 1801 of the National Assembly, called the Gabaldon Law after its author Isauro Gabaldon, the amount of one million pesos was allocated to the construction of elementary school buildings in barrios or villages throughout the country. Several types of schoolhouses were designed by Parsons, the consulting architect of the Bureau of Public Works. These one-story buildings, which were slightly elevated above the ground, had classrooms on one side of an open gallery. Features derived from indigenous architecture were the hip roof and swing-out window shutters with capiz panes. Many of these buildings still exist and are still called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\">Gabaldon schoolhouses</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Public high-school buildings, usually located in cities and provincial capitals, were much larger but followed the same plan of rooms along an open gallery. The gallery was in the neo-Renaissance style, with arches springing from columns and medallions on the spandrels or the space between arches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Normal School (now Philippine Normal University), a teacher-training institute, Parsons designed a three-story reinforced-concrete building in a style that was modern but with traditional touches. The tight fabric of the exterior wall is pierced by wide windows, each flanked by narrow windows. The continuous line of the hip roof is broken by curved gables. While solid in appearance, the building is characterized by a tropical airiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>University Hall, the first building in the Manila campus of the UP, was designed by Parsons in the neoclassic or Greek revival style. This established the pattern for the other university buildings which were the work of his successors at the Bureau of Public Works, among them, Toledo. For the UP School of Fine Arts and Conservatory of Music, Juan Arellano designed the neo-Renaissance Villamor Hall, notable for the Serlian or Palladian motif of its entrance, i.e., a three-part opening divided by columns with an arch on the wide central section, and niches with busts between the upper-story windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>School buildings are generally longitudinal in plan and therefore have long impressive facades. Wings may extend from the ends and sometimes the center of the main block to form an E or a shallow U or H plan. Some buildings could be quandragular, with a courtyard within or with two courtyards separated by a central block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luna de San Pedro designed the Legarda Elementary School, completed in 1922, in the French renaissance style, with a Mansard roof and dormer windows. The building may be described as a French chateau interpreted in wood and capiz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although floor plans followed a standard pattern, decorative styles were varied. De La Salle College (now University) is notable for its neat precise neoclassicism employing the Corinthian order. Centro Escolar University&rsquo;s main building is unique for its neo-Tudor style. Both were designed by Mapua. St Scholastica&rsquo;s College adopted the neo-Romanesque, and San Beda College revived the neo-Gothic that had been fashionable decades earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earthquake-proof main building of the UST is characterized by an austere majesty that recalls Spanish architecture. The Central Seminary Building is in the art deco style. The first building of the FEU, located along Quezon Blvd, is the country&rsquo;s first modern school building, evoking the vigorous style of the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Benitez Hall and Malcolm Hall, built in 1941 in the UP campus in Diliman, were designed by Juan Arellano in keeping with the traditional style of government architecture then. The postwar buildings, the Administration Building and University Library designed by Juan Nakpil, and the Palma Hall and Melchor Hall designed by Concio, all in the modern style, set the tone for the other buildings of UP Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospitals.</strong> The American colonial government&rsquo;s program to improve and expand health services included the construction of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>. The largest building erected in the first decade of the 20th century was the PGH. The plans, dated 1908 and 1909, show a building composed of several pavilions in parallel array. A front pavilion, housing the administration, leads to a central area where common facilities are located and from both sides of which pavilions branch out, separated by courtyards and connected by arcaded galleries. Each pavilion houses a department: medical, surgical, orthopedic, and maternity. One pavilion is devoted to private rooms. The provision for future expansion indicates space for five additional wings. The building is formal and symmetrical, the plan being somewhat like an organizational chart. The design is most appropriate for the tropics, since each wing is designed for maximum ventilation and protection from rain. In the PGH, Parsons introduced a style of modern architecture, functional in plan, and employing the traditional arch while minimizing surface ornament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since tuberculosis was then the fatal disease that claimed the most lives, it was inevitable that a sanatorium for tubercular patients would be built. The Quezon Institute, designed in the 1930s, a major work of Juan Nakpil, consisted of pavilions symmetrically arranged and liberally spaced out. The pavilions included paywards, and the teachers&rsquo; and children&rsquo;s pavilions. As in his building of the same period, Juan Nakpil employed the art deco style. A native touch appears in the pitched roof of the central building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Commercial Buildings</strong>.</strong> The term refers to buildings serving the needs of private enterprise, and thus includes office buildings, stores or shopping complexes, factories, and warehouses. Office buildings and stores are more significant as architecture and have been the harbingers of new concepts and styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commercial office buildings fall into two general types: first, those occupied exclusively or almost entirely by a corporation, such as a bank or an oil company; and second, those that are rented out to various offices, such as clinics, law firms, and small companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latter type, usually located on urban property, would have stores, bank branches, or restaurants on the ground floor, and office space on the upper floors. The high cost of urban land and the maximization of income from rent are significant factors in planning such buildings. A building occupies the space up to the property line, leaving only a minimal area for a light well or a small courtyard as may be required by government building regulations. Rentable space is further increased by providing several stories. With progress in structural design and building technology, the increased efficiency of elevators, and the ever escalating cost of urban land, vertical expansion was inevitable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Downtown commercial office buildings are often enclosed on three sides by neighboring buildings, leaving only the front for access and for natural illumination and ventilation. Some buildings may have both front and rear exposure, while hemmed in at the sides by ancient structures. Fortunate is the building on a corner lot or on a lot open on three sides. More fortunate is the building with a whole city block to itself. If the lot of a commercial office building is large enough, open space may be provided in front or on two, three, or all sides. The best-designed buildings are those surrounded by open space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The five-story <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/359\">Uy-Chaco Building</a> on Plaza Cervantes was called Manila&rsquo;s first skyscraper when it was inaugurated in 1914. Its undulating balconies and iron grilles mark it as art nouveau. Other buildings of the period are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/294\">El Hogar Building</a> and the First National City Bank (FNCB) Building on Muelle de Banco Nacional along the Pasig River. While El Hogar is airy and arcaded, has large glass windows, and employs a graceful adaptation of the renaissance style, the FNCB is solidly neoclassic, with Ionic columns dominating its facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\">Perez-Samanillo Building</a> on the Escolta, built ca 1930, is one of the early art deco buildings in the city. As in many commercial buildings occupying a corner lot, each corner is chamfered or beveled, thereby eliminating a right-angled edge and providing a narrow vertical face for architectural treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/288\">Crystal Arcade</a> was Manila&rsquo;s most modern building in the 1930s. Called Crystal Arcade because of its abundant use of glass for the skylight, long exterior windows, interior windows along its mall, and glass blocks on the floor of the mall to light the basement, the building was notable for other features, like the grand, cantilevered, curving stairway and underground parking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5618\">Ramon Roces Publications</a> Building (Eastern Telecommunications) on Soler and Calero Sts originally housed company offices and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/74/1564\">printing press</a>. With its asymmetrical design and its vigorous juxtaposition of forms-planes, blocks, curves, and a cylinder&mdash;it is an early example of the sculptural approach to architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Capitan Pepe Building on Azcarraga (now Recto) employs a streamlined version of art deco, i.e., with round columns, plain walls, large windows, and a rounded corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Capitan Luis Gonzaga Building at the corner of Rizal Ave and Carriedo stands out for its unusual sun-breaks: continuous horizontal slabs with staggered vertical fins that also serve as signboards for offices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clubhouses.</strong> The turn of the century and the decade that followed was an especially &ldquo;clubbable&rdquo; time. In 1898 American army and navy officers formed the Army-Navy Club and used as their clubhouse an old building in Intramuros. That same year, patriotic upper-class Filipinos organized El Club Filipino lndependiente, which was soon renamed Club Internacional to conceal its nationalist light. In 1906 it was renamed simply Club Filipino. In 1901 British residents founded the Manila Golf Club, which had its golf course in Caloocan. The Benevolent and Protective Order of the Elks or Elks Club was organized in 1902. The Baguio Country Club was founded in 1905, the Philippine Columbian Club in 1907, and the Manila Polo Club in 1950. The YMCA was established in Makati ca 1910. But there were older clubs already in existence: The Manila Jockey Club, founded 1867; the Manila Club (or British Club) in 1878, and the Manila Boat Club, an offshoot of the Manila Club, in 1895.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club facilities are generally the same, but certain features may vary. The standard facilities are social halls, lounges, dining rooms, game rooms, and club offices. Some clubs have lodgings for members and guests. Sports facilities depend on the type of club. These could include swimming pools, tennis courts,&nbsp;<em>pelota&nbsp;</em>courts, bowling alleys, and billiard rooms. Some clubs have libraries, and might even be well known for their collections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first clubhouses of the Baguio Country Club and the Manila Polo Club were built in the native style, i.e., with wooden frames, wooden sidings, an elevated floor, and a thatch roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army-Navy Club</a>, the Elks Club, and the YMCA, Parsons designed reinforced-concrete buildings which were among the first modern structures in the country. The Army-Navy Club has been gutted while the Elks Club is still standing. The YMCA Building, located on the block bounded by San Marcelino, Concepcion, and Arroceros, has been demolished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Army-Navy Club, located at the east end of the Luneta and built in 1908, is an H-shaped building, with two stories at the center, three stories on each side, and arcaded verandas on the first floor. Behind this building, connected to it by galleries, is a one-story pavilion that served for many years as a theater. Large windows bring in the breeze from the bay, while verandas protect the rooms from rain and the heat of the sun. With the roof concealed by parapets, the outline of the building is somewhat severe. However, the wings projecting towards the front visually beckon and lead the visitor into the sheltered entrance at the central block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1917 the Casino Espa&ntilde;ol inaugurated its new building on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Taft Ave</a>. The work of Arcadio and Juan Arellano, the clubhouse was in the neo-Renaissance style which the same architects employed in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/305\">Gota de Leche Building</a> on Lepanto St. Along its facade was a series of deep arches supported by pairs of columns. This building was destroyed in World War II. The new Casino was built in 1951 on San Luis St (now T. M. Kalaw), behind the old site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By far the largest clubhouse in its time was the University Club, at the corner of San Luis and Dewey (now Roxas) Blvd, built ca 1920. The seven-story building had accommodations for its members. After World War II it was converted into a hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1920s Juan Arellano designed the Manila Yacht Club on Dewey Blvd and the Wack-Wack Golf Club in Mandaluyong, Rizal, both of which, according to contemporary accounts, were in the Spanish colonial style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The clubhouse of the Manila Jockey Club on Felix Huertas St, built in the 1930s, was designed by Juan Nakpil. The four-story, art deco building has a semicylindrical facade with round columns flanking large, rectangular windows. On both sides of the facade are semicylindrical stairwells encased in glass, a daring feature at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hotels.</strong> In Burnham&rsquo;s &ldquo;Report on Proposed Improvements at Manila,&rdquo; written in 1905, he says: &ldquo;To the north of the Luneta park is a space approximately 500 to 600 ft. reserved for a hotel whose size, surroundings and appointments are intended to deliver Manila once and for all from the standing reproach of inhospitality toward a traveller. A hotel on a sufficient scale in this location could be made renowned the world over, and constitute in itself alone an attraction strong enough to draw to Manila every traveller in the Orient. With three sides fronting on parks and boulevards, and the fourth side fronting the sea, the hotel site offers every possibility for a world famous resort.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Burnham visited Manila in 1904, there were a number of hotels in the city, in Intramuros, on the Calle Real and in Binondo, at Plaza Calderon de la Barca, Plaza Cervantes, and the Escolta. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Hotel de Oriente</a> at Plaza Calderon de la Barca was considered Manila&rsquo;s best at the time. It was housed in an elegant two-story building with seven bays along its front. On the ground floor was a narrow arcade with Moorish arches, with the arch on the central bay rising to the top of the second floor. The windows and ventanillas on the lower floor were protected by iron grilles. There were windows also on the <strong>entresuelo</strong> (mezzanine). The windows on the upper floor had sliding glass shutters and ventanillas with iron grilles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burnham&rsquo;s proposal for a hotel fronting both park and bay became a reality in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, which Parsons designed. The hotel was built on the site chosen by Burnham, and its architectural style conformed with his recommendations: &ldquo;Flat walls, simply built of concrete (with steel reinforcing rods to resist earthquake), and depending for their effect upon beautiful proportions rather than upon costly materials, are from all points of view most desirable for Manila. The old Spanish buildings with their relatively small openings, their wide arched arcades and large wall spaces of flat whitewash possess endless charm, and as types of good architecture for tropical service, could hardly be improved upon.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old aerial photographs indicate that the Manila Hotel was originally an H-shaped building. In the course of the years, annexes were constructed, particularly on the side along the bay. A bayside annex was designed by Luna de San Pedro. The lobby was originally a long narrow concourse along the front. An elegant dining room at the bay side of the building became a spacious foyer for an annex, the vast Fiesta Pavilion. Like other buildings done by Parsons at the time, the Manila Hotel had capiz window shutters. With its incomparable location beside the bay, and its lawns, gardens, swimming pool, and ballrooms, the Manila Hotel became the country&rsquo;s first resort-hotel and was the only one for a long time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While other hotels were built during the American regime, they were in the nature of downtown hotels, built on urban lots of limited area. The Luneta Hotel on San Luis St (now T. M. Kalaw St) is said to have been built ca 1910. It is the only building in Manila in the French renaissance style, and must have been designed by an architect trained in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts tradition. The four-bay, six-story building is crowned by a pair of Mansard roofs. On the front, French windows open to balconies with cast-iron grilles. The balconies are supported by consoles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built before World War II, the Bay View Hotel at the corner of Dewey Blvd and Isaac Peral (now UN Ave) was one of the early high-rise buildings. A handsome structure of functional design, it abstained from the art deco ornaments of the period. The building has recently undergone major renovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Great Eastern Hotel on Echague St was a prewar high-rise downtown hotel. A survivor of the shelling in the last days of the war, it has been demolished to give way to new construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although presently a victim of neglect, the Avenue Hotel and Theater on Rizal Ave, built in 1938, stands as a fine example of art deco architecture. One of the tallest buildings at the time, it was notable not only for its height but also for its elegance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Theaters and Cinemas.</strong> Of the many <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a> built in the 19th century, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Circo Zorrilla</a> at Calzada de Iris (later Azcarraga and now Recto), inaugurated in 1893, was the only one that lasted well into the 20th century. It survived the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3296\">Teatro Filipino</a><strong> </strong>at Echague, built ca 1880, which was also the venue of&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a>&nbsp;</em>and concerts until the early 1900s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">Operas</a>, sarsuwela, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\">concerts</a> were performed at the Zorrilla. It was one of the stars of the golden age of the sarsuwela, but when motion pictures became the rage, the Zorrilla, like an old actor adapting to a new medium, became a cinema. The grand wooden building, celebrated as it was in its heyday, did not age well. In less than 40 years it deteriorated, and in 1936 was demolished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A younger competitor of the Zorrilla was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a>, built in 1902. In the opera house tradition, it had tiers of boxes around the main floor, above which was a dome. Italian and Russian opera companies, and later a Filipino opera company, performed in this theater. Here prima ballerina Anna Pavlova enthralled Manila with her &ldquo;Dying Swan.&rdquo; The Opera House is perhaps best remembered for having been the setting of the first Philippine Assembly in 1907. Burned in 1943, the building was rebuilt soon after the war, no longer with the tiers of boxes, but with the standard main floor, loge, and balcony of movie houses. From then on it was a cinema, but it also presented popular stage productions. The Opera House has since been demolished and on its site is a multistory, multipurpose building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The emergence of world-class Filipino opera singers in the 1920s, the founding of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4069\">Manila Symphony Orchestra</a> in 1925, and renewed interest in the theater enlivened the cultural scene in Manila and well justified the construction of a new theater in the grand manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juan Arellano, acknowledged master of the monumental, was commissioned to design the Metropolitan Theater which would be located at the Mehan Gardens, formerly the Campo de Arroceros where theaters stood in the 19th century. Departing from the neoclassic style for which he was celebrated, Arellano created a sumptuous yet eminently functional theater building that combined native motifs, art deco, and oriental opulence in its embellishments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building was surrounded by open space, and thus stood with regal prominence. The auditorium was flanked by two-story buildings, but separated from them by courtyards. A ballroom, offices, shops, and a restaurant were housed in these buildings. The theater, which accommodated 1,670, had a large stage equipped with flies. Although designed primarily for stage productions, the Metropolitan also exhibited movies. Destroyed in World War II, it was restored in 1978.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1930s saw the birth of the first-class <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">cinemas</a>, the work of major architects of the time. These first-run movie houses exhibited only American films. In the 1930s Antonio designed the Ideal Theater on Rizal Ave and the Lyric on the Escolta. Juan Nakpil designed the Capitol Theater on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>, and the State and Avenue on Rizal Ave. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\">Luis Araneta</a> designed the Times on Quezon Blvd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cinema houses of the period were in the art deco style and were considered a novelty for their use of indirect lighting. Decorative motifs in some theaters included the salakot, carabao heads, and tropical foliage. The lobbies had wide portals that opened directly to the street. On one or both sides of the entrance were the ticket booths. On the left and right walls of the lobby were display boards announcing the current and the coming shows. A few steps led down to the orchestra, and elegant stairways led up to the loge and balcony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the theaters were designed mainly for movies, they had stages of sufficient depth and sometimes had provisions for an orchestra pit. These stages were put to good use during World War II, when the importation of American movies was stopped and the operations of the Filipino film industry were suspended. Filipino movie actors, and directors formed companies and presented what were then billed as &ldquo;stage shows&rdquo; in the movie houses. Short enough to be performed several times a day, these included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1068\">comedy</a>, farce, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a>, and variety shows. Old American movies considered safe enough by the Japanese censors were shown between stage performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Churches.</strong> In the early years of the American colonial regime, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a> built during the Spanish period continued to serve the needs of the predominantly Catholic population. No new churches of architectural significance were built in the first two decades of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some old churches were improved or rebuilt following revivalist styles. The San Miguel Church, which had been rebuilt several times since it was constructed in 1835, was rebuilt in the neo-Romanesque style in 1913. In the 1920s Luna de San Pedro designed the neo-Romanesque Paules (Vincentian) Church at San Marcelino St, Paco, Manila. The neo-Gothic abbey church of Our Lady of Montserrat, also known as the San Beda Church, was designed by George Asp, an American architect. The paintings on the ceiling and walls are the work of a Spanish Benedictine monk, Lesmes Lopez OSB. The Paco Church, originally built in the 18th century and rebuilt several times, was rebuilt in the 1930s in the neoclassic style. The Quiapo Church, reconstructed in 1933, was designed by Juan Nakpil in the neobaroque style. These churches were academically correct but lacked the vigor and folksy originality of the more notable churches of the Spanish period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intramuros had seven churches, namely, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Cathedral</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a>, San Francisco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">San Ignacio</a>, Recoletos, and Lourdes, and several chapels. When all these, except San Agustin, were destroyed during World War II, the country lost some of its greatest historical treasures. The destruction of these buildings compelled the Catholic Church to build new ones although not in Intramuros, except for the rebuilt <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the arrival and spread of Protestant sects during the American period, Protestant churches were built in Manila and other major cities and towns in the country. The Episcopalians built the Cathedral of St. Mary and St. John on the corner of Isaac Peral (now United Nations Avenue) and Florida (now Maria Orosa Avenue). The Presbyterians built notable churches, mostly in the neo-Gothic style, like the Ellinwood Malate Church which was built, 1907; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/273\">Bradford Memorial Church</a> in Cebu, 1912; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> Church in Negros Oriental, 1916. After the founding of the Iglesia Filipino Independiente (IFI) in 1902 and the US colonial government&rsquo;s order for IFI to return to the Catholic Church all the churches IFI had occupied after the Philippine revolution, the IFI began to build its own places of worship in and outside Manila. Later, after the registration of the Iglesia ni Cristo as an organization in 1914, Felix Manalo held religious services for his growing congregations in modest chapels and churches before World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This era known as Peace Time came to an abrupt end when Japanese planes bombed Manila on 8 Dec 1941. All construction stopped; World War II had begun in the Pacific. During this short but harrowing period, the Second Republic (1942-45) was inaugurated with Jose P. Laurel as president of the government, perceived as a Japanese puppet. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

That same year the Philippine Commission created the Bureau of Architecture and Construction of Public Buildings under the Department of Instruction. Arellano, a locally trained <strong>maestro de obras</strong> (master builder), had served as an officer in the Engineer Corps of the Revolutionary Army.

In this and in works produced after his Philippine assignment, Parsons succumbed to the revivalism of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts from which he had been successfully freed in his earlier work.

The Oriental Club was modern and had a proper touch of oriental character. The seven-story Cu Unjieng Building, that once stood on Escolta and Tomas Pinpin, was a &#x201C;skyscraper&#x201D; so well designed that the structure was its own adornment."

The horizontal movement of the balconies is broken by exposed columns, and more decisively, by the slightly projected central section over the entrance and two similarly projected end sections. Art deco ornaments accent the vertical thrust of these sections and dramatize the entrance."

The main building of the Far Eastern University (FEU) on Quezon Blvd was another exercise in architectural virility. Boldly projecting piers at each end of the front support the dominant horizontal block that defines and shelters the wide expanse of the building. The interlocking of horizontal and vertical elements creates both movement and stability."

Set on the odd-shaped peninsula of a city block, the building follows the form of the lot and capitalizes on its irregularity. The broken planes of the exterior come together in dynamic movement, heightened by a rounded corner on one side, and a protruding semi-cylindrical three-story window on another. Long strips of windows and corresponding strips of slab overhangs and projecting wall sections, which conceal lower openings for ventilation, give the building a strong horizontal character."

The structure consists of 24 separate sections with a slit of about one inch between them, which is filled with a soft material. The building being pre-cracked, so to speak, can sway with a tremor without its walls or floors suffering any damage. The concrete used in the walls is of such quality that it has needed neither plastering nor painting. It has been exposed since the building&#x2019;s completion and has successfully resisted the weather."

The concrete portions of the building, where public entrances and administrative offices are located, are art deco in style. The front of the Coliseum consists of a high, flat wall flanked by undulating walls, and a cantilevered canopy over the portal. The Rizal Memorial Buildings were designed by architects of the Bureau of Public Works."

Becket of Los Angeles, California. Massive walls with strip windows form a backdrop for the towering semi-cylindrical window set behind slender columns. The contrast between solidity and transparency and between flat walls and a fully curved window creates a surprisingly festive effect. The Jai-Alai Building is an example of the International Style as interpreted by California architects. Unfortunately, despite protests by heritage conservation groups and advocates, the building was demolished in 2000 to make way for the City of Manila&#x2019;s new Hall of Justice, which still remains unbuilt."

It is the last striking art deco statement of the decade that preceded the outbreak of World War II."

A front pavilion, housing the administration, leads to a central area where common facilities are located and from both sides of which pavilions branch out, separated by courtyards and connected by arcaded galleries. Each pavilion houses a department: medical, surgical, orthopedic, and maternity. One pavilion is devoted to private rooms. The provision for future expansion indicates space for five additional wings. The building is formal and symmetrical, the plan being somewhat like an organizational chart. The design is most appropriate for the tropics, since each wing is designed for maximum ventilation and protection from rain. In the PGH, Parsons introduced a style of modern architecture, functional in plan, and employing the traditional arch while minimizing surface ornament."

The pavilions included paywards, and the teachers&#x2019; and children&#x2019;s pavilions. As in his building of the same period, Juan Nakpil employed the art deco style.

A tall flagpole flew the American flag and below waiting to be raised was the Philippine flag, designed during the Philippine Revolution against Spain. Weather was changeable. A slight shower dampened the hopes for a sunny day, but before noon, the sun came out and shone brightly. At noon, American High Commissioner William McNutt lowered the American flag while Pres Manuel A. Roxas raised the Philippine flag. Then, the weather turned foul; by the afternoon it was raining.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The era of the Third Republic began in 1946 with the declaration of Philippine independence from the United States. Immediately, the new republic faced the daunting task of rising from the devastation of World War II. Destruction was massive; along with its environs, Manila was the second most destroyed urban center in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reconstruction set the tone for the second half of the 1940s and the early half of the 1950s. After the war, all the public institutions, especially government, the Church, schools, businesses, transportation, communication, and power were challenged to rebuild. Reconstruction followed two paths. The first was to reconstruct what had been damaged during World War II&mdash;this may be called restoration. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">Restoration</a> involved returning to the past before the war and establishing continuity between the past and the present. The massive destruction, however, in both Manila and the provinces had another face. It opened opportunities for new development and the introduction of the emerging International Style. The second path was to begin new projects in areas where little had been built. This second path would gain ground toward the second half of the 1950s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Funds for reconstruction came partly from the war reparations from Japan and support from the United States, in the form of the Philippine Rehabilitation Act, sponsored by American senator Millard E. Tydings, which the United States Congress passed in Apr 1946. The Tydings Rehabilitation Act disbursed an initial $120 million for the rehabilitation of public buildings and infrastructure. The Philippines&rsquo;s Bureau of Public Works collaborated with an office set up by the United States, the Bureau of Public Roads. The rehabilitation act had conditions which bound the Philippines more closely with the US. Americans were given parity rights to develop and exploit the Philippines&rsquo; natural resources and run public utilities just like any Filipino citizen. The United States also built large military bases in the Philippines, notably at Subic, Zambales and at Clark Field in Angeles, Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The War Damage Rehabilitation Fund was set up to assess losses and distribute funds. It benefited both the public and the private sector. Funds were dispersed in the form of back pay for members of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), through which Americans and Filipinos engaged hand in hand in combat during World War II. Financial help was also given to strategic private institutions like schools, churches, and factories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With these funds, the newly established Philippine Republic had to prioritize the buildings it needed to function as government. Soon after the war, government buildings were reconstructed in accordance with their original plans, if funding allowed it. When funding was inadequate, the original plans were simplified as had been the case with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a> in Manila. The reconstruction phase lasted up to the 1950s. But these funds were not sufficient to address the damaged left by the war. When the Apostolic Delegate, William Piani, organized the Catholic Welfare Organization (CWO) to address the needs of the Catholic Church in the Philippines in the post-World War II era, the organization had to raise funds from private donors to support Church projects because war damage funds were insufficient. Later, the organization evolved to coordinate and organize Catholics in addressing educational, social welfare, religious, and spiritual issues under the bishops. Its constitution was approved by the Vatican on 28 Jun 1952 and in 1968, after Vatican II, it was reorganized as the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reconstruction also meant ad hoc, piecemeal solutions to address the urgent needs for housing, infrastructure, and sanitation that would bring the Philippines back to normalcy. However, some of these solutions would lay the ground for future problems, such as the rise of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\">informal settlements</a> in urban centers and migration to urban centers. Attendant problems of overpopulation of certain areas, inadequacy of road systems, increase of traffic, degradation of peace and order, and breakdown of social services plagued and continue to plague the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the government, some institutions, and private individuals opted to take the second path of opening new developments and building more modern structures away from the traditional urban centers to new areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most ambitious project and biggest government project was the conceptualization and construction of a new capital away from the original Burnham plan centered around Luneta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1946, a new capital which would veer away from the vestiges of the colonial past and proclaim publicly the Filipino character of the new republic was envisioned in Quezon City. A 7,627-hectare area was chosen near the La Mesa Reservoir to allow for future expansion and for wide roads that could accommodate thousands. Pres Roxas through Administrative Order No 5 of 23 Jul 1946 established the Capital Site Committee. The following year Filipino architects were sent abroad for a study tour of capitals in the United States and Central and South America. Brasilia was especially influential in shaping the imagination of the Filipino architects which included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2646\">Cesar Concio</a>, and engineer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2676\">Manuel Ma&ntilde;osa Jr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roxas&rsquo;s untimely death at Clark Field did not stop the pursuit of the project. Under his successor Elpidio Quirino, Republic Act No 333, enacted 17 Jul 1948, created Quezon City as the new capital city and for this, the Capital City Planning Commission was tasked with producing a master plan. The following year on 22 October, ground was broken at the highest point of the site, Constitution Hill, for the capitol building. An 11-story steel frame was built for the House of Representatives, designed by Felix Mendoza, but in 1960 construction stopped for lack of funds. The proposed Capital City remained dead on paper. On 24 Jun 1976, Presidential Decree No 940 reverted the capital to Manila and in 1978 the Batasang Pambansa, the unicameral legislature of the martial law years was inaugurated using the steel frame of the long abandoned capitol building in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan for a new capital fell within an established practice of more than three centuries where <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">town planning</a> and architecture were subsumed as part of the task of defining and projecting the state. The Spanish already harnessed the potential of planning when they built towns and cities according to the guidelines of the Laws of the Indies. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel Burnham</a>&rsquo;s master plans for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Manila</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a> and, later, the plans by the Bureau of Public Works for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a> defined the new center under American control. Now it was the turn of an independent Philippines to project its own image and vision through concrete and steel in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Planned Communities and Suburbia.</strong> Addressing the need for post-World War II housing, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">planned communities</a> arose in the municipalities and cities surrounding Manila. Both the private sector and government contributed to the development of these new projects. Such communities are called suburban or suburbia. But the terms are relational. Makati, Quezon City, and Pasay in the 1950s were suburbs of Manila. Now they are part of Metro Manila and communities referred to as suburban are in places like Valenzuela, Alabang,&nbsp;and Santa Rosa, Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of planned communities was not altogether new. In pre-World War II days, New Manila was opened as a residential area for the elite, where lot sizes were no smaller than 1,000 sqm and where property owners could buy lots as large as one hectare. New Manila was on an elevated area of Quezon City, filled with trees, many of them fruit trees. It was envisioned as a pleasant garden village for the privileged. In 1931, Ayala y Compa&ntilde;ia tranformed 930 ha of the Hacienda Makati into an integrated residential and business center under a 25-year plan. The elite residential area was known as Forbes Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Pres Manuel Quezon, the People&rsquo;s Homesite Corporation (PHC) was created on 13 Oct 1938. Its charter mandated that housing be developed for low-income families. Land of 1,600 ha was purchased from the Diliman estate owned by Do&ntilde;a Teresa Tuason at the price of five centavos a square meter. Two million pesos were appropriated for the project but in 1941, when World War II began, the project came to a standstill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Housing Corporation (NHC) was created in Sep 1945, and its first project came to be known as Heroes Hill in Quezon City. A 38.8-hectare-lot with a road network of five streets had 55 detached residences was made for the officials of the Philippine War Damage Commission and the Joint US Military Advisory Group (JUSMAG). NHC and PHC were merged on 9 Oct 1947 and became People&rsquo;s Homesite and Housing Corporation (PHHC). Under the leadership of Anselmo T. Alquinto, what came to be known as Projects were commenced. Alquinto was a graduate of Harvard in town planning and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscape architecture</a>, having been sent by the government as a&nbsp;<em>pensionado</em>&nbsp;or scholar before World War II. He designed the Projects as communities with low-cost <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\">bungalows</a>, mass-produced and partially pre-fabricated. These were built on large tracts of land in Quezon City. Project 1 in the Roxas District was completed in 1949. Project 2 in Quirino was completed in 1951. Then followed by Projects 3 and 4 near Aurora Blvd and Anonas, and 5, 6, 7, and 8 in other parts of Quezon City. Project 16 was built in Caloocan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, these communities were &ldquo;bedroom communities;&rdquo; that is, residents went home to sleep and then commuted to Manila where they worked or studied. An initial reluctance to transfer to the projects was common because Quezon City was perceived as far away and public transportation was inadequate. Although these new projects were far more agreeable places to live in because they were surrounded by greenbelts and had ample lots for residents to plant trees and gardens, still it was a task to travel to and from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that would change as the decades moved on. The University of the Philippines (UP), which had opened the Diliman Campus before World War II, expanded its facilities. The Ateneo de Manila did not rebuild in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> but transferred its elementary, secondary, and tertiary units to Loyola Heights, leaving in Ermita its School of Law and Graduate School. Maryknoll College soon moved in next door to Ateneo and in the late 1950s, the Araneta Center was established in Cubao, with its iconic building the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\">Araneta Coliseum</a> being completed in 1959. By the 1960s, Quezon City had all the trappings of a modern city and became the preferred residential area as business and retail moved away from the historical sites of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Private Sector Development.</strong>&nbsp;Ayala y Compa&ntilde;ia opened new villages first in Singalong, Manila right after World War II, then in Makati, where they followed a different scheme. The developer subdivided land, set aside an area for common amenities like a shopping mall or village clubhouse, but left the design and construction of the houses up to the owners subject to restrictions regarding height, percentage of the land that can be built and left as gardens, easement between the lot perimeter and the road and adjacent lots, even the minimum cost of construction. Thus, three Makati villages assumed a hierarchy. Prewar Forbes Park, which had a reputation as millionaires&rsquo; row had Dasmari&ntilde;as Village built beside it as an extension. Between 1952 and 1962, San Lorenzo and Bel-Air were developed for the middle class. San Miguel was originally intended for the employees of San Miguel Corporation. Urdaneta was developed as an upper- middle class village between San Lorenzo and Forbes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What differentiated post-World War II planned communities from earlier ones was that these communities provided space for public facilities like schools, clinics, markets, playgrounds, and business and retail area. In effect, they were being built as autonomous villages within the ambit of the urban center. Clubhouses and churches were built with the cooperation of the residents who organized themselves as village associations tasked with planning communal activities and building and maintaining common facilities. The association collected a yearly fee and had annual elections for officers following a constitution and bylaws crafted by the association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another privately initiated project was Philamlife Homes in Quezon City, a 600-unit housing project for middle-income families. It was an architectural highlight of the 1950s. The units, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2636\">Tomas Arguelles</a>, were the result of thorough research and scientific study. While the comfort of the occupants was the chief consideration, the architect saw to it that construction would be economical and could be rapidly undertaken. From one basic idea came three typical units, each of which allowed four variants, making a total of 12 different schemes. Although compact in plan, the units enjoyed natural ventilation and had provisions for expansion. Since the inauguration of the project more than 30 years ago, most of the houses have undergone a metamorphosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Philam and the Ayala Villages were surrounded by a perimeter wall and entrance was restricted by guarded gates. The gated community proliferated and quickly became a symbol of social status. It was, after all, better maintained and its residents kept secure. But the gated community also had a downside. It excluded many others and stood in contrast to the shantytowns that had grown as a result of World War II and persisted until the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As more residential villages were created, more roads had to be constructed made to link these new developments to the urban center feeder roads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Business Districts.</strong>&nbsp;Reconstruction after World War II, the development of Makati beginning in the 1950s, and the emergence of new architects led to more imaginative and adventurous approaches to the design of office buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first of Makati office buildings to exceed the old 30-meter limit on height, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/309\">Insular Life Building</a> curves grandly along the intersection of Ayala Ave and Paseo de Roxas and is veiled with sun-breaks. On the lower part of its facade is a bas-relief mural depicting aspects of Philippine life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ayala&rsquo;s development of a business and commericial area along Ayala Ave, Makati Ave, Paseo de Roxas, and Pasay Road in the 1960s spurred the transfer of many companies to Makati. In the lead were the Ayalas who had Insular Life and Bank of the Philippine Islands head offices in the Escolta transferred to Ayala Ave, Makati. Likewise, the development of government projects and residential villages in Quezon City spurred the transfer of business and retail to Quezon City, especially when Cubao was developed by the Araneta family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presently called Araneta Center, this 35-hectare property area was purchased in 1952 by entrepreneur and sugar magnate from Negros, J. Amado Araneta from the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). Bounded by Aurora Blvd to the north, P. Tuazon to the south, Gen Romulo Ave to the east, and Epifanio de los Santos Ave (EDSA, formerly Highway 54) to the west, the property included the Araneta family home, called &ldquo;Bahay na Puti&rdquo; (White House), and a planned commercial area. Anchoring the development was the construction of a two-story rental space along Aurora Blvd. But what spurred rapid development in this area was Araneta Coliseum, begun in 1957 and was completed in late 1959. Graduates of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/259\">Mapua Institute of Technology</a>, architect Dominador Lacson Lugtu and engineer Leonardo Onjunco Lugtu designed the coliseum. Its iconic dome was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">constructed</a> by assembling prefabricated arches that were bound together by a ring at the top. The roof structure rested on a solid drum of reinforced concrete and strong pillars anchored to the adobe substrate of Cubao. The coliseum became an iconic building in Quezon City. As sports and other forms of entertainment were held at the Coliseum, Cubao became a favorite destination and spurred development in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transfer to newer areas eventually led to the decline of Escolta and Binondo as vital players in the economy. By the 1970s, many buildings in these areas were either partially occupied or already abandoned which led to their deterioration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exploiting Reinforced Concrete.</strong>&nbsp;A better grasp of the possibilities of reinforced concrete led to the more extensive use of cantilevers, shell construction, and folded plate construction, and to a wider range of architectural forms. With pre-stressed concrete beams or post tensioning, vast interior spaces with no intervening posts could be created. Concrete was the material par excellence, not only for its strength but also for its plasticity. It enabled the architect to approach the task of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/254\">architectural design</a> not only as a planner but also as a sculptor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the strength assured by structural steel and steel bars, buildings could go beyond the height limit imposed by the building regulations. Until the 1950s the height of buildings was restricted by law to 30 m. Research on the ordinance revealed that the original reason for the limit was not earthquakes or the load-bearing strength of the soil, but the height that water could reach under natural pressure, made irrelevant by new technology. In 1960, Manila&rsquo;s Building Ordinance No 4131 was amended to permit the construction of buildings up to a height of 45 m. Thus began the race towards the sky a challenging adventure for the Filipino architect and his inseparable associate, the structural engineer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the contest of height came the contest of size. While condominiums and office buildings began to take pride in their height, shopping malls came to glory in sheer expanse, measured in hundreds of thousands of square meters. Notable amidst all these were the expansion and liberation of artistic or architectural imagination and its happy marriage with the increasingly sophisticated technology of construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The imaginative use of wood, stone, and concrete and the overall impression of strength in Antonio&rsquo;s Manila Polo Club, built in 1955, are persuasive indications of latter-day Filipinism. The circular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Chapel (now Church) of the Holy Sacrifice</a> of the UP, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a> and built in 1955, used thin-shell concrete construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Architectural Styles</strong>. The development of modern architecture in the Philippines, which had its beginnings with the introduction of art deco in the 1930s, entered a second phase after World War II, during the building boom of the reconstruction years, and during the emergence of a new generation of architects, a number of whom had been trained in the United States. Both Cesar Concio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2635\">Carlos Arguelles</a> had earned master&rsquo;s degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2680\">Angel Nakpil</a> had a master&rsquo;s degree from Harvard University, where he had been a disciple of Walter Gropius; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2672\">Alfredo Luz</a> held a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the University of California at Berkeley. One prestigious architect of this period who had no foreign training was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2660\">Gabriel Formoso</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The architecture of the 1950s was influenced by the International Style, which was characterized by asymmetric composition, bold rectangular forms, plain wall surfaces, clean lines, and large windows. The style was understood to be based also on the principle that form follows function. The style was to remain popular well into the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A characteristic feature of many buildings of this time was the brise-soleil, also called sunbreak or sunbreaker, a reinforced-concrete screen composed of vertical and horizontal fins which protected windows and interiors from the glare and heat of direct sunlight. The invention of this device is attributed to the French-Swiss architect Le Corbusier (Charles Edouard Jeanneret). Its popularity in the Philippines could have resulted from its successful application in the Ministry of Education and Health Building in Rio de Janeiro, designed by the Brazilian architects Lucio Costa and Oscar Niemeyer with Le Corbusier as consultant, which was completed in 1942. &nbsp;One of the first local buildings that used the brise-soleil was the Engineering and Architecture Building of the University of Santo Tomas (UST), designed by Julio Victor Rocha, then dean of the school of architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the use of reinforced concrete and structural steel, buildings could break out of the post-and-lintel pattern and employ more visually exciting features such as canopies over entrances, wide overhangs, spacious balconies, and stairways projecting daringly from walls of columns, appearing to float. Cantilevers, which create a sense of lightness, movement, and unimpeded space, would be used more frequently in the second phase of the development of modern architecture in the Philippines, and more stunningly in the succeeding phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Iconic Buildings and Filipinism</strong>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo Perez</a> (1994) speaks of a &ldquo;romantic strain&rdquo; that&nbsp;&ldquo;appears in Filipino architecture of various traditions and periods.&rdquo; What he meant was that Philippine architecture celebrates what is perceived and thought to be Filipino and this expresses itself in the infusion of ornament in a design.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term romanticism is problematic because it is not an architectural style. The term &ldquo;Filipinism&rdquo; is more appropriate for describing conscious attempt to give buildings a distinct Filipino look. The government was complicit in fostering this trend. One of the designs submitted for the new capitol at Quezon City came from Federico S. Ilustre, the consulting architect of the Bureau of Public Works. He designed a central tower based on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>&nbsp;<em>kalasag</em>&nbsp;or shield as the centerpiece for a pastiche of designs from domes to what was said to be Malayan architecture. This 1958 design was not built; it received a scathing commentary from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/257\">League of Philippine Architects</a> when an exhibit presenting the designs of the proposed new national capitol was mounted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This did not stop the Public Works from pursuing the vision of a Filipino architectural design. Its Division of Architecture wrote earlier in 1957: &ldquo;The architects and engineers in the Division of Architecture have collaborated and dedicated themselves to pursue an obsession in the search and creation of a distinguishing Filipino character in architecture as well as in the arts, born out of an emerging new culture blended with the touches and tone of the resurging past&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2668\">Lico</a> 2008, 390).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the pre-World War II era, Juan Arellano introduced Filipino motifs in his designs for city halls and government buildings in the Cordillera and Mindanao. Pursuing a direction initiated by his uncle Juan Arellano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2634\">Otilio Arellano</a> sought inspiration in such motifs as the salakot, the&nbsp;<strong>mandala</strong> or haystack, and the&nbsp;<strong>panolong</strong>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> protruding beam-end. Some of his contemporaries would later evoke the steep roofs,&nbsp;<strong>capiz</strong>&nbsp;windows, wooden panels, and stone walls of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). While the early modern buildings concealed the pitched roof and its gutters behind parapets to create the appearance of a flat roof, some later buildings would expose, if not dramatize, the pitched roof and thereby emphasize their tropical character. Examples are Sulo Hotel in Makati City and the first Max&rsquo;s Restaurant in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">main building</a> of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, completed in 1969, Leandro Locsin brings principles and form derived from vernacular architecture although abstracted in the massive, cantilevered, visually floating block of the facade and the sculptured space of the main lobby. Formoso&rsquo;s Asian Institute of Management (AIM) building is distinctively modern yet evocative of past styles. Built in 1970, with stonewalls and modern&nbsp;<strong>bandeja&nbsp;</strong>(traylike) panels, it evokes the bahay na bato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various currents converge and flow together in modern Filipino architecture: liberation from formalism; rediscovery of the native heritage; sense of history; sculptural approach to design; adventurousness and the willingness to experiment; focus on the symbolic and the expressive in architecture; the striving for warmth, vitality and richness, and commitment to the human being as the center of architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s, a strain of modern architecture was inspired by space age futurism. In 1959, Marcos de Guzman designed the residence of Artemio Reyes using the&nbsp;<strong>pateriform</strong> or the flying saucer shape. In the 1960s, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2673\">Ma&ntilde;osa Brothers</a> designed the house of Ignacio Arroyo located on a cliff&rsquo;s edge and overlooking Marikina in the same style. Its undulating roof and semi-circular balcony evoked an extraterrestrial vehicle. Also in the 1960s, Aida Cruz de Rosario designed a house in Baguio as an elevated octagon raised six meters above ground and lifted by arch support. Such shapes were popularly correlated to the home of Jetson&rsquo;s, a popular Hanna-Barbera space age cartoon aired on television beginning in 1962. The saucer shape persisted to the 1970s in circular revolving restaurants and view decks of buildings in Manila, Pasig, and Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"forms\" name=\"forms\"></a>Forms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dwellings and Residences.&nbsp;</strong>Despite the efforts of government and the private sector at ameliorating the dire need for adequate housing, the housing projects and the gated villages could only cater to the working and salaried class which could afford to pay the monthly amortization for these houses. By now, there were many in the cities who could not afford such homes. Displaced by World War II due to the destruction of their residence or lured by the prospects of work and the cultural and social amenities of the city, more and more of the population flocked to the urban centers from all regions of the country. With many of these migrants unable to find affordable and accessible housing, the phenomenon of shoddy informal dwellings housing the city&rsquo;s poor grew. Their residents were derided and called &ldquo;squatters&rdquo; because they occupied land which they did not own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These communities were characterized by makeshift houses called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\"><strong>barong-barong</strong></a>&nbsp;or shanties. The barong-barong represents the architecture of poverty. Built on public land, idle land, or land owned by others, along railroad tracks or near garbage dumps, along esteros or on riverbanks, along seawalls or under bridges, they form settlements ranging from 10 or 30 households to several hundreds or thousands. They may have only one room or several rooms, and one or more floors. Their floor area ranges from six to 30 sqm. They are generally constructed of discarded or recycled materials: rusty iron sheets, plywood, cardboard, sawali thatch, plastic sheets, mats, canvas, and just about anything that can serve as a roof and sidings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The floor may be raised a few steps above the ground, or it may be the ground itself, covered with plastic mats to protect the dwellers from dampness. The roof is usually of one slope. A larger structure may have a double-slope roof or a combination of one-slope roofs. It may have a window or two on only one side, if the house is too closely built to others, or windows on two or more sides, if the house is far enough from its neighbors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its sidings are patchwork of various materials. Posts, beams, rafters, and studs are put together hastily, whether with nails or lashing. Easily consumed by fire, knocked down by storms, washed away by floods, or demolished by eviction teams, the shanty just as easily rises from total collapse. Its fragile construction reveals both the native genius for improvisation and a certain fatalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those who could pay to build or buy new homes would often opt for the bungalow. After World War II, this sprawling one-story house, inspired by the bungalows or ranch houses of California, became fashionable. A terrace, open or roofed, replaced the porch. Large picture windows, sliding doors, and French doors brought the outdoors in. Whereas the house of earlier years opened to a front yard, the house of the motorized age shielded itself against the street and opened to landscaped lawns at the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later versions of this house had prominent roofs, recalling the bahay na bato, and wooden lattices similar to the frames of capiz windows, elegantly carved woodwork, and massive stone walls. With the rising cost of land and the reduced size of lots even in affluent areas, homeowners went back to building two-story houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/246\">one-and-a-half-story house</a>, which emerged after World War II, had one story on one side and two on the other. The one-story section was the living room and dining room; the second story section had bedrooms on the upper floor. The roof sloped down from the two-story section to the one-story section, giving the latter a high ceiling on its two-story side. Access to the bedrooms was through a balcony from which one could look down to the living room. One-and-a-half story houses did not always have this kind of roof; some types had separate roofs for the two-story and one-story sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The middle-class&nbsp;<strong>bungalow</strong> was far more modest than its upper-class counterpart. Instead of a fully enclosed garage, there was a carport which could function as a covered terrace. Depending on the size and shape of the lot, the house was compact in plan, or somewhat loose and open. The latter form was more conducive to cross ventilation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the bungalow and the one and a half-story house, especially those that adhered too closely or even copied an American model would in the long run prove to be incompatible with the Philippine setting. Because the first floor omitted the one meter or so elevation of the older pre-World War II <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\">tsalet</a>, the first floor which was raised only about a foot from the ground would flood during the rainy season and typhoons. The low pitch of the roof did not allow rain to fall quickly enough, causing rain to seep into the roof and enter the ceiling. Some houses omitted the space between roof and ceiling of the traditional house and opted for exposed beams with hardly a space between roof and ceiling. This made the interior warm, increasing the buildup of heat because of the widespread use of large windows covered with glass, an effective heat trap. The bungalow worked well if the house was surrounded by a generous garden planted with trees and shrubs that cut down the heat and light from the sun by serving as living sunbreaks. It also helped for it to be sited at an elevated place free from flooding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since some of the middle class enjoyed economic mobility, their houses would be remodeled or expanded whenever funds allowed. The facade would be improved and decorated, or a porch or rooms would be added, or in the case of one-story houses, a second floor would be built. The Filipino&rsquo;s concept of a house is not that of something fixed and immutable, but of something that could be improved, enlarged, or completely altered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the postwar period, the government built low-cost housing projects, such as Projects 2, 3, and 4 in Quezon City, adapting various plans based on the bungalow. These housing units were one-story structures, which were either detached or joined to others in duplexes or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">row houses</a>. Some were two stories. With low roofs, floors on ground level, and minimum space, the houses were unappealingly plain. The walls were of concrete hollow blocks and the roofs, of asbestos. Since asbestos did not transmit heat, ceilings were considered unnecessary. It was not well known then that asbestos sheds fibers that cause respiratory ailments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Government Office Buildings.</strong>&nbsp;In the period immediately after World War II, many government buildings, such as the Legislative Building and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Post Office Building</a>, were repaired or restored. These neoclassic buildings were rebuilt but with simplified plans because funds were inadequate. The freestanding columns that decorated the Legislative Building&rsquo;s facade was not completely rebuilt, only those at the corner bays. The post office coffered ceiling was simplified. In the provinces, government buildings were repaired or restored, such as the Negros and Iloilo Capitols, which the Japanese occupied and which survived the war fairly intact but had to be repaired. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio City Hall</a> had to be rebuilt but no longer in the Tudor style of pre-World War II but in a neoclassic style. The challenge for the government to rebuild was enormous and its success was partial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end of World War II marked the liberation of government office buildings from traditionalism. In the 1950s, new government buildings, however, experimented with modernism. Floor plans broke away from the formalism of historicist design, and such features as plain walls, large windows, and exposed columns and beams were adopted from the International Style. Sunbreaks and concrete screens were employed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas in the past only the Bureau of Public Works architects designed the government buildings in the post-World War II period, private practitioners were engaged to undertake some major projects. The Social Security System (SSS) Building in Quezon City was designed by Juan Nakpil. The National Library on T. M. Kalaw was the work of a consortium of architects called Hexagon Associates, including Formoso, Angel Nakpil, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2679\">Felipe Mendoza</a>. The Central Bank Buildings were designed by Formoso; the Development Bank in Makati and the Philippine National Bank on the Escolta were designed by Arguelles. The Batasang Pambansa Buildings in Quezon City were designed by Mendoza. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) Building at the reclamation area was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2695\">Jorge Ramos</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early decades of the 20th century, government office buildings were regarded as, among other things, symbols of authority. In the postwar years they aimed to be symbols of progress, of looking forward to the future. Embodying a certain freedom of design, they foreshadowed the increasing freedom and restlessness of a new age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schools.</strong> While some <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a> rehabilitated their pre-World War II buildings, like De La Salle, St&nbsp;Scholastica, and the UP in Manila, the post-World War II era saw the planning of schools with large campuses away from Manila to its outlying district or to the suburbs. In the pre-World War II days, schools like the UP, St&nbsp;Paul&rsquo;s, Assumption, St&nbsp;Scholastica, De La Salle, and the Ateneo had Manila campuses, but their sizes were limited, about 3 to 5 ha on average. The UST&rsquo;s Sampaloc campus at 10 ha was considered the largest in the era but it was dwarfed by the UP&rsquo;s Diliman Campus which was more than 100 ha. The large campuses were developed in the manner of American universities, like Stanford and Cornell, where the school campus was designed as a village consisting of school, common areas for shops, stores and canteens, sports facilities used during and after school hours, and housing for students and for faculty. The analogy between the new Philippine campuses with Stanford and Cornell is apt because both these American campuses were located in the suburbs, just as the new campuses were rising in Quezon City, at that time Manila&rsquo;s suburb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, the Ateneo decided not to rebuild at Intramuros or at Padre Faura, in contrast to St&nbsp;Paul&rsquo;s, Assumption, St&nbsp;Scholastica, and De La Salle which did. Instead, under Fr William Masterson, the rector of the school, a 135-hectare piece of property was acquired from the Tuason estate. The site chosen was a ridge overlooking Marikina Valley and at the boundary between Quezon City and Marikina. Working with Gines Rivera, who graduated with a degree in architecture and planning at MIT in Massachusettes, Masterson worked on a general plan for building, starting with the Ateneo Gym, which upon construction was used to house building materials that had to be transported all the way from Manila some 20 km west. The first buildings of Rivera for the College were in the International Style, inaugurated in 1951. Then followed the Grade School, 1954, and the High School, 1957. The plans for these two clusters of buildings took advantage of the generous amount of space available. Except for the chapels, the Grade School and High School buildings were one story and sprawled following the contour of the land. The one-story buildings were connected by wide covered corridors. The school surroundings were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscaped</a>. The new campus was named Loyola Heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II, UST added campus buildings to respond to the growing student population and interests in other subjects and discipline. More schools built branches in the suburbs of Manila, following the model of American campuses adapting popular and modernist trends for buildings, which were functional and straightforward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospitals.</strong> The largest construction project within a few years after World War II was the Veterans Memorial Hospital (now Medical Center), a sprawling two-story building with the front pavilions branching out at oblique rather than right angles. The hospital presides over vast grounds which have been developed into a golf course. A box-like structure with slab overhangs over the windows and parapets concealing the pitched roofs indicate the influence of the International Style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in the 1950s, the Children&rsquo;s Memorial Hospital (now Fe del Mundo Medical Center), located on Banaue St, Quezon City and designed by Concio, departed from the conventional plan consisting of wings or pavilions. All rooms were in one curving multistory block at the left side of the entrance, while at the right, in a low and compact block, were an auditorium and various common facilities. While the building exemplifies freedom of form in modern design, its shape was dictated by practical considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\">Luis Araneta</a>, the original Manila Doctors Hospital on UN Ave, completed in 1956, was notable for introducing elegance into hospital design. The lobby was dominated by a curved stairway set against a large curved window. Rooms were liberated from antiseptic white walls and sported cheerful or soothing colors. The hospital was entirely air-conditioned, which made it a novelty then. Jutting out on the right of the entrance was a restaurant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Makati Medical Center (MMC), Araneta&rsquo;s largest work, was built in 1965, and with its nine floors, was the tallest in its time. In a large rectangular block, the building was accented at one end by a cylindrical block housing operating rooms, the intensive care unit, the nursery, and private rooms. On the exterior are flat, horizontal strips that serve as sunshades. The MMC represents the high-rise trend in hospital design, which continued in such buildings as St Luke&rsquo;s Medical Center on E. Rodriguez Ave in Quezon City, Medical Center Manila on Gen Luna St, and the annex of the PGH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Commercial Buildings</strong>.</strong>&nbsp;With office buildings constructed away from the urban centers, sites could be more spacious and design would no longer be dictated by real estate considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since its introduction in the early 1950s, the brise-soleil has appeared in many variations. Vertical fins are set close together and the number of horizontal fins is minimized, as in Alfredo Luz&rsquo;s World Health Organization Building on Taft Ave and United Nations Ave. In Alfredo Luz&rsquo;s Ermita Center on Roxas Blvd, horizontal bands replace the horizontal fins as braces and thereby give the building stronger horizontal lines. In Concio&rsquo;s Insular Life Building on Ayala Ave and Paseo de Roxas, narrow vertical fins are set close together within well-defined squares. In a number of sunbreaks, the horizontal fins are slanted to form giant louvers. For the Capitan Luis Gonzaga Building on Rizal Ave and Carriedo, Antonio designed double sunshades, i.e., concrete slab overhangs at both ceiling height and windowsill height for each floor, braced by staggered vertical fins of half-story height. The double sunshades are effective protection against both sunlight and rain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sunbreaks became necessary because wider and higher glass windows had become the fashion, courtesy of the International Style. On the other hand, they intimated that the Filipino architect was seriously concerned with solving the problem of tropical sunlight. Such concern was not always matched by results since faulty orientation often made the sunbreaks ineffective and nothing more than useless and costly ornaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Press Club (NPC) Building on Magallanes Drive, designed by Angel E. Nakpil, is one of the outstanding buildings of the period as it exemplifies the influence of the International Style on Philippine architecture after World War II. The NPC&rsquo;s concrete and glass structure with its expanse of windows and its neat, straightforward structure give it an engaging transparency, a certain cheerfulness, and a virile leanness. There is nothing extraneous in the design. Since the building is on an east-west axis, it avails of maximum exposure to both north and south. That transparency becomes daring in the glass-sheathed cylindrical staircase and elevator shaft, the building&rsquo;s distinctive and once controversial feature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Likewise significant is Arguelles&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/358\">Philamlife Homes Office Building</a> on UN Ave, a long rectangular seven-story block housing offices, with a one-story section housing a spacious lobby and a 780-seat auditorium, built in 1961. The building is a glass box in the International Style but with tropical adaptations. The gray-tinted, antiglare, heat-absorbing glass curtain wall enveloping the building is shielded from sun and rain by horizontal aluminum sun-baffles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pierced screen was the celebrated feature of the US Embassy Building in New Delhi, India, designed by the American Architect Edward D. Stone and completed in 1958. Not long after, the pierced screen was introduced in Manila and adopted as a kind of improvement over the brise-soleil. The device, which covers an entire side or several sides of a building, is a perforated wall which reduces and diffuses the natural light entering the building. Pierced screens were made of perforated concrete or ceramic blocks, precast concrete, or thick aluminum bars. The most notable pierced screen in Manila is that of the US Embassy Building on Roxas Blvd, designed by the American architect Alfred L. Aydelott and built in 1961.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/365\">Magsaysay Memorial Building</a> and the Ermita Center, both on Roxas Blvd, are basically office towers with lower buildings attached. The strong vertical component is balanced by a horizontal one that also serves to anchor it visually to the ground. The Meralco Building (also called Lopez Building) on Ortigas Ave in Pasig has a curved, concave facade, the consequence of a curved interior space so designed to avoid the train-like effect of long corridors. Behind the building, on a block of its own, is the Meralco Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Central air-conditioning and artificial lighting have been major factors in the design of office buildings, and of other buildings as well. No longer is provision made for either natural ventilation or natural illumination, as in pre-World War II and early post-World War II buildings, since urban pollution rules out the former. Thus architects have been encouraged to design towering glass facades that are unembarrassed imitations of the slick-tech architecture of the US. Some office buildings are costly attempts at First-World architecture in a Third-World setting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stores, Superstores, and Malls.</strong> For maximum access, stores are traditionally located on ground level. In an urban setting, they usually occupy the ground floor of buildings that contain offices or apartments on their upper stories. Stores that sell a variety of goods are sometimes called bazaars. In the Philippines, stores that completely occupied multistory buildings developed in the early 20th century. Such stores, called department stores, sell a wide variety of merchandise including clothing, home appliances, furniture, dinnerware, cosmetics, jewelry, and toys. They are overseas offsprings of the American department store. Notable department stores were the COD department store in Cubao and the Good Earth Emporium in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While foodstuffs, such as fresh meat, fish, and vegetables, were sold in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">markets</a>, imported items such as canned goods, fresh fruits, butter, cheese, and frozen meat were sold in groceries and cold stores prior to World War II. The post-World War II groceries expanded to what came to be called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">supermarkets</a>, one of the earliest and largest of which is Unimart in Greenhills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rustan&rsquo;s in Makati, which combined the department store and the supermarket in one building, initiated the superstore trend. Superstore buildings that followed include those of Shoemart (SM) and Landmark in Makati, Rustan&rsquo;s in Cubao, Plaza Fair on Plaza Lacson in Manila, and Isetann in Manila and in Cubao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Makati, Quezon City, and Manila, stores were grouped in arcades and malls which developed from one-story clusters to multistory buildings. Shopping malls now contain not only shops and supermarkets, but also restaurants, amusement centers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">movie houses</a>, and complete department stores, and are adjoined by multilevel parking buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clubhouses.</strong> The Manila Polo Club in Makati, designed by Antonio, was completed in 1950 and set the style for future clubhouses. The abundant space, the openness to the outdoors, the soaring hip roof, rugged stonework, and hefty woodwork came together to symbolize the vigor, daring, and sense of liberation associated with sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Valley Golf Club in Victoria Valley, Antipolo, Rizal, designed by Formoso, was completed in 1960. The floor plan combines a circle and a triangle, i.e., a golf ball resting on a tee. In the Club Filipino in Greenhills, built in 1970, Formoso underscores the Filipino character of the Club by simulating the bahay na bato. A hip roof, capiz windows, ventanillas, and stonewalls recall the Club&rsquo;s first home on Calle Alix (now Legarda) in 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hotels.&nbsp;</strong>Within the decade after World War II the first-class hotels included the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, the Bay View Hotel, the Hotel Filipinas, the Shelborne Arms Hotel, and the former University Club Building, all of which were along Dewey Blvd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Manila Hotel at this time set the pattern for future hotels of its category. Aside from offering deluxe accommodations, the hotel had a variety of restaurants, a ballroom, function rooms, a bar and lounge, a shopping arcade, and recreational facilities such as a swimming pool and gym. The hotel had all the elements of a vacation resort, a convention center, a social center, and a tourist attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With tourist traffic swelling to an unprecedented scale, more hotels were built not only along Manila Bay and in the Manila tourist belt, but also in Makati, and in such tourist venues as Baguio, Cebu, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/420\">Iloilo</a>, Legazpi, Davao, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/430\">Zamboanga</a>. At present Metro Manila continues to have the most hotels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hotels along Roxas Blvd now include the Hotel Otani (formerly Shelborne); the Bay View Hotel; the Hotel Aurelio (formerly Filipinas Hotel); the Admiral Hotel (formerly Admiral Apartmen<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong>t</strong></a>s); the Silahis International Hotel; the Holiday Inn; the Diamond Hotel; and the Hyatt Regency. On the reclamation area is the Westin Philippine Plaza Hotel (now Sofitel).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major architects who designed hotels in the post-World War II period include Arguelles, Formoso, Locsin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2707\">Villarosa</a>, and Juan Nakpil. The postwar hotels represent major developments in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/254\">design</a>, construction, and technology, particularly with respect to structural design, prefabrication, air-conditioning, and fire protection. Aside from the battery of engineers and technical consultants, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/215\">interior designers</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscape architects</a> have been the architect&rsquo;s indispensable assistants in creating not only the landmarks but the pleasure domes of this age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Churches.</strong>&nbsp;Immediately after the war, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">reconstruction</a> of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, convents, religious houses, Church-run schools, orphanages, hospitals, and other institutions was a concern of the Catholic bishops in the Philippines. It would take decades to rebuild what war had destroyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A major project was the rebuilding of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> from 1954 to 1958. Begun under Arch Rufino Santos, the project was placed under the supervision of the architect for the reconstruction, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo Sr</a>, who preserved the remaining neo-Romanesque facade and restored the church exterior in the same style. A new bell tower was built. He was assisted by a team of Filipino and Italian artists and artisans, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a>, who designed the stained glass windows in the idiom of modern Filipino painting, which Ocampo supported and promoted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the design team kept true to the original exterior of the cathedral, preserving as much as had survived the war, the interior, which had been gutted, was redesigned by the design team to allude to the past but not to slavishly copy it. The central aisle flanked by a colonnade was rebuilt but the interior spaces were planned and decorated in a manner that brought the cathedral up to modern standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other dioceses also launched reconstruction projects to repair damaged churches and&nbsp;<strong>conventos</strong>. While some places like Bohol and southern Cebu were spared from damage, the churches of Cagayan Valley were all bombed in 1945. The churches of Panay were also damaged. At the end of World War II, these churches were shells with interiors gutted, wooden retablos burnt, and all nave and sanctuary furnishing damaged. With great effort, churches like Capiz (Roxas City) were reconstructed. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao</a>&rsquo;s interior was still provisional until 1993 when its church was inscribed in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">World Heritage List</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many churches that once marked Intramuros were rebuilt outside Intramuros after the war. The 1890s Lourdes Church in Intramuros was rebuilt by the Capuchins, with a new facade and a neo-romanesque interior, in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two pioneers in modernist church architecture were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/396\">Chapel of St Joseph the Worker</a> in Victorias, Negros Occidental and the Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice in UP Diliman. After its completion in 1949, the Chapel of St Joseph was featured in&nbsp;<strong><em>Life Magazine</em></strong>&nbsp;and called the first modern church in the Philippines. The chapel was designed by an American firm, Raymond and Rado. Antonio Raymond was a disciple of Frank Lloyd Wright. At the sanctuary was an apocalyptic mural by Alfonso Ossorio, depicting the Blessed Trinity and the Last Judgment. On the facade and in the baptistry were glass mosaic murals by Ade de Bethune. The wooden images of Christ, Mary, and Joseph were the work of a local artist, Benjamin Valenciano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin&rsquo;s dome-shaped Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice, 1955, adopted the central plan to bring the congregation closer to the altar. The 24-centimeter-thick concrete dome rests on a ring beam, which is supported by 32 columns that follow the curvature of the dome. Wide openings on all sides make the interior accessible from any direction. On the walls between the openings are the Stations of the Cross painted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>. Adorning the floor of the aisles is the River of Life by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\">Arturo Luz</a>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2168\">crucifix</a>, with the crucified Christ on one side and the Risen Christ on the other, is the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>. Crowning the dome is a round skylight pierced by a triangular space-frame whose upper, outer section is a bell tower. From the pointed inner end hangs the Abueva crucifix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Intramuros, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a> was relocated to Quezon City and was completed in 1954. It was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2708\">Jose Zaragoza</a> in a style he called &ldquo;Spanish moderne,&rdquo; a modernized mission style on a gigantic scale. The murals at the crossing tower were painted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a>. These depict events in the life of St Dominic. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3559\">Antonio Garcia Llamas</a> painted the four evangelists, and Galo B. Ocampo designed the stained glass windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Baclaran, designed by Concio and built in the 1950s, had a modern facade that echoed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Romanesque</a> design with its repetitive rhythm of Roman arches and a ceiling that evoked the ribbed vaulting of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Gothic</a> architecture, although it used a semicircular arch rather than the pointed or lancet Gothic arch. Large doors on both sides of the building were conducive to cross ventilation and turned the outdoors into an extension of the church for the overflow congregation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christ the King Seminary Chapel on E. Rodriguez Ave, Quezon City was built in 1959. The floor plan was fan-shaped with an apse. Behind the altar table was a large stained glass window. Tall, narrow windows lighted the interior. On both sides of the choir loft were two tiers of balconies. Designed in Germany for the SVD Fathers, the facade had an expressionist monumental statue of Jesus at the last judgment and angels blowing horns to awaken the dead. Wrought iron rather than stone spires served as decorative finials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another notable church designed by Locsin was the Church of St Andrew in Bel-Air Village, Makati, which was completed in 1968. The basic structure is fittingly the X-shaped cross of St Andrew, from which emanates a billowing roof and a butterfly-shaped floor plan. The roof rested on deep arches, which are the entrances to the church. The baptismal font located at the entrance signified that one entered the Church through the sacrament of baptism. Inside and out, the church exemplified architecture as sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 20th century, churches of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/209\">Spanish colonial period</a> were in many instances kept as they were, with at most minor repairs. Some churches that were damaged during World War II, on the other hand, were mindlessly restored and renovated. The entire nave would be demolished and replaced with a new structure or, if the old structure was preserved, windows were enlarged by chopping off sections of the old walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The impetus for this heavy-handed renovation was the need to find quick solutions to making historic churches useful. But there was another impetus. In 1965, the Second Vatican Council was concluded in Rome. The council had set the Catholic Church on a path of reform and an influential reform was that of the renewal of the Church&rsquo;s rites or liturgy. Wanting to make the liturgy more accessible, the rites were translated into the vernacular languages. The biggest change happened in the celebration of the Mass. Where before the priest faced the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a>, in the reform the priest faced the people and entered into a common worship with them marked by a ritualized dialogue between priest and people. Although the full impact of the liturgical reforms did not happen until the 1970s when the reformed Mass text, popularly known as the Missal of Paul VI, was promulgated, liturgical reform began shortly after the council. Some priests had existing altar rails demolished to break the barrier between priest and people and had statues removed from the churches. Vatican II reform did not call for a wholesale restructuring of worship space; in fact, it called for the preservation of historic structures. But an iconoclastic streak infected priests, especially newly ordained ones and those who had studied abroad. They began remodeling historic churches, leading to a loss of church art and artifacts that fed a very active antiques market. Since the post World War II days, there had been an increasing interest in ecclesiastical antique objects. From the 1950s onwards, many of the old churches lost their statues, retablo, altar frontal, sanctuary lamps, and silver ornaments to art collectors and antique dealers. With a growing interest in sacred art, church robberies had become common.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reaction to such cultural losses came late, as well as the awareness of the need for better researched and historically founded restoration. Thus, restoration efforts have had varying results. The Las Pi&ntilde;as Church, famous for its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2095\">bamboo</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/820\">organ</a>, counts among the very few examples of proper restoration. In many old churches, the plaster finish was scraped off to expose the brick or adobe walls. This resulted in exposing the material to the elements and to possible deterioration. Water seeping into the walls could eventually damage them. Seeds that get embedded in crevices and joints grow into shrubs whose roots could dislodge stones and bricks from their stable alignment. Equally disastrous has been the application of cement to smoothen the soft lime plastering of the colonial church. This layer is an effective barrier against moisture but while it keeps out the damp from rainfall, it cannot prevent moisture from seeping from the ground to the stones. Without a way for moisture to evaporate because of the cement skin, it condenses and causes the stones to deteriorate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With few exceptions, Catholic church architecture in the Philippines in the 20th century, especially in the post World War II period, has consisted of serviceable, conventional buildings, some aspiring for originality, and some obviously lacking in inspiration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Protestant churches had their own path of development. Protestant missionaries began to evangelize in the Philippines in 1898 and soon after started to build churches. Like the first Catholic churches in the Philippines, the earliest Protestant churches were of nipa, bamboo, and wood. Later buildings were made of reinforced concrete. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Gothic-revival</a> style and motifs appeared in both small and large churches. Doors and windows took the form of lancet arches. In larger churches rose windows adorned the facades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ellinwood Malate Church, built in 1932, is one of the older buildings in the neo-Gothic style. The Central United Methodist Church on T. M. Kalaw, founded in 1899, built its first chapel in 1901. The present church, built in 1949, has a large recessed Gothic window in its gabled facade and is a restoration of the pre-World War II church designed by Juan Arellano. Other Protestant churches in the neo-Gothic style are the Knox Memorial Church on Rizal Ave, and the United Church of Manila on Recto St.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The neo-Gothic style, the architecture of the Romantic period, developed in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, and continued to be employed in the Philippines in the early 20th. Since most Catholic churches in the Philippines were in revivalist styles derived from Graeco-Roman architecture, the neo-Gothic style became the identifying mark of Protestant churches. By midcentury the Protestant churches turned to new forms. For the Protestant church in UP, Diliman, Quezon City, Concio designed a saddle-shaped building with a parabolic roof. Windows are cut into the lower slopes of the roof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cathedral of St Mary and St John of the Philippine Episcopal Church, located on E. Rodriguez Ave, Quezon City, was designed by American architect and missionary John Van Wie Bergamini, and was completed in 1960. The tower, which rises over the chancel or sanctuary, is capped by a four-tiered stepped pyramid. Over the glass jalousies on both sides of the nave are three horizontal rows of capiz windows on square frames. The interior design combines dignity with a tropical openness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine Independent Church, popularly called &ldquo;Aglipayan&rdquo; after its founder Gregorio Aglipay, took over a number of Catholic churches during the Philippine Revolution, but was compelled by a US Supreme Court decision to return them. The Aglipayans built churches of bamboo, then later of wood. Since their rites were derived from the Catholic religion, their churches resembled the Catholic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cathedral of the Holy Child, the National Cathedral of the Philippine Independent Church located on Taft Ave, Manila was designed by Arguelles and built in 1969. The building has a rectangular nave and a rectangular apse with an east window. The baptistry is at the entrance. Aside from the choir loft, there are side balconies. The exterior consists of an upper block with sloping trapezoidal walls, resting on a rectangular block. The sides of the upper block project beyond the walls of the lower block to form wide overhangs. On the roof, running above the central aisle, is a row of concrete vertical fins set apart from each other, probably intended as baffles for the skylight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) call their churches&nbsp;<strong>kapilya</strong>&nbsp;or<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">sambahan</a></strong>. The earliest of these were made of wood. The first concrete INC church, located on Washington (now A. Maceda) St, Sampaloc, Manila, was designed by Rufino Antonio and completed in 1948. It incorporated Gothic arches and spires that later developed into the identifying marks of the INC churches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juan Nakpil designed the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace and Chapel, located in San Juan, Rizal and completed in 1952. The kapilya in Cubao, Quezon City, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2698\">Carlos Santos-Viola</a> and Alfredo Luz, then partners, was built in 1954. After Santos-Viola established his own firm, he was commissioned to design most of the larger kapilya. In 1971 the INC organized its Engineering and Construction Department (INCECD), which undertakes the design, construction, and maintenance of INC buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The INC churches have been described as neo-Gothic. However, since neo-Gothic refers to a particular style closely imitating Gothic architecture or employing Gothic motifs, the term does not seem appropriate, for the INC churches are, in fact, in more of a modernized neo-Gothic style. The pointed arch, the triangular arch, towers and spires, and tracery on walls are the mark of the INC style. Other decorative motifs are rosettes and interlocking trapezoids. Sambahan of the 21st century have adapted lines, motifs and decorations from the baroque and Romanesque. More recent sambahan use less pointed arches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The INC style may be considered as having traditional elements, since it is derived from Gothic motifs; contemporary, since it pursues the modernist approach of simplification; and distinctively Filipino, since nowhere else in the world is it encountered. The architectural style is symbolic of the religion which, while based on the Bible, departs from traditional doctrine and is rooted in Filipino values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A program of extensive and simultaneous construction of meeting houses throughout the country has given the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Day Saints extraordinary prominence in a relatively short time. The majestically modern Manila Mormon Temple at Greenmeadows, Quezon City, designed by Felipe Mendoza, has a steep roof and monumental spires. Meeting houses in various parts of the country, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2650\">Cresenciano de Castro</a>, are characterized by gable roofs, plain walls, and an air of efficient simplicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like other building types in the Philippines in the 20th century, churches have moved from revivalist design, such as the neoclassic and neo-Gothic, to modern and contemporary styles, whether functional or romantic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Theaters and Cinemas.</strong>&nbsp;New movie houses were built after World War II, among them the Galaxy on Rizal Ave, designed by Antonio, as well as the Ever on Rizal Ave and Rizal Theater in Makati, both designed by Juan Nakpil and Sons. The Ever was unique for its asymmetrical lobby, the stairs on one side set against a wall-sized mirror. The Rizal Theater, now gone, stood on a lot of its own, and was not hemmed in by adjacent buildings, as was the case with urban cinemas. Instead of the balcony and loge being on a second floor above the orchestra, as in earlier cinemas, the three sections formed one grand ascending curve. The stage was large enough for concerts, musicals, and a memorable performance by the Royal Ballet of England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the first-class movie houses, there were the second-run cinemas, which showed double programs and charged less for admission. These were housed in small buildings or in former first-class movie houses that had suffered poor management or poor maintenance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s, the Manila cinema district shifted from Rizal Ave and the Escolta to Azcarraga and Quezon Blvd. Most spectacular of the new cinemas was the Cinerama on the corner of the last two streets, which had the screen and projectors for the latest panoramic formats from Hollywood. With the urban sprawl, movie houses were built in Cubao, as well as in Makati, Greenhills, Caloocan, Pasay, Mandaluyong, Pasig, and Alabang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FEU Auditorium, designed by Antonio, was housed in the university&rsquo;s Administration Building on Morayta (now Nicanor Reyes St). In the 1950s, it was the only and much used venue for concerts, operas, ballets, musicals, and plays. Manila&rsquo;s first international film festival was held here. Aside from the usual sections&mdash;orchestra, loge, and balcony&mdash;it has a presidential box on loge level at the left of the proscenium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philamlife Auditorium, designed by Arguelles and completed in 1961, is noted for its acoustics, and is still one of the best concert halls in the country. While its stage was not designed for theatrical performances, it has been used nonetheless for operas and musicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Meralco Theater, an adjunct of the Meralco head office building in Pasig, is a tastefully designed auditorium that accommodates 1,080 persons. The orchestra, loge, and balcony are on one vast sloping floor. The stage is well equipped and more than sufficiently spacious for performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1969, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">CCP Main Building</a>, designed by Locsin, was inaugurated. This was a long- standing project where Pres Ferdinand Marcos took interest. As early as the beginning of his first term as president, he supported the project. In 1965, at the proclamation of Marcos as the standard bearer for the Nacionalista Party, his wife, Imelda, spoke of a dream to build a national theater. Toward the end of the first term of Ferdinand Marcos and two months away from the presidential election, the CCP was inaugurated. Attended by a host of celebrities, including California governor Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy, the inauguration was an extravaganza showcasing Philippine culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The center has two theaters: the Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor Abelardo</a> (formerly the Main Theater), which seats 1,805, and the Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a> (formerly the Little Theater), which seats 402. The larger hall is a cubical structure, so formed for acoustical purposes. Seating sections include the orchestra, parterre boxes, two levels of side boxes, and two balconies. With its vast stage, excellent acoustics, sophisticated lighting system, and first-rate stage machinery, the Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo is an incomparable venue for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/775\">symphony concerts</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballets</a>, while the Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino, is ideal for solo recitals, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/772\">chamber music groups</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a>. The main building also houses offices, galleries, a library, and a storage area converted into experimental space for plays, called Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Huseng Batute</a>. The building is an example of architecture as sculpture. A massive block protruding from the main mass of the structure appears to float over the entrance, which is on a podium reached by a driveway that curves around a reflecting pool with fountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CCP would be emblematic of the Marcos regime&rsquo;s use of architecture for statecraft during the era of martial law or the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/212\">Fourth Republic</a>. By the end of his first term, Marcos had built a reputation for improving infrastructure, constructing roads and bridges and widening and improving existing ones. During his term new superhighways linking Manila with the provinces north and south, called North Diversion and South Diversion respectively, were constructed. He accurately boasted that he had built more roads and bridges compared to all his predecessors. Marcos had gathered an able-bodied group of technocrats as his cabinet and pool of advisers. But he also strengthened the military by increasing its budget. Confident of his military backing and the accomplishments of his first term, Marcos ran for re-election in 1969. He was re-elected president by a wide margin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>End of an Era</strong>. Marcos&rsquo;s second presidential term was marked by unrest and rallies, many participated in by students. Despite the long list of Marcos&rsquo;s achievements and the completed infrastructure, problems like the growing number of urban settlers, inadequate public housing, poor education, and a sluggish economy dogged the Marcos presidency. Marcos was seen favoring a group of loyal businessmen, dubbed &ldquo;Marcos cronies,&rdquo; while focusing his ire on the traditional rich, the &ldquo;oligarchs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After winning a second term during the Nov 1969 presidential election, Marcos went to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Congress</a> in Jan 1970 to deliver the State of the Nation address at the opening session of the bicameral legislature. Outside Congress, a large gathering of students from schools and universities in Manila met him at the doors of Congress. The students were demonstrating to bring to public attention various issues that despite Marcos&rsquo;s achievements were not being met. Among the issues were the deteriorating economic conditions of the Filipinos and the problems facing education, especially its rising costs. The rally was covered by media and televised thus projecting the protest more widely. It turned violent as more militant groups influenced by the Communist Party, which were identified by the government as &ldquo;leftist,&rdquo; took the lead in the rally. As the afternoon wore on, the students dispersed but the more militant groups massed at the Mendiola gate of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a>. There the rallyists were dispersed violently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This violent dispersal catalyzed even more vociferous and dramatic protests. This era was called the First Quarter Storm because many student-led rallies erupted in the months that followed. A high point of the student movement was the Diliman Commune, when in Feb 1971 students occupied the buildings of UP Diliman, set up teach-ins, and ran the university without the usual control of professors and the university officials. Riot police sent to disperse the students hesitated to enter the campus, so the military was called in. Threatened with fire power from the military and after many casualties, the students eventually dispersed. The government denounced the commune as communist-led.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attention of the more moderate sectors in society turned to the Constitutional Convention, long a subject of discussion, as a tool for reform. To address the inadequacies of the 1935 Philippine Constitution, drafted while the Philippines was still a commonwealth under the US, various persons and sectors had floated the idea of constitutional reform. Marcos took the challenge and the campaign for delegates to the convention began, slated to open in Jun 1971. But no sooner was the convention assembled when accusations of interference in the election of candidates and the corruption of delegates flew forth. There was also fear that Marcos would use the convention to prolong his presidency, which was to end in 1973, following the term limits of the presidency set by the 1935 constitution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Aug 1971, in the progression toward the congressional election scheduled for November, the Liberal Party, the traditional opponent of the Nacionalista Party to which Marcos belonged, had organized a rally at Plaza Miranda, in front of the Quiapo church. Two grenades were lobbed at the stage injuring the Liberal Party leaders, the effective opposition to Marcos. The government blamed the Communists. At the November election, the Liberals won all the senatorial seats except for two which went to the Nacionalistas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following year, while the Constitutional Convention was still going on, a delegate exposed Marcos&rsquo;s alleged bribery attempt and appealed for votes against a resolution banning Marcos from a third term and banning his relatives from running for the presidency. Then a series of incidents hit the news. Secretary of Defense Juan Ponce Enrile reported the interception of an arms shipment for the Communists. It was brought by the&nbsp;<em>MV Caragatan</em>, but the ship floundered during a storm at Palanan, Isabela, on the Pacific coast of Luzon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A series of bombings in public areas occurred. This set the general population on edge. Then, on 22 Sep 1972, Secretary Enrile&rsquo;s car was allegedly shot at. Although the car was riddled with bullets, Enrile escaped unhurt. Early morning on 23 Sep, Marcos announced over media that he had placed the Philippines under martial law and had signed the decree two days earlier on 21 Sep. No newspapers were printed and distributed that day, because Marcos had ordered the seizure and control of all media outlets like print, radio, and television. The Marcos presidency had not addressed the issues exposed by the many rallies and protest movement but his declaration of martial law, which included a strict curfew, ended all the rallies. Many more were silenced as Marcos rounded up political opponents and incarcerated them for national security reasons. The era of the Third Republic ended with the stroke of the presidential pen. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Rodrigo D.

A slight shower dampened the hopes for a sunny day, but before noon, the sun came out and shone brightly.

After the war, all the public institutions, especially government, the Church, schools, businesses, transportation, communication, and power were challenged to rebuild. Reconstruction followed two paths. The first was to reconstruct what had been damaged during World War II&#x2014;this may be called restoration. <a href=\"/2/6/255\">Restoration</a> involved returning to the past before the war and establishing continuity between the past and the present. The massive destruction, however, in both Manila and the provinces had another face. It opened opportunities for new development and the introduction of the emerging International Style. The second path was to begin new projects in areas where little had been built. This second path would gain ground toward the second half of the 1950s."

Tydings, which the United States Congress passed in Apr 1946. The Tydings Rehabilitation Act disbursed an initial $120 million for the rehabilitation of public buildings and infrastructure. The Philippines&#x2019;s Bureau of Public Works collaborated with an office set up by the United States, the Bureau of Public Roads. The rehabilitation act had conditions which bound the Philippines more closely with the US. Americans were given parity rights to develop and exploit the Philippines&#x2019; natural resources and run public utilities just like any Filipino citizen. The United States also built large military bases in the Philippines, notably at Subic, Zambales and at Clark Field in Angeles, Pampanga."

Funds were dispersed in the form of back pay for members of the United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE), through which Americans and Filipinos engaged hand in hand in combat during World War II. Financial help was also given to strategic private institutions like schools, churches, and factories."

Soon after the war, government buildings were reconstructed in accordance with their original plans, if funding allowed it. When funding was inadequate, the original plans were simplified as had been the case with the <a href=\"/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a> in Manila. The reconstruction phase lasted up to the 1950s. But these funds were not sufficient to address the damaged left by the war. When the Apostolic Delegate, William Piani, organized the Catholic Welfare Organization (CWO) to address the needs of the Catholic Church in the Philippines in the post-World War II era, the organization had to raise funds from private donors to support Church projects because war damage funds were insufficient. Later, the organization evolved to coordinate and organize Catholics in addressing educational, social welfare, religious, and spiritual issues under the bishops. Its constitution was approved by the Vatican on 28 Jun 1952 and in 1968, after Vatican II, it was reorganized as the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP)."

Behind the altar table was a large stained glass window. Tall, narrow windows lighted the interior. On both sides of the choir loft were two tiers of balconies. Designed in Germany for the SVD Fathers, the facade had an expressionist monumental statue of Jesus at the last judgment and angels blowing horns to awaken the dead. Wrought iron rather than stone spires served as decorative finials."

The roof rested on deep arches, which are the entrances to the church. The baptismal font located at the entrance signified that one entered the Church through the sacrament of baptism.

				"value": "The impetus for this heavy-handed renovation was the need to find quick solutions to making historic churches useful. But there was another impetus. In 1965, the Second Vatican Council was concluded in Rome. The council had set the Catholic Church on a path of reform and an influential reform was that of the renewal of the Church&#x2019;s rites or liturgy. Wanting to make the liturgy more accessible, the rites were translated into the vernacular languages. The biggest change happened in the celebration of the Mass. Where before the priest faced the&#xA0;<a href=\"/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a>, in the reform the priest faced the people and entered into a common worship with them marked by a ritualized dialogue between priest and people. Although the full impact of the liturgical reforms did not happen until the 1970s when the reformed Mass text, popularly known as the Missal of Paul VI, was promulgated, liturgical reform began shortly after the council. Some priests had existing altar rails demolished to break the barrier between priest and people and had statues removed from the churches. Vatican II reform did not call for a wholesale restructuring of worship space; in fact, it called for the preservation of historic structures. But an iconoclastic streak infected priests, especially newly ordained ones and those who had studied abroad. They began remodeling historic churches, leading to a loss of church art and artifacts that fed a very active antiques market. Since the post World War II days, there had been an increasing interest in ecclesiastical antique objects. From the 1950s onwards, many of the old churches lost their statues, retablo, altar frontal, sanctuary lamps, and silver ornaments to art collectors and antique dealers. With a growing interest in sacred art, church robberies had become common."

The Las Pi&#xF1;as Church, famous for its <a href=\"/3/15/2095\">bamboo</a> <a href=\"/5/37/820\">organ</a>, counts among the very few examples of proper restoration. In many old churches, the plaster finish was scraped off to expose the brick or adobe walls. This resulted in exposing the material to the elements and to possible deterioration. Water seeping into the walls could eventually damage them. Seeds that get embedded in crevices and joints grow into shrubs whose roots could dislodge stones and bricks from their stable alignment. Equally disastrous has been the application of cement to smoothen the soft lime plastering of the colonial church. This layer is an effective barrier against moisture but while it keeps out the damp from rainfall, it cannot prevent moisture from seeping from the ground to the stones. Without a way for moisture to evaporate because of the cement skin, it condenses and causes the stones to deteriorate."

The PD placed the Philippines under martial law. This was not, as many hoped, a short-term solution but dragged on until 1981, when Marcos, on paper, lifted martial law and called for the election of congress, which was by then a unicameral body, effected by the dissolution of the Senate through the 1972 constitution. Politically, economically, socially, and culturally all institutions were put under the government. Religious institutions, especially the Catholic Church, remained outside the direct control of government but were indirectly controlled through surveillance, the abduction and arrests of Church personnel, and the use of a carrot and stick tactic to keep the Churches under control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among many sectors, martial law was initially greeted with a general sigh of relief after the anxiety caused by the bombings in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">urban areas</a>. While the government blamed the insurgents for the bombing, rumors were afloat that it was the government that perpetrated the bombings to justify martial law. Whoever caused the bombings, their unpredictability left a scared and traumatized population just too happy to feel safe again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the powerful Catholic Church adopted the position of &ldquo;critical collaboration,&rdquo; as enunciated by the bishops of the Philippines. Greatly affected by the student rallies were the many Catholic schools, which lost class days because of rallies or which militant student organizations had infiltrated. Also of concern to the bishops and the right-leaning conservatives was the involvement of the clergy and nuns with militant groups under the National Democratic Front. The popularity of the Latin American theology of liberation, based on a Marxist perspective of society, was also troubling. So, martial law was seen as at least an ad hoc solution to the restlessness within the Church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The imposition of martial law was not a short-term measure, but paved the way for the implementation of the national security state. This ideology of government, which gained adherents in Southeast Asia and Latin America, was born out of the Cold War between Russia and the United States. Security was seen as necessary component in preventing the spread of Communism and a prerequisite for economic growth, which would in turn improve the lives of the common folk. Once the common folk enjoy material prosperity, it was believed that the allure of Communism, which fed on the people&rsquo;s needs for a better life, would disappear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The martial law years were in a period of strong man rule in Southeast Asia: Lee Kuan Yew in Singapore, Mahathir bin Mohamad in Malaysia, Suharto in Indonesia, and the Sultan of Brunei. Strong man rule was seen as a catalyst for economic growth for under the strong man projects could be expedited without the slowdown characteristic of democracies with their parliaments and opposing political parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>With martial law in place, Marcos effectively suspended Congress, passing on rules and laws through PDs. In this atmosphere of control, the arts and architecture were employed in the art of statecraft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Revitalizing Romanticism and Filipinism.</strong> Marcos justified the far-reaching reforms and actions he was doing in a self-authored book of propaganda, <strong><em>Notes on a New Society</em></strong>, 1972. After narrating the events that led to martial law, Marcos expressed his vision of the Bagong Lipunan or New Society which&mdash;with an air of nostalgia and romanticism&mdash;promised to make the Philippines great again. He called for sacrifice and cooperation from the citizenry in his program of social reengineering and cultural revival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Bagong Lipunan, a return to the &ldquo;Great Malayan culture&rdquo; was the vision that spurred government&rsquo;s efforts to enlist the arts and culture in the task of social reform and statecraft. But to continue justifying his position as president, Marcos had to have the constitution reformed by the Constitutional Convention, assembled in Jun 1971, approved through a plebiscite. This plebiscite was conducted under the aegis of martial law. The 1971-1972 Constitution changed the Philippine government from an American-style democracy to a parliamentary system under a prime minister, while Marcos remained president. Government propaganda called his regime &ldquo;constitutional authoritarianism.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under this autocratic rule, the First Lady, Imelda Marcos, played an important role as the catalyst for art. Cultivating a personality cult that styled Marcos and Imelda as the legendary proto-parents Malakas and Maganda, the couple, later called the &ldquo;conjugal dictators&rdquo;, divided government work so that the beautification of the Philippines fell under Imelda Marcos. This was further strengthened when the Task Force for Human Settlements, later renamed the Ministry of Human Settlements, was established and Imelda became its head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martial law architecture called for the return to the Malayan roots of Philippine culture as a catalyst for rebirth and revitalization. In art and architecture this meant a rebirth of the vernacular and ethnic tradition synthesized with the aspirations of modernity in a cosmpolitan world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bagong Lipunan Architecture</strong>. The reclaimed area along Roxas Blvd where in 1969 Marcos had inaugurated the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> became the focus for the Bagong Lipunan&rsquo;s project for building monumental architecture. The vision for architecture was enunciated in two monographs of Imelda Marcos, <strong><em>Architecture: The Social Art</em></strong>, 1970, and <strong><em>Architecture for the Common Man</em></strong>, 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Folk Arts Theater (FAT) was next to be built in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">CCP complex</a>. A hectare in area and seating 10,000, it was completed in 1974. Described as a sheltered plaza, the building is naturally ventilated. The enormous roof rests on only eight columns, which support a span of 80 m. The FAT established a record for having been built in 77 days. In its race against time, the construction of this theater was a dramatic event because the Philippines was scheduled to host the Miss Universe Pageant in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By virtue of PD 279, 24 Aug 1973, Imelda took the lead in the conception and construction of the Design Center at the CCP complex. A Letter of Instruction no. 73, 13 May 1974, formed a body to study ways to make Metro Manila the Asian regional headquarters of international companies. When the Metropolitan Manila Commission was created in 1975 with the First Lady as appointed governor, she dubbed her domain as the &ldquo;City of Man.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also on the drawing board were plans to develop Manila as an international convention center. For the forthcoming International Monetary Fund meeting in 1976, the state-of-the-art Philippine International Convention Center (PICC) was built. In May 1979, the Philippines hosted the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in the Philtrade Center that was built using pre-fabricated structures originally intended for schools. The center was given the steep-sloping roof of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Styles.</strong> The buildings at the CCP complex set the official architectural style of Imelda&rsquo;s City of Man and of the Bagong Lipunan. They objectified what was Filipino and Malay by a set of recurring shapes, like the steep and hip roof of the ethnic tradition, the use of local material like hardwood, adobe, Romblon marble, and a veneer of Mactan stone, cut from the fossilized and exposed reef of the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were two distinct approaches to romance with the native represented by two architects who worked with Imelda&rsquo;s projects. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>, the architect of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">CCP performing arts theater</a>, represented the abstract approach. He did not seek to replicate the features of ethnic architecture but evoked it through the use of line and volume. His vertical arches that lifted a monolith echoed the houses on stilts of vernacular architecture. But, in keeping with modernity, he did not give the building a steep roof but rather hid the roof with a parapet. Locsin focused more on volume and overall shape as he did with the Folk Arts Theater and PICC. Locsin, however, kept the rough finish of his buildings, exposing the material for construction. The second approach represented by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2674\">Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa</a> and the architectural firm he had established was more literal. Ma&ntilde;osa had made a name for himself in the successful adaptation of the bahay kubo to urban residences. While having all the pleasing qualities of vernacular architecture&mdash;the light filled interiors, the interaction between outdoor and indoor, the use of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">natural materials</a>, like stone and wood&mdash;the residences were nonetheless modern with all the conveniences associated with contemporary living. He was commissioned to design a state guesthouse that would showcase Filipino identity and would use coconut and its by-products. Ma&ntilde;osa designed Tahanang Filipino more popularly known as Coconut Palace. He designed the units as hexagons, gave it a double roof reminiscent of the salakot, and used the swing-out or <strong>tukod</strong> window derived from the bahay kubo. The interiors were furnished with coconut, bamboo, rattan, <strong>capiz</strong> shells, textile, and an assortment of indigenous materials and textures, including tobacco.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Deriving inspiration from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/208\">ethnic tradition</a> and vernacular architecture, Bagong Lipunan architecture merged modernism with tradition, in a search for primeval purity postulated as the true wellspring of national identity and the national soul. Thus, the elements from the vernacular and indigenous tradition were used. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">Schoolhouses</a> of the Marcos era were especially being designed so that they integrated elements from the local area; thus the schemes for schoolhouses generated by Ministry of Public Works and Highway used the flaring beam derived from Mindanao&rsquo;s <strong>okir</strong> for its designs of schools in Mindanao. Elsewhere, proposed school buildings used many elements from the bahay kubo, like its elevation from the ground, the steep roof, and the awning-type windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hip roof, whether terminating in an inverted pyramid finial recalling the shape of an Ifugao dwelling or truncated as used in the Makiling National Arts Center or the Batasang Pambansa, was characteristically Bagong Lipunan. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2668\">Lico</a> (2003, 451) characterizes this era as one of &ldquo;vernacular renaissance.&rdquo; But vernacular architecture was not the only stream in Bagong Lipunan era architecture because modernism continued to develop. Modernism&rsquo;s severe lines and uncluttered surface define the University of Life in Pasig. The sculptural use of concrete in PICC is modernist. Later, architecture turned toward an abstraction of classicism, when the Manila Film Center, 1982, was designed by Froilan Hong to evoke the Parthenon at Athens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"forms\" name=\"forms\"></a>Forms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dwellings and Residences.</strong> In the early 1960s, during the presidency of Marcos&rsquo;s predecessor Diosdado Macapagal (1961-65), another form of mass housing, rather than detached residences, was attempted: namely, the tenement, a multistory, multiple-unit building, such as that along the South Superhighway, at Punta in Santa Ana, and in Tondo. This was not quite satisfactory. A perennial problem in the Macapagal tenement was that there was not enough pressure to bring water to the upper floors of the high buildings. As a result, sanitation and maintenance became a problem, setting the stage for decay. Occupation density also became a problem and criminality was rampant in this demoralizing setting. By 2011 these tenements had been declared unfit for habitation and ordered demolished but nothing has been done thus far and people still live in these substandard high-rises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The multistory tenement was adopted with modifications by the Bagong Lipunan Sites and Services (BLISS) housing projects of the Marcos regime. It consisted of four-story buildings with two or four units per floor. These apartments were built in various places like Guadalupe in Makati, and Diliman near UP, and near Project 7 in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The BLISS apartments were better <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/254\">designed</a> than the housing project units and tenement of the Macapagal era. With only four stories, the buildings had adequate water supply. By reducing the scale of mass housing and providing adequate open spaces, the BLISS apartments were an improvement but they were unfortunately too costly for the low-salaried worker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Imelda, government had other projects of mass housing at Dagat-dagatan in Malabon and the Tondo foreshore for instance. In Taguig, it created Maharlika Village to house Muslims who had sought refuge in Metro Manila. Many had migrated because of the conflict in Mindanao. A <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/234\">mosque</a> was built and also an Olympic-size swimming pool. The government recognized that the Muslims were good swimmers and hoped to generate future Olympians by encouraging them to take on the sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To decongest Manila, Imelda inaugurated a project of building satellite cities, which she made public in a speech on 7 Jun 1976 at an international conference held in Vancouver, Canada, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements. There she announced the construction of Lungsod Silangan (Eastern City) on the foothills of the Sierra Madre in Antipolo. The satellite cities would be built along the Manila-Infanta highway that the government was building to link Manila to the Pacific Coast. The decision for the location of this city was arrived at through a computer-generated land use map, which respected the ecological balance of the area. The generation of this map was headed by DrCelso Roque. An area of 20,300 ha of prime agricultural land and forest was mapped out in Antipolo and in typical Imelda fashion, a pilot was built quickly and named Bagong Bayan (New Country), following the master plan of the Planning Resources Operations System (PROS) inaugurated in 1977. The model houses built were a contemporary adaptation of the bahay kubo. Raised from the ground by reinforced concrete stilts, the houses had steep roofs of galvanized iron sheets, a small balcony by the entrance, and steel casement windows. The houses were sited in separate family lots along a road system that followed the contour of the land. Some of the roads between the houses were intended for pedestrian traffic and were narrow cemented pathways. Beyond the pilot nothing much was done to concretize this scheme. The Manila-Infanta road came to a stop when construction hit areas where there was strong NPA presence and the road builders were harassed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1980s, mass housing developers promoted a new scheme that took into account the Filipino&rsquo;s preference for a dwelling on ground level. A so-called starter house of 20 sqm was built on a 60-sqm lot. The house could be expanded to 40 sqm on ground level, and 20 sqm could be added further by constructing a second floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new method of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">construction</a> has been applied in a housing project in Vitas, Tondo, comprising 1,664 units distributed among 27 four-story buildings on a 2.5-hectare site. Prefabricated box-shaped concrete units are stacked in such a manner that 29 units and the spaces between them result in a total of 50 dwellings. The system, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2643\">Cesar Canchela</a>, is called the Canchela Shelter Components and Stacking Process for Multi-story Buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">high-rise dwelling</a> resonated with the private sector. During this era, the multiple residence and multiple-owned condominium buildings arose. Developers would build the high-rises and sell the individual apartment units even before construction at a special pre-construction price, which could be cheaper by 30 percent or more than the selling price upon completion. It was an attractive investment for those who had money to spare or who were looking for residence in a more central location, close or within the business district of an area, rather than in the gated villages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Makati is the birthplace of condominiums, where <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">apartments</a> were rented and where condominium units, which could be residential or office space, were bought. Some of the best apartment and condominium buildings stand in a row on Ayala Ave, like the Urdaneta Apartments designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2635\">Arguelles</a>, the Twin Towers by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2647\">William Coscolluela</a>, and the Ritz Towers by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2701\">Sindiong</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">townhouses</a> are, curiously, located not in town but in the suburbs or in quiet residential areas. The spacious lots of old mansions in Quezon City and San Juan have been taken over by townhouses. A townhouse is the upper-class version of the row house. It is a two- or three-story substantially built unit that stands cheek by jowl with similar units. Townhouses are usually in guarded compounds and are arranged in a straight line or around courts. Common facilities in the compound include playgrounds and swimming pools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the Filipinist slant of Bagong Lipunan architecture, architects who designed residences of the upper class adapted many features from vernacular and local traditions like the use of adobe, terra cotta tiles from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, rough walls like the CCP&rsquo;s, and Mactan stones, while employing modern concepts of residential design geared for safety, comfort, and convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Government Office Buildings.</strong> Another aspect of the Bagong Lipunan architectural program was to preserve and reuse the legacy of the past. This expressed itself in the interest in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">heritage conservation</a>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a> were the centers of such conservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imelda took a more active and decisive hand at restoring the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">walls of Intramuros</a>. Previously, the cleaning and rehabilitation of the walls began under Macapagal, when informal residents living in the vaults of the wall or within the walled city were relocated to Sapang Palay and the unemployed given temporary work cleaning the walls and Intramuros under Macapagal&rsquo;s Emergency Employment Agency (EEA). Under Imelda, the replastering of the walls, the reconstruction of its damaged gates, and the archaeological investigation of Intramuros began. In 1979, PD 1616 created the Intramuros Administration (IA) to take charge of Intramuros and oversee its conservation. IA was placed under the Ministry of Human Settlements, which Imelda headed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the projects of IA was the reconstruction of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/237\">Palacio del Gobernador</a> where the Human Settlements would have its office. The Palacio was damaged in the earthquakes of 1863 and 1880 and was left in ruins when the governor general transferred residence to Malaca&ntilde;an. The empty adobe shell of its first story became the base for a 14-story tower, which while evoking the lines of neoclassicism challenged the traditional zoning laws of Intramuros, which set restrictions for building heights. The tower rivaled the bell tower of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> in height, falling a few meters below the tower&rsquo;s cupola. While the Palacio del Gobernador&rsquo;s tower respected the letter of the law that no structure in Intramuros should be taller than the cathedral tower, it decisively changed the landscape of the area around Plaza Mayor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malaca&ntilde;an, another historic building, fell into the process of restoration and renovation. Although Malaca&ntilde;an had been renovated, expanded, and adapted to new uses by its residents from American governors general to Philippine presidents, during the Marcos era, it took the lead in projecting Philippine architecture even more. In 1965, the Marcos Room was added to the residential section. The Executive Building erected in 1921 by Gov-Gen Leonard Wood had its second floor cleared to make way for the Maharlika Hall in 1975. This building housed the Office of the President.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1978 to 1979, Imelda had the presidential palace&rsquo;s residential area renovated. Windows were covered with bulletproof glass, the external walls pushed forward and central air-conditioning was installed. At the east and residential wing, an open atrium from the time of Gov Dwight Davis was covered with a colored fiberglass skylight embellished with stylized coconut leaves in a sunburst design of eight rays. On the second floor of the atrium, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">bas-reliefs</a> carved by Paete artisans interpreted the historic works of Angono artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a>. The private quarters of the First Family were paneled with Philippine hardwood, given a coffered ceiling and decorated with carvings by Betis artisans. Spanish colonial <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> was mixed with pieces in other European and Asian styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malaca&ntilde;an&rsquo;s main wing, Kalayaan, housed the Rizal Hall or Ceremonial Hall, the place for grand meetings with large groups. Like the residential quarters the hall was paneled with hardwood and had two domed coffered ceilings reminiscent of the ceiling design of the Pantheon in Rome. In the center of the ceiling were hung wood and crystal chandeliers. Swags and other ornaments of carved wood decorated the entrances from which hung curtains. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">Capiz</a> was used to filter light coming through the windows and capiz dividers were used to mark out space. On a raised platform with a carved background of hardwood made to resemble sawali or woven bamboo was the presidential seal. Underneath, the president would sit for important occasions. The floor was carpeted crimson with yellow gold trim designed as a braided rope and swags of foliage. All told in 1979, seven years after the declaration of martial law, Malaca&ntilde;an was awash with the elements of Bagong Lipunan nationalist aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1978, the long-standing steel structure left derelict for decades was reused for the new legistature in Quezon City. The central session hall of the complex, designed by Felix Mendoza, had a truncated pyramid roof. Flanking it on two sides and connected by wide low corridors were the multistory office buildings of the new Batasang Pambansa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1978, the Security Plant Complex of the Central Bank of the Philippines, was established in Quezon City. Surrounded by a dry moat and tall fence, this complex was responsible for refining and minting gold, minting coins, printing money and other security papers such as passports, Internal Revenue stamps, Treasury warrants, etc. Its building is in a severe bunker style modernist architecture. It conveys solidity, stability, and impregnability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1981, the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) moved from Quezon City to a new office complex in Roxas Blvd&rsquo;s reclamation area. Designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2695\">Jorge Ramos</a>, the complex is a modernist horizontal structure composed of clusters of buildings of various heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schools</strong>. The amelioration of education was another project undertaken under martial law. University of Life in Pasig was to be a signature school that would combine the best of the university and the technical curriculum. Its buildings were decidedly more modernist but it nodded to the vernacular in its use of natural material like bricks and adobe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A school unique for its setting and tropical architecture is the National Arts Center on the slopes of Mt Makiling in Laguna, and the adjoining high school for the arts. The buildings of the complex were designed by Locsin. Imelda dreamt of establishing a Parnassus of the arts, where young, talented, and promising artists were recruited from the graduates of the elementary years and transported to live in an atmosphere that breathed art, away from the corruption of the cities. The resident faculty was then limited in number. Many were administrators. Teachers from UP were bused in to teach or in some cases, the students were brought to Manila for classes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin departed from his abstraction of vernacular architecture and constructed the National Arts Center with the hip roof of vernacular architecture. He, however, cut off the apex, making the outline that of a truncated pyramid. The adjoining buildings were in a similar style. The idyllic setting amidst a tropical forest made Locsin take advantage of the outdoors; this is especially evident in the school&rsquo;s open chapel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The influence of Bagong Lipunan nativist aesthetics were echoed in private schools like the Asian Institute of Management building in Makati, a major work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2660\">Gabriel Formoso</a>. It is an efficient, well-equipped building with wooden panels or <strong>bandejas</strong> and adobe stone on the exterior, a style alluding to the <strong>bahay na bato</strong> (stone house). Spacious carpeted, air-conditioned classrooms set apart the International School, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2675\">Jose Ma&ntilde;osa</a>, who gave the buildings a nativisitic air by using brick facings that alluded to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">bricks</a> used during the Spanish era. The Benedictine Abbey School (Saint Benedict College, later San Beda-Alabang) in Alabang, Muntinlupa, also by Ma&ntilde;osa, departed from the standard floor plan. Instead of rectangular rooms arranged in a row along a corridor, hexagonal classrooms were clustered around a central space, creating a sense of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">community</a> like rural barrios and sitios where houses clustered around a focus, like a chapel or the house of the village leader. The school building also modified the hip roof of Philippine vernacular architecture to fit the hexagonal plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospitals</strong>. Imelda took an interest in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>. One project was the expansion of the Philippine General Hospital. Along with the rehabilitation of the pre-World War II buildings was the addition of a seven-story tower complex. Respecting the lines of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">heritage building</a>, architect Jorge Ramos echoed the arcades of the Mission revival style of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2690\">Parsons</a>. The completed project was inaugurated on 2 Jul 1985, Imelda&rsquo;s birthday. Ramos had earlier worked with Imelda in building the Philippine Heart Center, which came about after Imelda had visited Houston and seen the specialized hospital dedicated to the circulatory system. Later, Imelda would push for other specialized hospitals along East Ave and the Quezon Circle in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine Heart Center for Asia in Quezon City, designed by Ramos and inaugurated on 14 Feb 1975, has two types of accommodations for patients: wards and private rooms. The latter are grouped into &ldquo;petals,&rdquo; i.e., 10 to 14 rooms are clustered around the nurses&rsquo; station and are accessible to visitors through peripheral corridors, which are continuous glassed-in balconies. This arrangement requires more space than the standard rows of rooms along corridors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as the Bagong Lipunan fostered a return to roots through architecture, Imelda commissioned local artists to create nativist works, particularly large <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">murals</a> for various buildings celebrating Malakas and Maganda. The Philippine Heart Center mural portrayed Imelda Marcos as a loving mother in Filipina dress embracing the handicapped, aged, and infirm of all ages. Flanking her are troops of doctors, nurses, and health specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Kidney Institute, also in Quezon City, was a two-story, Y-shaped building with a courtyard at the center, which was later roofed. Recently, the hospital was remodeled with additional wings obscuring the original plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The floor plan of the Lung Center of the Philippines is basically two &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; or two squares in diagonal position, hanging by their top corners from the arms of a T and joined at their middle corners at the shafts of a T. A horizontal bar, running through the center of the diamonds, forms the &ldquo;spine&rdquo; where common facilities are located. The sides of the diamonds, called &ldquo;wings,&rdquo; contain the rooms and wards. Vertical bars running through the centers of the squares are supplementary corridors. In the T-block are common facilities. The bottom of the T, aligned with the bottom corners of the diamonds, form the entrance area. The &ldquo;wings&rdquo; of the building do not spread out, so to speak, but are folded and interconnected in a compact plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imelda also spearheaded the construction of the Philippine Children&rsquo;s Medical Center along Quezon Blvd and near the Quezon Circle. This hospital was especially dedicated to children with rare and terminal diseases like cancer. The center is in modernist style and established in 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With rapid developments in medical science and technology, and with the specialized services and sophisticated facilities expected by clients and patients, the design of hospitals and medical centers has increasingly challenged the ingenuity and creativity of architects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Commercial Buildings</strong>.</strong> The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/373\">San Miguel Corporation (SMC) Head Office</a> in Mandaluyong, designed by Jose Ma&ntilde;osa and completed in 1984, shines like a giant prism and recalls the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/241\">Banaue rice terraces</a>. Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa&rsquo;s Tahanang Pilipino at the CCP complex and his tent-shaped Mary Immaculate Parish Church in Las Pi&ntilde;as are statements of the Filipinism he advocates, i.e., the return to indigenous architectural forms and the use of thatch, bamboo, and wood in contemporary buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin designed the Benguet Corporation Building in the Ortigas Business District in the 1980s and used generous amounts of stone facing, recalling the basalt formation of the Central Cordillera, the site of Benguet&rsquo;s mines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Malls and Arcades.</strong> The Milelong Arcade, whose facade was designed after the Milelong Barracks in Corregidor Island, the Creekside Arcade, and Sunvar Plaza in Makati are long narrow buildings with shops, restaurants, and offices in linear array on ground level and on the upper floors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greenbelt Mall and The QUAD in Makati and Ali Mall in Quezon City are large, sprawling multistory buildings housing a variety of establishments. In SM City in Quezon City, SM Megamall in Mandaluyong, SM Centerpoint in Santa Mesa, Robinsons Galleria in Ortigas, Shangri-la Plaza in Mandaluyong, and Gotesco Grand Central in Caloocan, the shopping mall is attached to a large department store, or vice versa. Shopping malls, such as Virra (now V) Mall and Shoppesville in Greenhills, Harrison Plaza in Manila, and various malls and arcades in Makati, are clusters of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/224\">commercial establishments</a> with no dominant superstore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mall or galleria is a long building with a high central concourse flanked by several levels of galleries on which various establishments are located. Levels are linked by stairs, escalators, and elevators. Where a long building is not possible, the concourse becomes a plaza or atrium, likewise several stories high. An outdoor feeling is created in the concourse or plaza with the use of skylights, fountains, and greenery. Banners, several stories in length, hang over the concourse, giving it a festive air. The ambiance is appealing to people for whom shopping is an act of celebration. The mall is not only a magnified market and a compact movie district, but also a covered promenade made especially inviting by central air-conditioning. A mall is a small city in itself housing shops, restaurants, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">supermarkets</a>, department stores, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">movie houses</a>, and recreational facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Clubhouses</strong>. The Alabang Golf and Country Club, designed by Formoso and completed in 1978, contains its complex of indoor facilities in one vast rectangular structure. It represents the architect&rsquo;s constant striving for simplicity in design. The massive roof, basically hipped but varied in height and configuration, harmonizes with the outline of distant mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine Columbian Association clubhouse in Paco, Manila and the Makati Sports Club, both the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2707\">Rogelio Villarosa</a>, are sports complexes in an urban setting. While massive walls on the street side preserve privacy, wide covered porches leading to an open area provide companionable space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Club Filipino in Greenhills, designed by Formoso and built in 1970, follows the style of the bahay na bato in its form and in its use of stone, wood, and capiz windows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hotels</strong>. Within the tourist belt, not far from Roxas Blvd, are the Manila Pavilion (formerly Manila Hilton), the Manila Midtown Hotel, and the Century Park Sheraton. In Makati are the Hotel Intercontinental Manila, the Hotel Nikko Manila Garden, the Manila Peninsula, the Mandarin Oriental, and the Shangri-la Manila. Near the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) is the Philippine Village Hotel, which has not been reconstructed since it was gutted by fire. In 1976, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> was renovated and expanded with the addition at the back of an 18-story tower containing guest rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In preparation for the IMF meeting in 1977, the government made 500 million pesos available through foreign loans to 14 hotels to prepare for the influx of foreign guests. The Admiral Hotel, Century Park Sheraton, Holiday Inn, Hotel Mirador, Manila Garden Hotel, Manila Hotel (renovation), Manila Mandarin, Manila Midtown Ramada, Manila Peninsula, Philippine Plaza on the reclamation area near CCP, Regent of Manila, Silahis International Hotel, El Grande, Pines Hotel, Makati Hotel, Mayon Imperial Hotel, Davao Insular, Mabuhay Hotel, Punta Baluarte, Ambassador Hotel, Sulu Hotel, and Philippine Village Hotel were among those who availed of state-guaranteed loans. Within a short period, the massive upgrading and building of five-star hotels sparked the building boom of the late 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the tourist-oriented hotel project had a downside. To shield tourists from the many <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\">urban poor settlements</a>, 60,000 were evicted from the city and sent to relocation sites in the provinces. When time to complete the relocation ran out, shanty communities along the highway and major roads were obscured with temporary whitewashed walls, oversized plant boxes, plantings of coconut and bananas, and grass that was even spray painted green to give the delegates a rustic image of urban Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IMF set the stage for tourism to become an important dollar-generating industry. The Bagong Lipunan encouraged the private sector to develop tourist areas. In 1972, PD 1 established the Department of Trade and Tourism; then in 1973, Pres Marcos created a new independent cabinet position, the Department of Tourism (DOT). Under the DOT were the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) and the Philippine Convention Bureau (PCB). The DOT became the Ministry of Tourism under the 1973 Constitution and reverted back to DOT in 1986 under Executive Order 120 and 120-A, signed by Pres Corazon Aquino. PTA was tasked with implementing policies and programs of DOT and developing, promoting, and supervising tourism projects. PTA established hostels and other forms of accommodations in potential tourist destinations that did not have sufficient infrastructure in the form of hotels and lodging houses. Among its projects were the Banaue Hotel, Youth Hostel, and Mount Data Hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Churches.</strong> The martial law era was not a notable era for church building. Among the Catholics, the traditional central role of the church building was questioned by the younger clergy who perceived that the challenge of the time was to rethink and reconfigure what Church as community should be. During this era, it was quite common for priests to celebrate Mass at venues other than the church or chapel. Masses took place in homes, hospitals, funeral parlors, and out in the open in picket lines and rallies, especially after 1983. The focus during this era was a return to the people. The basic ecclesial community movement brought the center of worship to the peripheries. Young priests were generally not keen about construction, looking at interest in such projects as pre-Vatican II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there was a slowdown in church building, Catholic churches were built and those built during the Fourth Republic shared the vernacular aesthetics of Bagong Lipunan architecture. This was not in imitation of the prevalent style but rather arose from another impulse. The translation from Latin into the vernaculars of Church rites was in consonance with a theme of Vatican II to dialogue with culture. This dialogue was called &ldquo;inculturation,&rdquo; that is, the rooting of Christian doctrine and practice in cultures other than the dominant culture of the West. Experimenting with indigenous material, motifs, shapes, and colors, both designers and clerics sought to integrate Philippine cultural expression with Catholic faith. A visible pioneer in this path was Fr Ruben Villote. Assigned to Tipas, a barrio of Taguig, Rizal in 1969, four years after Vatican II, he built the parish not by building a church but organizing the church community. Tipas had an adobe Spanish era chapel but Tipas was a poor community of fisherfolk, farmers, and poultry raisers. Not having resources, Villote decorated the church with the ingenious bamboo creations of artisans of the community. Named Dambanang Kawayan, it was a pioneer in the use of local material and the adaptation of vernacular aesthetics to church design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than grand churches, the more common structures were chapels in subdivisions, gated communities, and in the settlements of urban poor. Although made of reinforced concrete and galvanized roof, the structures were small, had open sides, which could be grilled, a facade and sanctuary. Decorated with store-bought, mass-produced statuary and art work, these chapels did not always have the benefit of an architect or designer. Typical of these churches is San Nicolas de Tolentino built in 1975, in Congressional Subdivision, Quezon City. Its facade of bricks is nondescript. A cement cross is the only ornament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When larger churches were built, they were designed to conform to Vatican II&rsquo;s norm that architecture should foster active participation in Church Liturgy. Claret School&rsquo;s Immaculate Heart of Mary Church, 1972, was designed by Locsin, who conceptualized it as a stylized salakot consisting of triangles that spiraled upwards terminating in a finial on which the cross is mounted. The triangles are crossed by horizontals evoking the shape of a terraced hill. The interior reflects the exterior with the triangles leading the eye upward. The interior, like the exterior, is finished in concrete. The interior is embellished with a wooden sculpture of the Risen Christ. The church plan was a fan, a shape that located the altar as the focal point and had excellent sight lines so that the liturgy was clearly visible from all parts of a church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don Bosco Church in Makati was built beside Don Bosco, a school established by the Salesian Fathers who set up a house in Makati in 1951. In 1976, Jaime Cardinal Sin, established a parish for the residents of Barangay Dulo and San Lorenzo Village in Makati. The parish was placed under the care of the Salesians. The following year, on 15 Aug 1977, the cardinal officiated at the laying of the corner stone and on 4 Mar 1978, the church was completed. The church was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2708\">Jose Ma. Zaragoza</a>, known for his design of churches. Zaragoza would take inspiration from the anahaw leaf which dominates the sanctuary. From the anahaw design is projected a rib vault echoing the anahaw shape. The church is fan-shaped. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3469\">Eduardo Castrillo</a>, an alumnus of Don Bosco, made the bronze crucifix that dominates the sanctuary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Shrine Our Lady of Fatima, 1977, in Valenzuela on Fatima Ave is also fan-shaped, with exaggerated steep overhangs over the windows terminating in a crown-like effect. Large expanses of glass fill the the facade windows. The fan-shaped plan gained popularity because it was believed to be best suited for Vatican II&rsquo;s guidance on liturgies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Established in 1976, the Sacred Heart Church in Makati was built of concrete. The church was expanded soon after when it was raised to the status of a National Shrine. The church works on a modern interpretation of the Roman arch used in the facade and bell tower. The exterior is crowned by a dome. The interior, after its expansion and renovation, follows the design of colonial churches with exposed beams, an arco toral, and a semi-circular sanctuary with a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> dominated by a painting of the Sacred Heart. The interior is more <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> than modern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Built in 1980, Our Lady of Miraculous Medal Shrine was planned as a Greek cross with its transept crossing curved rather than angled. From the four points of the cross rise spiraling curves that come together at the center to form a spire and cross. The roof is of poured reinforced concrete. It was designed by Zaragoza, the designer of Don Bosco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Catholics were not the only ones who built churches; other religious groups did too. The Iglesia ni Cristo built churches; so did the Church of Latter Day Saints or Mormons. Unlike Catholics, both groups favored a standard style, based on the gothic. Lico (2008, 427) calls this style &ldquo;stripped gothic,&rdquo; a simplified gothic. The INC style allows a certain diversity within basic forms. The apparent uniformity of style could be understood to signify solidarity or a common single-mindedness. In fact, such uniformity heightens the visibility and ubiquity of a minority church. The Mormon Meeting House used spires and other elements like tall windows from gothic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Union Church of Manila, built 1975, located in Makati, has an elliptical sanctuary or assembly hall. The roof, a disk with a crown at the center, appears to be of folded-plate construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Theaters and Cinema.</strong> The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">stand-alone cinemas</a> of the 1950s to the 1960s were replaced by smaller movie houses built inside a mall. An early version of this new type of movie house was in the QUAD, a mall in Makati which had four small cinemas, named, Q, U, A, and D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CCP dominated the field of the performing arts. Not only was it the official venue for state-sponsored performances, but it was also the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theater</a> of choice because of its state of the art equipment. But Imelda had her eyes on a much neglected iconic theater, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan</a>, built in the 1930s but damaged by war and abandoned. Restored in 1978, it was inaugurated with great fanfare. After the Fourth Republic, the Theater fell into disuse and was left derelict, but is currently being restored again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the International Film Festival, the Manila Film Center, 1982, was designed by Froilan Hong to evoke the Parthenon at Athens. But the construction was met with tragedy. While a floor was being poured, the weight of the wet cement caused the forms and scaffolding to collapse, burying workers underneath. Because of the desire to meet a deadline, it was alleged that construction continued and no serious attempt was made to rescue the injured workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Infrastructure.</strong> Continuing the infrastructure constructed from 1965 to 1972, Marcos expanded the government&rsquo;s involvement in infrastructure. Addressing the need for irrigation and hydroelectric energy, the Philippine Congress approved in 1969 the construction of the Pantabangan Dam in Nueva Ecija, but the project would not begin until 1971 and continued up to 1977 during the martial law years. Although the Pantabangan Dam would have submerged a 300-year old town, opposition to the plan did not prosper because by 1972, when construction was in full swing, martial law had been declared. Some 1,300 residents were transferred to higher ground and with them the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another dam project, the Chico River Dam, sponsored by a loan from the IMF, met with opposition from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> because it would flood ancestral land. Despite strong arm tactics that included military intervention, the Kalinga were able to rally support to oppose the project and in the 1980s, IMF withdrew its proffered loan and the project ended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1984 to 1985, the Light Rail Transit (LRT) was launched to provide Metro Manila a light elevated rail system, that would run through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Taft Ave</a> from its southern terminal and depot along Airport Road, arriving at Baclaran for its first stop and running all the way to Monumento, after traveling through Rizal Ave. Its route traversed three cities: Pasay, Manila, and Caloocan. The light rail was sponsored by the Ministry of Human Settlements under Imelda as a means of mass transportation and a system of easing traffic along Manila&rsquo;s main thoroughfare. The LRT provoked controversy but this could not find expression under the Marcos regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another project that would arouse controversy but could not be criticized openly was the establishment of Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) in 1977. Because casinos promoted gambling, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines saw this as objectionable but they would take time before launching public protests against gambling. The government justified the establishment of PAGCOR by saying that it brought revenue to the government, second only tothe Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). PAGCOR operated because of its strict laws about gambling and because many of its casinos were operated in the context of a hotel, one of which was Hilton Manila. Later casinos would become part resort or entertainment complex, usually high-end. Like Las Vegas casinos, aside from gambling tables, the complex provided entertainment and restaurant services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1973, Marcos and his wife inaugurated the San Juanico Bridge, which crosses the San Juanico Strait to connect the islands of Samar and Leyte. With its main span designed as an arch-shaped truss, the bridge measures 2.16 kms or 1.34 miles long, one of the longest bridges in the Philippines, second only to the Candaba Viaduct in Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A project for electricity generation, the construction of Bataan Nuclear Power Plant was begun in 1976, but was never finished. Built in Morong, the plant was to provide electricity to the export processing zone in Bataan and the rest distributed throughout central Luzon. While the plant was being built, the Three Mile Island disaster in the US had indirectly put a halt to the project and generated a review of the construction, especially its safety. The safety report documented that the plant had 4,000 defects and that it was built on a geological fault. By 1984, $2.3 billion had been spent on the almost finished plant. During Corazon Aquino&rsquo;s presidency, its construction was abandoned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>End of the Regime</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the fateful days of Feb 1986 that led to the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos and his wife Imelda from power, Marcos&rsquo;s Bagong Lipunan was already falling apart. The dramatic rise in infrastructure projects and the many building projects of Imelda and the private sector, made possible by government-backed foreign loans, were hurting the economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of these infrastructure projects were overpriced and the practice of bribery culled from the private sector who wanted to bid or invest in a project marred the regime&rsquo;s signature infrastructure program. The overpriced, unused Bataan nuclear power plant was symbolic of the way the Marcos regime had misused public funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The economy was characterized by uneven growth and despite the glorious propaganda of Bagong Lipunan, the reality was quite different. Urban migrants were on the increase and shanty towns were expanding. The land reform program began by Marcos produced uneven results and did not enrich former tenants of rice farms. In fact, they sunk in deeper debt because to raise high-yield rice, they needed fertilizers. The farmers could not afford the input needed for rice production and the government was unable to set up an effective system of financing the emancipated tenants. The government built infrastructure projects that did not function well, if at all, and much money was being used to service the Philippines&rsquo;s foreign debt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regime was hard put financing its expenses. Taxes, remittances from Filipinos who migrated as overseas contractual workers, especially to the Middle East, foreign grants and aid, and income from the rental of US military bases and PAGCOR were not enough. Government corporations were not yielding income and some became the milking cows of Marcos&rsquo;s cronies. If Imelda was able to make what had come to be known as &ldquo;Imeldific&rdquo; projects, this was made possible because of foreign loans. As the government found it necessary to borrow in order to finance its building and infrastructure projects, the Philippines&rsquo;s foreign loans had mushroomed toward the end of the Fourth Republic. All that the government could afford to pay was the interest rather than the loan principal itself. This set the government on a downward spin to economic collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lacking financial support, many Bagong Lipunan projects were never realized. The era that celebrated the vernacular and projected an image of a developing country with up-to-date, state-of-the-art architecture and facilities, proud to display what was Filipino, showed its true color&mdash;an impoverished nation able to survive and project development because it could make foreign loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Already weakened financially, a political challenge appeared on the horizon when former Sen Benigno Aquino, said to be the only politician who could challenge Marcos, returned to Manila on 21 Aug 1983. Aquino said he was going to talk to Marcos and map out a plan for Marcos to step down graciously and make room for an election. Traveling under a passport with the name Marcial Bonifacio, Aquino was escorted from his seat as soon as the airplane from Taiwan had landed. Flanked by guards, he was brought down the emergency exit of the landing tube to the tarmac&mdash;and there shot to death. This assassination caused massive protests and the boycott of the businesses of Marcos&rsquo;s cronies, causing the economy to drop by 6.8% and leaving the Philippines bankrupt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Various other events weakened Marcos&rsquo;s hold on power. Although Marcos had appointed Chief Justice Enrique Fernando to head a commission to investigate the assassination in early 1984, the results were widely disbelieved. He appointed a new commission in October which concluded that a faction in the military had conspired to assassinate Aquino, but the conspiracy reportedly did not go any higher than low-ranking officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also widespread rumor that Marcos&rsquo;s health was compromised and he was no longer fully capable of governing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcos&rsquo;s legitimacy as president was called into question by the growing protests that characterized the years 1983 to 1986. Emboldened by the apparent inability of the Marcos regime to contain the demonstrations, the protests got louder, more vociferous and frequent. Succumbing to both popular protests and pressure from the US, Marcos announced a snap election in 1985, one year short of the regular election. Batas Pambansa 883 legalized the election. In opposition to Marcos, Corazon C. Aquino, widow of Benigno, and Salvador Laurel ran as president and vice-president respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elections were held on 7 Feb 1986, and the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) declared Marcos president, as it was reported he garnered 10.8 million votes against Aquino&rsquo;s 9.29 million. Reports of widespread cheating and manipulation of votes led to a dramatic moment as 29 COMELEC computer technicians walked out, alleging data tampering. Both sides claimed victory: 52% of votes had gone to Marcos, while the Aquino camp, supported by the findings of NAMFREL (National Movement for Free Elections), counted 53% in favor of Aquino. Condemning the elections were statements from the Catholic Hierarchy, which had been growing more critical of Marcos since 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 23 Feb, Marcos&rsquo;s defense minister Juan Ponce Enrile and the Armed Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen Fidel V. Ramos broke away from the hated regime, holing up in Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame with their followers. To protect them from attack by Marcos forces, people from all walks of life came in droves to EDSA, blocking main entries to the two camps. Using nonviolence as their weapon, the people made a vigil in EDSA. On 25 Feb, Corazon C. Aquino took her oath of office as president of the Republic of the Philippines. On the night of the same day, Marcos and his family were flown out by US planes to exile in Hawaii, ending a 14-year regime that was marked by authoritarian rule, massive plunder of the economy, and utter disregard for the constitutional rights of Filipino citizens. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

This was not, as many hoped, a short-term solution but dragged on until 1981, when Marcos, on paper, lifted martial law and called for the election of congress, which was by then a unicameral body, effected by the dissolution of the Senate through the 1972 constitution. Politically, economically, socially, and culturally all institutions were put under the government. Religious institutions, especially the Catholic Church, remained outside the direct control of government but were indirectly controlled through surveillance, the abduction and arrests of Church personnel, and the use of a carrot and stick tactic to keep the Churches under control."

Also of concern to the bishops and the right-leaning conservatives was the involvement of the clergy and nuns with militant groups under the National Democratic Front. The popularity of the Latin American theology of liberation, based on a Marxist perspective of society, was also troubling. So, martial law was seen as at least an ad hoc solution to the restlessness within the Church."

He did not seek to replicate the features of ethnic architecture but evoked it through the use of line and volume. His vertical arches that lifted a monolith echoed the houses on stilts of vernacular architecture. But, in keeping with modernity, he did not give the building a steep roof but rather hid the roof with a parapet. Locsin focused more on volume and overall shape as he did with the Folk Arts Theater and PICC. Locsin, however, kept the rough finish of his buildings, exposing the material for construction. The second approach represented by <a href=\"/2/2/2674\">Francisco Ma&#xF1;osa</a> and the architectural firm he had established was more literal. Ma&#xF1;osa had made a name for himself in the successful adaptation of the bahay kubo to urban residences. While having all the pleasing qualities of vernacular architecture&#x2014;the light filled interiors, the interaction between outdoor and indoor, the use of <a href=\"/2/6/253\">natural materials</a>, like stone and wood&#x2014;the residences were nonetheless modern with all the conveniences associated with contemporary living. He was commissioned to design a state guesthouse that would showcase Filipino identity and would use coconut and its by-products. Ma&#xF1;osa designed Tahanang Filipino more popularly known as Coconut Palace. He designed the units as hexagons, gave it a double roof reminiscent of the salakot, and used the swing-out or <strong>tukod</strong> window derived from the bahay kubo. The interiors were furnished with coconut, bamboo, rattan, <strong>capiz</strong> shells, textile, and an assortment of indigenous materials and textures, including tobacco."

The generation of this map was headed by DrCelso Roque. An area of 20,300 ha of prime agricultural land and forest was mapped out in Antipolo and in typical Imelda fashion, a pilot was built quickly and named Bagong Bayan (New Country), following the master plan of the Planning Resources Operations System (PROS) inaugurated in 1977. The model houses built were a contemporary adaptation of the bahay kubo. Raised from the ground by reinforced concrete stilts, the houses had steep roofs of galvanized iron sheets, a small balcony by the entrance, and steel casement windows. The houses were sited in separate family lots along a road system that followed the contour of the land.

Within a short period, the massive upgrading and building of five-star hotels sparked the building boom of the late 1970s."

Under the DOT were the Philippine Tourism Authority (PTA) and the Philippine Convention Bureau (PCB). The DOT became the Ministry of Tourism under the 1973 Constitution and reverted back to DOT in 1986 under Executive Order 120 and 120-A, signed by Pres Corazon Aquino. PTA was tasked with implementing policies and programs of DOT and developing, promoting, and supervising tourism projects. PTA established hostels and other forms of accommodations in potential tourist destinations that did not have sufficient infrastructure in the form of hotels and lodging houses. Among its projects were the Banaue Hotel, Youth Hostel, and Mount Data Hotel."

Among the Catholics, the traditional central role of the church building was questioned by the younger clergy who perceived that the challenge of the time was to rethink and reconfigure what Church as community should be. During this era, it was quite common for priests to celebrate Mass at venues other than the church or chapel. Masses took place in homes, hospitals, funeral parlors, and out in the open in picket lines and rallies, especially after 1983. The focus during this era was a return to the people. The basic ecclesial community movement brought the center of worship to the peripheries. Young priests were generally not keen about construction, looking at interest in such projects as pre-Vatican II."

				"value": "While there was a slowdown in church building, Catholic churches were built and those built during the Fourth Republic shared the vernacular aesthetics of Bagong Lipunan architecture. This was not in imitation of the prevalent style but rather arose from another impulse. The translation from Latin into the vernaculars of Church rites was in consonance with a theme of Vatican II to dialogue with culture. This dialogue was called &#x201C;inculturation,&#x201D; that is, the rooting of Christian doctrine and practice in cultures other than the dominant culture of the West. Experimenting with indigenous material, motifs, shapes, and colors, both designers and clerics sought to integrate Philippine cultural expression with Catholic faith. A visible pioneer in this path was Fr Ruben Villote. Assigned to Tipas, a barrio of Taguig, Rizal in 1969, four years after Vatican II, he built the parish not by building a church but organizing the church community. Tipas had an adobe Spanish era chapel but Tipas was a poor community of fisherfolk, farmers, and poultry raisers. Not having resources, Villote decorated the church with the ingenious bamboo creations of artisans of the community. Named Dambanang Kawayan, it was a pioneer in the use of local material and the adaptation of vernacular aesthetics to church design."

Although made of reinforced concrete and galvanized roof, the structures were small, had open sides, which could be grilled, a facade and sanctuary. Decorated with store-bought, mass-produced statuary and art work, these chapels did not always have the benefit of an architect or designer. Typical of these churches is San Nicolas de Tolentino built in 1975, in Congressional Subdivision, Quezon City. Its facade of bricks is nondescript. A cement cross is the only ornament."

The triangles are crossed by horizontals evoking the shape of a terraced hill. The interior reflects the exterior with the triangles leading the eye upward. The interior, like the exterior, is finished in concrete. The interior is embellished with a wooden sculpture of the Risen Christ.

The INC style allows a certain diversity within basic forms. The apparent uniformity of style could be understood to signify solidarity or a common single-mindedness. In fact, such uniformity heightens the visibility and ubiquity of a minority church. The Mormon Meeting House used spires and other elements like tall windows from gothic."

The government justified the establishment of PAGCOR by saying that it brought revenue to the government, second only tothe Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). PAGCOR operated because of its strict laws about gambling and because many of its casinos were operated in the context of a hotel, one of which was Hilton Manila.

The farmers could not afford the input needed for rice production and the government was unable to set up an effective system of financing the emancipated tenants.

If Imelda was able to make what had come to be known as &#x201C;Imeldific&#x201D; projects, this was made possible because of foreign loans. As the government found it necessary to borrow in order to finance its building and infrastructure projects, the Philippines&#x2019;s foreign loans had mushroomed toward the end of the Fourth Republic.

On the evening of 22 Feb, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Chief of Staff Gen Fidel Ramos declared that they were abandoning Pres Ferdinand Marcos and had called on the military loyal to the Republic to gather at the adjoining camps, Crame and Aguinaldo, along Epifanio de los Santos Ave (EDSA). At nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, Jaime Cardinal Sin, through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4824\">Radio Veritas</a>, urged civilians to go to EDSA and station themselves between the camps. Although the call seemed unwise and foolish, by Sunday morning the crowd had increased to the hundred thousands and, by noon of 23 Feb, Enrile crossed EDSA to consolidate his loyal troops with those of Ramos. The Veritas transmitter went dead&mdash;sabotaged, it was believed, by Marcos&rsquo;s troops. But from an unknown source, known only as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4822\">Radio Bandido</a>, broadcasts supportive of the events happening at EDSA were aired nationwide. Gatherings and protests like EDSA were repeated in major cities like Cebu and Davao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marcos and Aquino each had their own presidential oath-takings&mdash;Aquino at the Club Filipino and Marcos at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a>&mdash;while the crowd at EDSA had swollen to hundreds of thousands. There were more military defections to Ramos and Enrile and, by the evening of 26 Feb, the tide of popular support had turned. Marcos and his family left Malaca&ntilde;an, airlifted and eventually ending at Clark Field, where the family and others who followed went to Hawaii in exile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The euphoria of Marcos&rsquo;s departure was soon replaced by the hard task of rebuilding. Aquino took steps to return to pre-martial law democracy. After appointing cabinet members, governors, and mayors to their positions, she set forth to create a Constitutional Commission which by 1987 had finished its task. Ratified by a plebiscite, the 1987 Philippine Constitution set the stage for reinstating elections and other institutions of Philippine democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Aquino Presidency, 1986</strong> &ndash; <strong>92.</strong> The administration of Corazon C. Aquino saw the decline of Bagong Lipunan architecture. Many building projects created by Imelda went under scrutiny by the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). Some projects turned out not to have been paid for or had extensive loans from local agencies. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) took over the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, built with a loan from GSIS which had not been paid. Other projects, like Imelda&rsquo;s resort in Olot, Fort Ilocandia, and the Marcos house in Batac, fell under government investigation. University of Life went into a decline. The Santo Ni&ntilde;o Shrine in Tacloban was padlocked and remained unused until it was damaged by Typhoon Yolanda in Nov 2013. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> and the Makiling High School for the Arts continued to exist. Both had good management teams to see them through the transition to the Fifth Republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aquino opted not to reside in Malaca&ntilde;an, choosing instead as presidential residence a guesthouse of the palace on Arlegui St, an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> residence built before World War II. After repairing Malaca&ntilde;an, which was slightly damaged by the onslaught of people who entered the premises in the euphoria of People Power and after the palace furnishings had been properly inventoried, Aquino opened Malaca&ntilde;an as a museum that showed the opulence and decadence of the Marcos era. Under Aquino, the former San Miguel Brewery, acquired during the Marcos era, was refurbished to serve as the new Executive House. The 1921 Executive House was renamed Kalayaan Hall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1987, Aquino established the Presidential Commission for Culture and the Arts (PCCA), predecessor of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a>, to oversee the art and culture field. In the CCP, a new team took over, reorganized the center to serve all the arts except architecture, and pursued the thrusts of Filipinization, democratization, and decentralization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Aquino presidency was plagued with many difficulties. The government was bankrupt. The national debt was increasing and the economy was in bad state. A series of brownouts signaled the problems left by the Marcos era. The Aquino presidency was beset by coup d&rsquo;etat attempts by military factions which had supported her bid for presidency but were critical of the slow pace that she took to achieve the reform she had promised. Factions still loyal to Marcos, especially from his political bailiwick in the Ilocos, launched protests against Aquino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although it was not a good time for architecture, the regime managed to address the need for improving roads and building flyovers to ease traffic in and out of Manila and set the stage for future development by signing into law the creation of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA). Republic Act (RA) 7227, BCDA, was signed on 13 Mar 1992, a few months before the next presidential election. Although RA 7227 was amended by RA 7917 in 1995 and by RA 9400 in 2007, the rationale for the act remained. BCDA was an instrument of government with corporate powers &ldquo;mandated to transform former US military bases into alternative productive civilian use&rdquo; (http://www.bcda.gov.ph/). BCDA contributed to the modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and worked towered socio-economic development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ramos Presidency, 1992</strong> &ndash; <strong>98.</strong> The building boom came later, during the presidency of Fidel Ramos. Ramos, who succeeded Aquino, restored Malaca&ntilde;an to its former function by returning to Malaca&ntilde;an and using Marcos&rsquo;s office. He repaired the palace, which had been damaged by typhoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the strongest effect of the Ramos presidency was opening the Philippine economy to more foreign investments under the aegis of greater regional cooperation. Under Ramos, BCDA moved forward. The Americans, who had left their bases at Subic Bay and Clark Field after they were devastated by the eruption of Mt Pinatubo on 15 Jun 1991, left behind large tracts of land leased from the Philippines but which had expired. The Philippines did not renew the lease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subic and Clark were contiguous to each other and were damaged by heavy ash fall. The recreational Camp John Hay in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a> was returned to the Philippines with the exit of the American military. Under Ramos, these former American bases were opened for developers who would sign contracts for 25 years to develop the place following terms set by law. The amendments to the law allowed the redevelopment of other military bases. Aside from Subic, Clark, and John Hay, BCDA covers the Bataan Technology Park, Poro Point, Fort Bonifacio, and Villamor Airbase. Because it was located in the area of Metro Manila (NCR), straddling Makati City and Taguig City, Fort Bonifacio (formerly McKinley), is the most visible area of development. The conversion of the bases and other government lands became the focus of the government&rsquo;s development project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government derived income from the sale or rental of these large facilities to private investors, and with money from foreign investors, created virtually new cities made up of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">high rise buildings</a>. High-rises of multiple use were the buildings of choice because of the rising value of real estate, especially of properties near or within the ambit of the metropolis. The government also launched a BOT (build-operate-transfer) scheme where an investor was allowed to develop public land and property for a set period like 25 years, enough time to recoup investment and make profit. Thenthe development would revert to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Aquino presidency, a privatization program was initiated with the sale of 122 government-owned companies, bringing the Philippine government $2 billion. Under Ramos, privatization was expanded into infrastructure. To solve the recurring electrical shortages and resulting brownouts, Ramos moved to privatize the generation and distribution of electricity from 1992 to 1994. Seeing the success of this scheme, the next to be privatized was the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System (MWSS), a government entity established before World War II. MWSS went into partnership with Manila Water and Maynilad in 1997 to upgrade and expand the distribution system of water in Metro Manila, Cavite, and Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic growth characterized the Ramos years and spurred confidence that the Philippines was now on the road to recovery. New developments and new buildings rose not only in Manila but also in the provinces. Development was undertaken by large real estate companies. In the lead was Ayala, which had a long history of real estate development. They were among the first to locate at Fort Bonifacio, which was adjacent to Forbes Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other developers entered the market. SM created SM Development Corporation (SMDC). The Robinson&rsquo;s group, Villar, Fil Estate, Millennium and many more realty and architectural development companies invested in the bases. Much of development was controlled by large corporations that could bring in foreign investors and had the means to market to foreign buyers, like Filipinos living abroad or to foreign companies that were looking for a base in Southeast Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Ramos, a 17-hectare development in Bagumbayan or Libis, Quezon City was launched in 1997. This would be known as Eastwood City. Within the development is Cyberpark, an information technology (IT) center approved by the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA). An agency under the Department of Trade and Industry, PEZA was enacted under RA 7916, and signed into law by Ramos in 1995. PEZA is mandated to promote investment in export-oriented industry in the country and to assist investors. It facilitates the establishment of IT companies in business processing outsourcing (BPO) and in knowledge processing outsourcing. It also encourages the establishment of special economic zones of businesses in tourism, medical tourism, logistics and warehousing, and economic zone development and operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest government-sponsored project was the construction of the Centennial Park in Clark Field, Pampanga, built during the Ramos presidency. Set to open in 1996 to commemorate the centennial of the Philippine Revolution, the park consisted of manmade islands and water features that combined elements of a museum with a theme park. The Centennial Park was a white elephant. It was not completed and very few went to the park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippines, through the able fiscal management of the Ramos regime, sailed through the Asian economic crisis of 1992, unlike neighboring parts of Southeast Asiawhere the economic bubble burst that sent most of the region in a downward spin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Estrada Presidency, 1998</strong> &ndash; <strong>2001.</strong> The presidency was brief, a little more than two years, 30 Jun 1998 to 20 Jan 2001. Ramos&rsquo;s successor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">Joseph Estrada</a> decided to take residence at the Premier Guest House and improved it as a residence and office. The interior of Malaca&ntilde;an was refurbished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Estrada presidency was not able to hold on to the economic gains of the Ramos era. Riddled with charges of corruption and plunder and criticized for its informal style of governing, Estrada soon found himself the subject of an impeachment proceeding but resigned from office before the trial could conclude. He was ousted from power by People Power II when the impeachment court decided not to present vital evidence against Estrada and massive protests against Estrada gained momentum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite its brevity, it was under Estrada&rsquo;s administration that Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) 2 was completed and inaugurated. This project began during the Ramos presidency. But soon after the inauguration, Estrada was embroiled in controversy connected with this very project because he awarded the use of the new terminal to Philippine Airlines, whose majority stockholder, Lucio Tan, was said to be one of Estrada&rsquo;s supporters. Although the law creating PEZA was signed by Ramos in 1997, it is to Estrada&rsquo;s credit that the Philippines became a major player in the emerging business process outsourcing (BPO), popularly known as &ldquo;call centers.&rdquo; It was during his presidency that the Eastwood City became operational. It was the prototype of the cyber city that was to emerge at Fort Bonifacio and the provinces of the Visayas, like Iloilo, Bacolod, and Cebu, and of Mindanao, like Davao, and cities like Baguio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arroyo Presidency, 2001</strong> &ndash; <strong>10.</strong> Upon Estrada&rsquo;s resignation, vice-president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo took office as president, as mandated by law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With great effort and sound management, Arroyo was able to slow down the economic decline of the Estrada years. As in the Estrada years, government was not into architecture, although Arroyo renovated Malaca&ntilde;an, cleaning out the personal effects of the Marcos family and turning them over to the PCGG. She had a Presidential Briefing Room similar to the White House Situation Room built. She recovered historic furniture, restored Kalayaan Hall, and spruced up the garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arroyo focused on projects that would spur economic growth, so her regime was known for increasing infrastructure, like improving roads, building new highways, and opening sea lanes by integrating roll on-roll off (RoRo) shipping through the improvement of ports and the construction of new ones. Arroyo left a master plan for infrastructure improvement, which included the rehabilitation and expansion of the railroad system, a task given to Vice-Pres Noli de Castro; the expansion of the North Luzon and South Luzon Expressways (NLEX and SLEX) connecting Metro Manila with the provinces; the construction of the Manila Bay highway, a project that was in the original <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Burnham</a> plan for Manila; and the development of areas surrounding the NCR. Under her many infrastructure projects were launched, including the upgrade of NLEX and SLEX, the construction of NAIA III and similar airport projects in the Visayas and Mindanao, like the new airports at Santa Barbara, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/420\">Iloilo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/425\">Silay City</a>, Negros Occidental, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/430\">Zamboanga City</a>, and the Cagayan de Oro airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Arroyo, part of the military base fronting NAIA III was redeveloped as Resorts World, a complex consisting of a hotel, casino, stores, restaurants, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">movie houses</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a>. It was inaugurated in 2009 and was the first of the casino resorts to be built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Benigno Aquino III Presidency, 2010</strong> - <strong>16.</strong> The first two years of Benigno Aquino&rsquo;s presidency was marked by a slowdown in government-sponsored projects. Working with a program of &ldquo;Daang Matuwid,&rdquo; a slogan addressing corruption, Aquino had the infrastructure programs of Arroyo scrutinized. This meant that very little was done during the first two years of his administration. NAIA III went under review. The rehabilitation of the northern track of a railroad system that was to connect Manila with the Ilocos was a dead project. The contract for the railroad was allegedly flawed and China which was to be a partner in developing the railroad was no longer with the project. Informal settlers began to slowly return to the land that had been cleared for the railroad&rsquo;s right of way. The building and expansion of piers and harbors&mdash;part of Arroyo&rsquo;s scheme to promote and develop roro shipping&mdash;was put on hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only after this period of examination did the government continue with projects that had been in the works since Arroyo. Under Aquino, NAIA III, which had been embroiled in controversy with contractors, became partially operational by 2008, and fully operational in 2011. Projects like road development, which had been developed under Arroyo, continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the cultural field, the Aquino administration invested heavily in the upgrading and expansion of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>. With Aquino, the old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a>, which housed the office of the Prime Minister called Executive House under Marcos, was turned over totally to the National Museum. Following a master plan drawn during the Ramos regime, the Legislative Building became the National Museum&rsquo;s Museum of Fine Arts. The Department of Tourism building (in pre-World War II period, the Department of Agriculture building) was turned over to the National Museum to turn into a Museum of Natural History, to be completed in 2017. Other museum branches were repaired, upgraded, and built. The Batanes Museum was built in a former American military base on Batan Island. Convention centers, like that of Iloilo City, were also completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Aquino presidency, two integrated resort and casino complexes were opened in a 120-ha reclamation area of Manila Bay within the jurisdiction of Para&ntilde;aque. Solaire opened in 2013 and City of Dreams in 2015. Both developments are within the Entertainment City of the Philippine Amusement Gaming Corporation (PAGCOR) which was designated as a special economic zone by PEZA under a presidential proclamation in 2009 by Pres Arroyo. Solaire started construction in Jun 2010. The first phase completed in 2013 was inaugurated with Pres Aquino in attendance. City of Dreams, which had a sister company in Macau, rests on a 6.2-hectare property; it opened in Feb 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Globalization and Architectural Development.</strong> Globalization as a process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, ideas, products, labor, capital and other resources has its antecedents in the 19th century when imperialist nations dominated and exploited Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Advances in transportation and communication facilitated this domination. With the revolutions for independence, the Western empires collapsed but the newly independent nations were integrated into a web of exchange&mdash; economic, social, and cultural. In the 20th century, globalization grew at an increasingly fast pace as advances in container ships, fast trains, jet liners, and the development of mobile phones and the internet built a more connected world. In 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) defined four basic aspects of globalization: capital and investment movements, trade and transactions, migration, and knowledge dissemination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closely allied to globalization is transnationalism or transnationalization. In economic terms, it involves the organization of production, where various stages of production take place in various countries to cut cost and maximize productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Green or sustainable architecture, while not representing a specific style, is a global movement that grew out of the rising concern about the environment and its degradation due to human activity. Its origins are in the energy crisis and environmental pollution in the United States in the 1960s and the 1970s. Rachel Carson&rsquo;s <em><strong>Silent Spring</strong></em>, 1962, is considered as the first to articulate sustainable development with green architecture. With the spread of the environment movement from the United States to the rest of the world grew the movement of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">&ldquo;green architecture,&rdquo;</a> which sought to mitigate the effects of architecture on the environment. The move was to reduce the use of energy in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">construction</a>, maintenance, and use of the building. Also of concern were how <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">materials</a> were used, how they were extracted, how much energy was used to make them or what their &ldquo;carbon footprint&rdquo; was, and whether the materials used&mdash;whether natural or composite made in factories&mdash;had an adverse effect on the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These initiatives of green architecture were preventive or curative but a more active phase of green architecture looked into the generation of power through alternative means like solar energy, the increase of green spaces through lighted interiors that allowed the cultivation of plants known to purify the air, and by rooftop and vertical gardens. A local green architecture evaluation and certification group is Berde. An international certification group is LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design). Both are actively working to evaluate buildings and rate them. LEED uses a standard symbolized by precious metals, platinum being the highest rating given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Philippine Response to International Trends.</strong> Much of the architectural development at this time fell to the private business sector. In general, since the Ramos administration, government has left business to take care of itself concentrating its interventions indirectly, through tax cuts and investments initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the development of digital technology and other means of communication, the Filipinos&rsquo; proficiency in English and their ability to mimic various English accents, the Philippines took the lead in the international market in offering BPO services. This spurred the growth of the Ortigas Business Center and Libis in the boundaries of Quezon City and Manila. C5, the fifth of Metro Manila&rsquo;s circumferential road, linked Libis, Ortigas, The Fort and the international airport, and became a corridor of development and high-rises. Some high-rises were offices, many for call centers, others residences, and still others for mixed use with parking at the basement or above ground, retail outlets, restaurants and convenience stores at the ground, office spaces in the lower stories, and residences at the upper stories. A common configuration was to limit retail spaces and offices to a podium, whose roof was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscaped</a> as a garden, and to build a residential tower above the podium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the Philippines was opening to a global market, the construction of an &ldquo;iconic building,&rdquo; designed by a world-renowned architect to attract international investors became attractive. Iconic refers to a building which is unique in design and has the stamp of its creator, an internationally known and admired architect. Although Michael Graves had antedated him in a project at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, American Chinese architect I. M. Pei&rsquo;s Essensa Towers, a residential high-rise for the high-end market at Fort Bonifacio was seen as a first in a series of iconic buildings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clients or developers justified hiring foreign consultants or architects on the grounds that the needed expertise for design and construction was not locally available. A local firm would form a partnership with a foreign company and in this way internationally known architects and firms entered the Philippines. Such firms and their projects include Michael Graves, World Trade Exchange, 1996, in Binondo; I. M. Pei (Pei, Cobb, Freed &amp; Partners), Essensa Towers, 2001; KPF (Kohn, Pendersen, and Fox), LKG Tower, 1998; and SOM (Skidmore, Owings and Merril), Yuchengco Towers, 2001. Other foreign firms that partnered with Filipinos are HOK (Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum), Gensler, NBBJ, RTLK, and Arquitectura (Lico 2008, 510).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Globalization also meant that the new buildings had to be up to international standards. To ensure that quality, the Ayala Corp. had its own core of engineers and contractors, and soon other companies like SM and Villar had their own. These companies either had in-house teams of architects, engineers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscape designers</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/215\">interior designers</a> or worked with a set team. It had its own workforce of licensed plumbers, electricians, carpenters, painters, and a host of manual laborers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Styles and Postmodernism.</strong> While the Philippines was going through political upheavals in the 1970s, there was a different upheaval in architecture. Although its conceptual origins can be traced to the late 1950s and 1960s, when its early pioneer, Robert Venturi, reintroduced the split gable in the Vanna Venturi house in 1964 and wrote a critique of modern architecture, postmodernism did not become a movement until the 1970s when postmodernist architecture came to prominence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Postmodernism</a> is the term used to define a worldview that has turned away from modernism&rsquo;s accent on rationality, professionalization, industrialization, urbanization, secularization, order, and hierarchy in the newly formed nation-state, capitalism,and the market economy. Belief in constant change that leads to progress was a key element in the modern mindset. This was the guiding philosophy of Europe before World War II, buoyed by spectacular growth brought about by science and technology. But philosophers critiqued the possibility of absolute and total knowledge, and the claims of positivist science and philosophies like Marxism, which saw the inexorable progress from capitalism to socialism to communism. World War II and the detonation of the atomic bomb at Hiroshima and Nagasaki shook the world&rsquo;s confidence in inevitable progress. The era after World War II culminating in the 1980s is seen as the last phase of modernism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postmodernism in architecture or postmodernist architecture does not represent one style&mdash;it is rather a perspective on architecture that has embraced a host of styles. Postmodernist architects regarded modern architecture as lacking in soul and imagination and unable to achieve the Utopia it promised. Working from Le Corbusier&rsquo;s concept of a building as a machine for living, its attempted harmony of form and function, and the dismissal of ornament, the modernist strain produced boxy edifices which looked like clones of each other. The postmodernist wanted to return wit and ornament and to return architecture to its roots by referencing historical architecture. One of its vocal theoreticians, Venturi, coined the saying &ldquo;less is a bore&rdquo; in response to modernist Ludwig Mies van der Rohe &ldquo;less is more.&rdquo; Early examples of postmodernism are Michael Graves&rsquo; Portland Bldg and Philip Johnson&rsquo;s Sony Bldg (formerly AT&amp;T) in New York. Instead of the flat roof of modernism, it used a broken pediment derived from classicism. It also adapted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Renaissance</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Baroque</a> periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An early example of postmodernism in the Philippines is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2660\">Gabriel Formoso</a>&rsquo;s Pacific Star Building, in Makati, completed in 1990. While distinctively modern, Pacific Star evokes the past by paying homage to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Roman</a> arch, and does so with refinement and grace. Other postmodern buildings are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2707\">Rogelio Villarosa</a>&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s Court, 1990, Tektite Tower, 1995, and Renaissance Tower, 1995; Felino Palafox&rsquo;s Nueva Ecija Capitol at Palayan City, 2003; and Dewey Santos and Felix Ngo&rsquo;s designs for Metrobank branches (beginning in the late 1990s), where no two branches are alike. Ritcheto Alcordo&rsquo;s Waterfront Hotel in Lahug Cebu, 1998, has turrets making it resemble a cartoon-like fairy tale castle. Sanctuarium, 2006, the largest <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">columbarium</a> in the Philippines, has a temple facade surmounted by a translucent dome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postmodernism had its impact on residential styles. Following the eclecticism of postmodern architectures, new developments, especially in vacation areas like Tagaytay, followed a theme development plan, landscaping, and architecture. Designs could derive from the Swiss chalet, the Greek residences of Santorini, Mediterranean, or Mexican houses, especially in its palette of contrasting, vibrant colors. There was a market for such styles as Filipinos traveled for leisure or as overseas workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A popular style of residential architecture has been described as &ldquo;Zen.&rdquo; These are modernist and postmodernist structures characterized by straight lines and restrained color schemes, usually earth-brown, black, white, and gray. Zen architecture modernizes many of the elements of the traditional Philippine house with its expanses of large windows, overhangs, and an interaction between the outdoors and indoors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Postmodernism has been criticized, especially by the modernist, as being eclectic, filled with useless ornaments, and elements that have no function, therefore a needless expense and waste. It has also been described as stick-on-style: that is, a modernist building may be clad with precast ornaments or faux stones that quote some historical style. What began as an avant-garde movement has unfortunately been appropriated in designs that &ldquo;seldom had the finesse and beauty of the original for they were reduced to an eclectic visual feast processed in the name of populism and consumerism,&rdquo; writes Lico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the qualities of good architecture are undermined in poorly planned projects, the postmodern creative spirit has shaped the Philippine architecture of the 1990s and the first two decades of the 21st century.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"forms\" name=\"forms\"></a>Forms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dwellings and Residences.</strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">High-rise condominiums</a> and gated communities are characteristic of the Fifth Republic era. High-rise condominiums were already built during the Fourth Republic and gated subdivisions emerged during the post-World War II era. What characterizes the Fifth Republic condominiums are their height and proliferation, and the gated communities, their more comprehensive planning and proliferation as new &ldquo;villages&rdquo; were built farther away from Metro Manila&rsquo;s center. Quezon City, Valenzuela City, Laguna, and Cavite were all sites of development. In the provinces, Cebu&rsquo;s development sprawled south to Talisay and north to Liloan. Iloilo&rsquo;s development moved north toward Pavia. Cagayan de Oro&rsquo;s development spread across the highway that linked Cagayan with Iligan and Gingoog. Davao&rsquo;s sprawl moved north following the Pan-Philippine Highway, through Matina, Lanang, and the direction of the Davao International Airport, and toward Talomo and Dumoy. Baguio also opened new developments in Asin for instance and large tracks of land like Camp John Hay and Brent School have been the centers of development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the gated community concept remains essentially the same as it was in the 1960s, namely, a self-contained community secured by walls and gates, what distinguished the new developments were: first, they were developed following an economic scale from low-end to high-end; and second, unlike in the 1960s, where house lots were sold, many developments followed the Philamlife model where pre-existing houses were built and priced accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mass Housing.</strong> The government continued to face the problem of growing population and the need for mass housing. While government continued with projects to build low-cost housing during the Fifth Republic era, private groups became active in upgrading and building low-cost housing. The Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) initiated housing projects for its members, for instance, in Rodriguez (formerly Montalban), Rizal. Habitat for Humanity has been active in housing. Gawad Kalinga, a local organization, has also been working with mass housing. Entering a shanty village, Gawad Kalinga first organizes the people, especially the men who are invited to help in building better houses, through &ldquo;sweat equity,&rdquo; that is offering free labor in exchange for better houses. Houses are sponsored by donors like schools and companies, and individual donors. The building blocks of the houses like beams and hollow blocks are prepared in the area with the cooperation of the residents. Gawad Kalinga houses are known for their colorful exteriors and for the common facilities, like a hall for meetings and for communal work. Gawad Kalinga has also launched a livelihood program to help in the upkeep of the residences built and help uplift the poor communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Government Office Buildings.</strong> With the devolution of governance to the local government, the national government has not built much. When the Senate was convened in accordance with the 1987 constitution that reinstated the bicameral legislature, the lower house went to the Batasang Pambansa and the upper house eventually to the GSIS building in the reclamation area along Manila Bay. The old Legislative building was turned over to the National Museum, as well as the nearby buildings known in the pre-World War II era as Agriculture and Finance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The local government was more active in building. New city halls were built, in places like Urdaneta, Pangasinan, and the old city hall was converted to other uses like museums. Felino Palafox Jr&rsquo;s design for the Nueva Ecija Capitol at Palayan City works with a severe interpretation of classicism with its arched windows and pillars. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2647\">William<strong> </strong>Coscolluela</a> designed the new Iloilo Capitol in harmony with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/227\">heritage</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\">Capitol</a> near it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Schools.</strong> Private <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a> were in the forefront of developing new campuses outside the metropolis. San Juan de Letran, Brent School, Xavier School, Miriam (formerly Maryknoll), and Lyceum are some of the schools that have opened or are opening satellite campuses near or within new developments like Nuvali along the Santa Rosa-Tagaytay road. New schools like STI, AMA, Adventist, and others have also opened countryside campuses.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The trend is not limited to Metro Manila as provincial schools seek larger campuses, like Sacred Heart School in Cebu, which moved from its crowded midtown Cebu campus to Mandaue and Xavier University in Cagayan de Oro, which developed a new campus plus housing in the uplands of Cagayan in the direction of the former Lumbia Airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These countryside campuses, like Lyceum at Laguna, Batangas, and Cavite, offer the advantage of a wide campus opened to the countryside. Formerly Lyceum Institute of Technology, Lyceum Batangas was incorporated on 18 Jan 2000. Encompassing five colleges and an international school, Lyceum Cavite Campus in General Trias, established in 2008, is dubbed as the &ldquo;first and only resort campus&rdquo; in the Philippines because it integrates <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscaping</a> with the campus design. Gardens and pools are integral to the complex. The complex&rsquo;s design is derived from the laurel leaf, a reference to the Laurel family who established the Lyceum chain. The leaf design is expressed in a canopy of curving roofs that serve as a shield against sun and rain for the buildings underneath. This canopy is supported by a steel structure independent of the building. In spirit it is postmodern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hospitals.</strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">Hospitals</a> have likewise built new structures like the Medical City on Ortigas Ave, St Luke&rsquo;s with its branch at The Fort, Cardinal Santos in San Juan, and the Asian Hospital along the SLEX. In the provinces, Cebu Doctors Hospital and Maria Reyna in Cagayan de Oro have also upgraded and built new structures. These hospitals vary in design; most are modernist, but what is common among them are the integration of new equipment and modern methods of health care and the effort to make a hospital more appealing to patients. Newer hospitals give an impression of being more like a hotel rather than a place for the infirm. Amenities such as fast-food outlets, mini-groceries, pharmacies, and an independent medical arts building for outpatients are included in the design. Depending on one&rsquo;s budget, room choices can be simple like wards or suites like those in five-star hotels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hospitals are developing in response to advances in medicine and healthcare, especially of the aging. Also, hospital tourism is becoming common in Asia with foreigners coming to Asian hospitals for treatment or elective surgery that might be prohibitive in cost in their home country. So the atmosphere of going on vacation is best maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Commercial and Related Buildings.</strong> As of 1992, high-rise buildings in Makati and Mandaluyong have reached close to or beyond 140 m. The Pacific Plaza Condominium in Makati rises to 43 stories or 130.9 m above ground level and has a four-and-a-half level basement for parking. The Palladium Summit Condominium in Mandaluyong is 138 m high and has 46 stories. The Rufino Tower, an office building in Makati, is 150 m high, including radio antenna, and has 42 stories. Fast becoming a forest of skyscrapers is Pasig, which began to develop more rapidly in the mid-1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the newer commercial buildings are rising in the new developments: in Mandaluyong and Pasig at the Ortigas Center and at the old site of the Rizal Capitol, at the former Fort Bonifacio and along South Luzon Expressway, from Alabang to Santa Rosa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stores, superstores, malls, and hotels continue to be built. Conceptually they are developments of the Fourth Republic architecture. What has characterized the Fifth Republic architecture is scale. Stores, superstores, and malls have become bigger, and are being called &ldquo;mega.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New clubhouses built in new gated villages combine a restaurant, an area for banquets and meetings, and sports facilities. Independent clubhouses apart from gated villages have also been built or upgraded like the Capitol Sports Club.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Churches.</strong> The creative impulse released by inculturation and Vatican II&rsquo;s reform of the liturgy set the conditions for exploring the vernacular and the natural in Catholic church design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Mary Immaculate Parish Church in Moonwalk Subdivision, Las Pi&ntilde;as, designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2674\">Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa</a> and completed in 1988, is a tent open on all sides. The roof hangs from cables attached to concrete pylons, and is lined within by chemically treated anahaw leaves. The dove-shaped lamps hanging from the ceilings are of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>capiz</strong></a> (windowpane oysters).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Hacienda Rosalia at Manapla, Negros Occidental, Fr Luis Gaston built a church using discarded cartwheels. The church is unique for being made of recycled materials. It is in the neo-vernacular style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Benedictine Monastery Chapel of the Transfiguration in Malaybalay is the last major work of National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>. Here he returns to the open church design he first used in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice</a> in the University of the Philippines, but instead of a circular plan, he worked with a square plan. He placed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">altar</a> at one side of the square plan and covered the floor area with a pyramidal roof evocative of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut) or the Ifugao<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>fale</strong> (house). Set on the cool plateau of Bukidnon, the church harmonizes with the surroundings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some churches may be described as postmodern. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Zamboanga City designed by Abarro and Associates, 1998-2002, was built to replace the old cathedral made of wood dating to the post-World War II years. The new cathedral drew its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/254\">design</a> concept from the image of bundles of candles standing upright that devotees traditionally place on stands as votive offerings. The sculptural cathedral shows postmodernism&rsquo;s tendency to find inspiration from various sources, not just architectural works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renamed Pedro Calungsod Chapel, after the beatification of San Pedro Calungsod was celebrated at the SM Seaside City in Talisay, Cebu, the chapel is by US-based architect Carlos Arnaiz. Sitting on a half-hectare property within SM&rsquo;s development, the chapel was donated by the Sy Family to the Archdiocese of Cebu. Arnaiz designed the chapel in a sculptural manner using as a design element 100 freestanding vertical walls connected by tall expanses of glass windows in casement frames. The main chapel is complemented by a Chapel for the Blessed Sacrament and outdoor stations of the cross. The whole complex sits above a cement podium, with spaces underneath for other uses. The chapel echoes the designs of Mexican architect Luis Ramiro Barrag&aacute;n Mort&iacute;n, who works with tall sheer walls as a design element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2668\">Gerard Lico</a> coined the phrase &ldquo;ecclesiastical eccentricity&rdquo; to describe churches that do not fit neatly into traditional forms and models of churches. The term was not limited to Catholic churches but included Protestant churches. As examples, Lico cites the neo-modernist Church of the Ges&ugrave;, 2002, of the Ateneo de Manila University designed by Jose Pedro Recio and Carmelo Casas based on the pyramid; the New Millennium Evangelical Church, 2003, which resembles a six-story office building except for having a corner which tapers like a bell tower and terminates in a cross; and the Ampoanan sa Kalinaw ug Kinaadman, 2002, in the botanical garden of Southwestern University in Cebu, designed by National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3376\">Napoleon V. Abueva</a>. The last is more a piece of monumental and kinetic sculpture than a building (Lico 2008, 538&ndash;42).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the neo-vernacular, modern, and the postmodern designs is a visible return to tradition that can be called neobaroque. This trend began in the 1980s, when churches, which were otherwise modern began building <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a> in the baroque style. Such projects were spurred most likely by a reaction to post-Vatican II church designs which were straightforward and functional. A common complaint was these churches did not look Catholic; they looked Protestant. The root of this trend was modernism&rsquo;s adage &ldquo;form follows function.&rdquo; Post-Vatican II church design placed the celebration of Church rites at the center and the church building was subservient to these rites. In the modernist idiom, the church came alive when there was a celebration, otherwise it was an empty shell. But parishioners and devotees who had grown up with the opulence of baroque in old churches found the spaces dead and unappealing. Soon these rather empty churches were filled with statuary and other objects of devotion, placed in a baroque retablo inside a modernist church. Examples are found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/262\">Antipolo Cathedral</a> and the Sacred Heart Parish Church in Kamuning, Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cupola of St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica in Rome was copied by St Peter&rsquo;s Parish Church, established 1993. This church on Commonwealth Ave has a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical</a> portico, reminiscent of the Madeleine in France. St Peter&rsquo;s dome is also used by the Santa Rita de Montefalco church in Pasig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New neobaroque churches were built. Publicly accessible examples are St James Parish in Alabang and the Archdiocesan Shrine of Jesus the Way, the Truth and the Life, built in 1995 near SM&rsquo;s Mall of Asia. The Opus Dei built a chapel in the neobaroque style in Makati inside an office building, which is said to have been the prototype for the development of St James.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mega church is a new development with roots in Evangelical Churches in the United States. A mega church is a worship space that can accommodate 2000 people or more for a service. A well-known example is the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Orange County, California, in the US. The reflective glass building, designed by American architect Philip Johnson, was completed in 1981 and seats 2,736 people. It was built for the Reformed Church in America founded by Dr. Robert H. Schuller in 1955. The cathedral was under the Reformed Church from 1981 to 2012. After the death of Dr Schuller, it was acquired by the Roman Catholic Church, as Schuller&rsquo;s church was bankrupt and could not pay its debts. The church is undergoing renovation to be transformed into the &ldquo;Christ Cathedral&rdquo; of the Diocese of Orange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From its evangelical beginnings, similar structures have been built in the Philippines, not necessarily by evangelicals but by TV preachers and churches that have large followings. El Shaddai founder Mike Velarde inaugurated a one billion peso House of Prayer on a 10-hectare property at Amvel City, San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque. The building is 10,000 sqm with a 16,000 seating capacity and additional standing room for 25,000. It is shaped as two large concave halls intersecting each other and crowned by a glass pyramid at the center. Evangelical preacher Apollo Quiboloy broke ground in 2012 for a 50,000-seat indoor cathedral, called King Dome along the Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway, near the Davao airport. The project was expected to be finished in 2015. Externally, the dome resembles a sports stadium. On 17 Aug 2011, the INC broke ground for the Philippine Arena, completed on 27 Jul 2014, the centennial of the INC. Built on 7.5 ha of land, the dome measures 3.6 ha and about 60 m or 15 stories high.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The structure is no longer called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>sambahan</strong></a> or <strong>kapilya</strong>. It is a dome because, architecturally, it is a large sports stadium. The difference is that the stage, which can also be used for indoor sports, will be to one side of the dome and not in the center as expected. The off-center stage allows the use of the dome for services, concerts and other events, local or international.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether they adhere to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">revivalist styles</a> or experiment with modern, postmodern, or contemporary design, the buildings of the Catholic Church and some Protestant churches, are characterized by diversity and individuality, and attest to the freedom that is possible within the framework of faith. While the INC churches work with its own brand of the gothic, churches of the 21st century have integrated designs incorporating the Roman arch and cast concrete embellishments in facades of a more decorative style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever be its outward form or style, the church is expected not only to provide space for worship but to inspire worship. The architecture of an epoch is an expression of its values and aspirations. Future generations viewing the church architecture of our time will judge whether or not this was a golden age of the spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Theaters and Cinemas.</strong> Equipped with escalators to carry large crowds, the new movie houses have moved up from street level to the upper floors of urban buildings, while the ground floor has been given over to shops. Called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">multiplex</a>, the latest movie houses can be a cluster of smaller theaters and are located on the upper or uppermost floor of shopping malls. In the 1990s, there were about 200 cinema houses in Metro Manila of varying size, levels of comfort, and degrees of architectural value. But movie houses are facing big competition with the rise of new media and the availability of videos on demand through the Internet. Many moviemaking studios have shut down and been replaced by the television studio. The grand movie houses of the pre-World War II era, the 1950s to the 1970s, have disappeared. Instead, movie houses are now functional spaces that deliver entertainment using digital technology, thus the focus is on building an environment where movie watching is comfortable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Movie houses and theaters have also been built in entertainment complexes like Resorts World and Solaire. They are integrated into a complex with restaurants, shops, hotel, casino, and private residences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Future Prospects.</strong> The postmodern trend has freed architecture to explore new forms and come up with creative and eye-catching solutions to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/254\">architectural design</a>. Newer methods of construction, manifesting in stronger construction steel, better formulation of cement, environmentally responsible paints that avoid toxic substance, and alternative materials that will not deplete natural resources are impacting architecture. These materials are being imported as trade becomes more open in a global market. Materials for construction can be manufactured abroad in places like Japan and Korea for projects that require special material and equipment not available and not easy to manufacture in the Philippines. The containerization of shipping allows large modular parts to be shipped to the construction site and assembled there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The freedom to experiment and the possibilities of new material can free Philippine architecture from restrictive mindsets. The easy flow of global trends will come face to face with an enduring Filipinism and will continue to raise the question of what is Filipino in Philippine architecture. Moreover, the increasing population of the Philippines, urban migration, the rising cost of real estate caused in part by foreign investments, and the enduring presence of poor communities in urban areas will continue to challenge the ability of architects, developers, the government, and civil society to address the demand for building townscapes and architecture that are humane, protect the environment, and foster the quality of life. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

On the evening of 22 Feb, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Chief of Staff Gen Fidel Ramos declared that they were abandoning Pres Ferdinand Marcos and had called on the military loyal to the Republic to gather at the adjoining camps, Crame and Aguinaldo, along Epifanio de los Santos Ave (EDSA). At nine o&#x2019;clock in the evening, Jaime Cardinal Sin, through <a href=\"/8/8/4824\">Radio Veritas</a>, urged civilians to go to EDSA and station themselves between the camps. Although the call seemed unwise and foolish, by Sunday morning the crowd had increased to the hundred thousands and, by noon of 23 Feb, Enrile crossed EDSA to consolidate his loyal troops with those of Ramos. The Veritas transmitter went dead&#x2014;sabotaged, it was believed, by Marcos&#x2019;s troops. But from an unknown source, known only as <a href=\"/8/8/4822\">Radio Bandido</a>, broadcasts supportive of the events happening at EDSA were aired nationwide. Gatherings and protests like EDSA were repeated in major cities like Cebu and Davao."

There were more military defections to Ramos and Enrile and, by the evening of 26 Feb, the tide of popular support had turned.

Some projects turned out not to have been paid for or had extensive loans from local agencies. The Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) took over the <a href=\"/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, built with a loan from GSIS which had not been paid. Other projects, like Imelda&#x2019;s resort in Olot, Fort Ilocandia, and the Marcos house in Batac, fell under government investigation. University of Life went into a decline. The Santo Ni&#xF1;o Shrine in Tacloban was padlocked and remained unused until it was damaged by Typhoon Yolanda in Nov 2013. The <a href=\"/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> and the Makiling High School for the Arts continued to exist.

Republic Act (RA) 7227, BCDA, was signed on 13 Mar 1992, a few months before the next presidential election. Although RA 7227 was amended by RA 7917 in 1995 and by RA 9400 in 2007, the rationale for the act remained. BCDA was an instrument of government with corporate powers &#x201C;mandated to transform former US military bases into alternative productive civilian use&#x201D; (http://www.bcda.gov.ph/).

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "But the strongest effect of the Ramos presidency was opening the Philippine economy to more foreign investments under the aegis of greater regional cooperation. Under Ramos, BCDA moved forward. The Americans, who had left their bases at Subic Bay and Clark Field after they were devastated by the eruption of Mt Pinatubo on 15 Jun 1991, left behind large tracts of land leased from the Philippines but which had expired. The Philippines did not renew the lease."

The recreational Camp John Hay in <a href=\"/2/10/414\">Baguio</a> was returned to the Philippines with the exit of the American military. Under Ramos, these former American bases were opened for developers who would sign contracts for 25 years to develop the place following terms set by law. The amendments to the law allowed the redevelopment of other military bases. Aside from Subic, Clark, and John Hay, BCDA covers the Bataan Technology Park, Poro Point, Fort Bonifacio, and Villamor Airbase. Because it was located in the area of Metro Manila (NCR), straddling Makati City and Taguig City, Fort Bonifacio (formerly McKinley), is the most visible area of development.

High-rises of multiple use were the buildings of choice because of the rising value of real estate, especially of properties near or within the ambit of the metropolis. The government also launched a BOT (build-operate-transfer) scheme where an investor was allowed to develop public land and property for a set period like 25 years, enough time to recoup investment and make profit.

Seeing the success of this scheme, the next to be privatized was the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage System (MWSS), a government entity established before World War II. MWSS went into partnership with Manila Water and Maynilad in 1997 to upgrade and expand the distribution system of water in Metro Manila, Cavite, and Laguna."

An agency under the Department of Trade and Industry, PEZA was enacted under RA 7916, and signed into law by Ramos in 1995. PEZA is mandated to promote investment in export-oriented industry in the country and to assist investors. It facilitates the establishment of IT companies in business processing outsourcing (BPO) and in knowledge processing outsourcing.

This trend began in the 1980s, when churches, which were otherwise modern began building <a href=\"/2/5/240\"><strong>retablos</strong></a> in the baroque style. Such projects were spurred most likely by a reaction to post-Vatican II church designs which were straightforward and functional. A common complaint was these churches did not look Catholic; they looked Protestant. The root of this trend was modernism&#x2019;s adage &#x201C;form follows function.&#x201D; Post-Vatican II church design placed the celebration of Church rites at the center and the church building was subservient to these rites. In the modernist idiom, the church came alive when there was a celebration, otherwise it was an empty shell. But parishioners and devotees who had grown up with the opulence of baroque in old churches found the spaces dead and unappealing. Soon these rather empty churches were filled with statuary and other objects of devotion, placed in a baroque retablo inside a modernist church.

The reflective glass building, designed by American architect Philip Johnson, was completed in 1981 and seats 2,736 people. It was built for the Reformed Church in America founded by Dr. Robert H.

During certain seasons of the year, their wanderings bring them to the shore where they fish and make salt. During their sojourn, the Aeta build windscreens, called <strong>dait-dait</strong>, in clusters showing no predetermined pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A developed form of settlement already existed in prehispanic Philippines. The patterns of such settlements can be gleaned from the accounts of friar missionaries as well as from archaeology. Both demonstrate that communities living in riverine areas or along the littoral built their homes in a linear rather than compact pattern. The settlement of prehispanic Cebu is a good example. Although the Jesuit Pedro Chirino reports that the settlement of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu</a> stretched from what today would be downtown Cebu to Mandaue, the houses were not built in compact arrangements but rather strung along the seashore. However, there would be some massing of houses around the residence of an important personage like a datu (Hutteter 1973).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The village of Rajah Sulayman in Manila seems to have been of a different pattern. Essentially a trading center at the mouth of the Pasig, the main feature of the settlement was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fort</a> in which was found the residence of the rajah. Houses clustered around this fort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Settlements were generally dispersed. Casi&ntilde;o speculates that migrants from Java, Sumatra, and coastal Indochina were people fleeing from dynastic struggles and persecution. Coming upon a &ldquo;true tropical frontier,&rdquo; they saw &ldquo;no need or pressure to crowd in centers with central organization&rdquo; (Casi&ntilde;o 1977, 747). Hence, the dispersed pattern of settlements. Although dispersed, communities communicated with one another by utilizing seas, rivers, and other waterways. Inhabitants of the Philippines were expert seamen and shipwrights who built boats for travel, trade, and battle. Mountains and mountain ranges often proved to be insurmountable barriers; thus, no extensive road systems connected villages within the same island. Settlements on opposing shores of neighboring islands had better communications than those within the same island but separated by natural barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The linear and the clustering pattern of settlements persists today. Hart, documenting the Cebuano dwellings in Caticugan, Negros in 1959, remarks that, overall, settlement patterns are a result of the interaction of four factors: topography, land use, the apprehension of the supernatural, and inheritance rules. Hart remarks that the last two factors figure more strongly in the formation of settlements. He documents three patterns: houses lining the main path or the linear pattern; houses encircling the community school; and houses in clusters. What holds these units together are blood ties. Houses are built at some distance from each other to allow the free circulation of air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The linear pattern is also seen in southern Philippines. The settlement found in Barrio Luas, Parang, Sulu is typical. Houses are built along the main road, which follows the contour of the shore and one perpendicular to it. Some houses stand on stilts in the sea. A clustering of houses is found at the intersection of roads, near the wharf. Here the market, mosque, town hall, and Philippine Constabulary Camp are located. The clustering of houses near the wharf is dictated by trade. Here boats from other islands dock. Away from the road are clusters of houses (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2665\">Klassen</a> 1987).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> of the Cordilleras do not build large towns but rather have small villages with 7 to 87 dwellings, built in small groves near their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/241\">rice fields and terraces</a>. The sites chosen for habitation are those unfit for planting because they may be rocky. There are no streets in such settlements, and the houses are not arranged in straight rows even if the form of the terrace may dictate that they should be. Villages are not surrounded by fences, although the well-to-do may have fences of <strong>runo</strong> (cane grass), stone walls, cacti or sticks and branches as barriers. In 1906, Worcester reported, on the other hand, that the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> had houses placed together and often built in inaccessible spots. Surrounded by windbreaks of bamboo, these houses were raised several meters above the ground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lowland Filipinos, when building a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut), which is a new structure added to a settlement&mdash;observe a number of beliefs. Houses are built facing east for good luck. Doors are not made to face each other. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> of Panay, when building a house, take note of the position of the mythical Bakunawa. The months of January and February are best for house-building, while March is not. The beliefs concerning <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">house-building</a> among lowland Filipinos and the cultural communities demonstrate that nature is a living entity. Aside from respecting the natural contours of the land or the quality of the soil when building, the builder pacifies nature by rites or prayers. Ethnic patterns of settlement endure because they are deeply rooted in sensitivity to and respect for the environment. House-building and the establishment of settlements are seen as a way of being one with nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>The Hispanic Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast to the ethnic tradition that accepted the environment as something to be revered and to be in harmony with, the concept of rationally planned space was introduced by Spain. The Ordenanzas of 1573 or the &ldquo;Prescriptions for the Foundation of Hispanic Colonial Towns&rdquo; were a codification by Philip II of different instructions given to the conquistadors of the New World. A collection of building laws and zoning requirements that incorporated the experience of building in Latin America as well as the theories of architects from the time of imperial Rome to the Renaissance, the set of 28 ordinances contained practical directions on establishing settlements in the colonies. The heart of the plan was the <strong>plaza mayor</strong> (main square), a quadrilateral space bounded by streets. From here extended the streets in a grid pattern. Smaller plazas were located at a distance from the main plaza. After the street was laid out, a whole block was assigned for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> and the adjoining <strong>convento</strong> (parish house). In inland sites, the church was built on high ground and was approached by a flight of steps. In front of it was the plaza, so that it could be seen from a distance. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a> or town hall was built opposite the church.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">Schools</a> and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>tribunal</strong></a> or courthouse were later added near the town hall. In towns along the seacoast, the main plaza was near the landing of the port. The church was to be clearly visible from the port and was designed to serve as a defense for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contrast between the Spanish and the Portuguese town plan is striking. Whereas Spanish settlements were rationally planned, Portuguese settlements took advantage of a vista. Important buildings were built on elevated ground or promontories and then connected by streets. The gridiron plan with a plaza was an innovation in 16th-century Europe. The previous era preferred to mass together dwellings beside an important building, usually the church or cathedral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rationally and geometrically planned townscape was rooted in part in Philip II&rsquo;s own view that he was tasked by God to create a Utopia in the newly discovered world. Calling himself a new Solomon, the king sought to create an ideal townscape for God&rsquo;s glory. The Ordenanzas combined practical guidance and the aesthetics of urban planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spain introduced a hierarchy of settlements. At the apex was the <strong>ciudad</strong> (city), which in the Philippines was Manila; then came the other <strong>ciudades</strong>. Below them were the <strong>villa</strong> (chartered town) and the <strong>pueblo</strong> (municipality). The center of the pueblo was called <strong>cabecera</strong> (center) and later, <strong>poblaci&oacute;n</strong>. The poblaci&oacute;n had a church and convento, and eventually other buildings for civil administration. Below the poblaci&oacute;n were the barrios, ecclesiastically known as <strong>visitas</strong>, and below them the <strong>sitios</strong> or settlements consisting of a few houses. Newly organized settlements were called <strong>reduccion</strong> or <strong>rancheria</strong>, and ecclesiastically, <strong>doctrina</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transition from the linear settlement patterns or the clustering of indigenous settlements in the Philippines came about through the organization of the reducci&oacute;n; these were compact settlements, arranged in a grid pattern, around a church. The reducci&oacute;n was organized among newly Christianized tribes. In some cases, a settlement was already existing and needed only to be reorganized according to the Spanish tradition. Spanish chroniclers and bureaucrats invariably referred to the reorganization of a settlement as the founding of a pueblo. This should be understood as a legal statement, i.e., that the town was considered part of the colony&rsquo;s polity, rather than a statement to the effect that before the coming of the Spaniards there were no organized communities in the Philippines. The many indigenous place-names throughout the archipelago attest to the presence of organized communities before the coming of Spain. This is especially true in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, and Islamic areas. In other cases, dispersed settlements had to be banded as one. The missionary, more than the civil servant, was responsible for organizing many reducciones, which eventually became towns; hence the many saint names among Philippine towns. The missionaries were not always successful at coaxing people to live together. Sickness, fire, or natural calamity would cause them to disperse. Many reducciones were Sunday towns, i.e., the townspeople came to the settlement on Sunday for religious services and instruction and for trade. Then they would return back to their fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Native resistance to the reduccion was common. It manifested itself in three ways: the&nbsp;<em>remontados&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>cimarrones</em>, revolts, and foot dragging. The remontados were Christianized and hispanized Filipinos who took to the hills to escape tribute, forced labor, and injustice. In the Visayas they were called&nbsp;<em>mundos&nbsp;</em>(from Spanish &ldquo;vagamundos,&rdquo; vagabonds). Revolts were almost endemic in colonial Philippines, but these would not coalesce into a national revolution until 1896. Earlier revolts may have been spurred by a denunciation of Spanish civilizing efforts and the desire to return to the native way of life. One such uprising occurred in the Visayas in the 1620s. Called the Diwata Revolt, it began when the Visayans were enticed to leave their reducciones by the promise of a life abundant with food and free from taxation and forced labor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the mid-18th century, the urban centers of the Philippines, the Central Plains of Luzon, the Southern Tagalog region, the Bicol region, the coastal towns of the Visayas, parts of northern Mindanao, and the tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula were sufficiently hispanized. It took more than a century to reshape the form of colonial communities. Other places took longer to fall under Spanish influence. Batanes and the Cagayan Valley were not evangelized and hispanized until the late 18th century. Although the Spaniards had made inroads into the Cordilleras by the 18th century, their evangelization did not take place until the late 19th century. The island of Negros, named after the dark-skinned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Ati</a> tribe, was a missionary outpost from the 17th century, but its hispanization took place only with the sugar boom of the mid&ndash;19th century and the migration of many Ilonggo to the island. For centuries, Mindanao was barely under colonial control except for pockets around forts like Zamboanga, Ozamis, Cagayan de Oro, Tandag, and Caraga. By the 19th century, only in northern Mindanao could one find a strong Spanish presence. To speed up the colonization of Mindanao, the colonial government sent military forces to open settlements. Also sent were the undesirables of Manila: prisoners, prostitutes, vagabonds, and political enemies. They were exiled to Surigao and Davao to form the nucleus of new communities. Other places of exile were Paragua in Palawan, Dapitan, Guam, and the Marianas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hispanic town plan presupposed an urban economy, where trade more than agriculture was the means of livelihood and where the variety of occupations required various types of buildings. Urbanized space is specialized space, whereas in the ethnic tradition space was multipurpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best-known result of hispanic urbanization is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, which was actually two settlements, one military, and the other civil. Near the mouth of the river was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>, with its own plaza and military buildings. Manila&rsquo;s plaza mayor was the space fronting the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">cathedral</a>, presently called Plaza Roma. The main street, Calle Real, stretched from the old Puerta Real at the southern side of the city and passed by the old Jesuit college, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agust&iacute;n church</a> and monastery, passed the western flank of the cathedral, all the way to the empty space in front of the moat surrounding Fort Santiago. This space was called Plaza de Armas. Parallel and perpendicular to this main or royal road were the other streets of the city, the more important ones being Calle de Cabildo, Calle de Parian, Calle de Arzobispo, and a circumferential road that followed the contours of the city wall called Muralla. Outside Manila, most provincial capitals, major towns, and cities bear the hispanic mark. A notable example is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, Ilocos Sur. The core of the town revolves around the cathedral and the plaza in front of it, flanked by ecclesiastical and civil buildings. All streets are arranged parallel or perpendicular to the streets surrounding the plaza. Also among those retaining the hispanic plan are Naga and Tiwi in the Bicol region; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/424\">Pila</a>, Laguna; and the older core of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/417\">Cebu City</a>, near the cathedral and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/301\">Fort San Pedro</a>. In some cases, the hispanic town plan has been obscured by the urbanization plans of the Americans. In some instances, the plaza might be smaller than it originally was since the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/235\"><strong>munisipyo</strong></a> or town hall had appropriated land, which was once part of the plaza.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>The American Colonial Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1904 the American architect and city planner <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a> came to the Philippines upon the invitation of Gov-Gen William Cameron Forbes to prepare plans for Manila and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a>. A disciple of the &ldquo;City Beautiful&rdquo; movement, Burnham prepared plans for American cities like Cleveland, Chicago, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Washington DC. Ironically, Burnham&rsquo;s espousal of the movement and his predilection for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> idiom placed him in continuity with the hispanic tradition of urbanization, which was rooted in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classicism</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Burnham recommended that the street system of the old districts in Manila be maintained, but for the new section outside Intramuros proposed a radial pattern of streets with diagonal thoroughfares linking the city districts. As for Baguio, he proposed a development plan that took the terrain into consideration. In particular, he recommended building around a depressed area, now known as Burnham Park. Burnham stayed briefly in the Philippines and his plans were executed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2690\">William Parsons</a> and the Bureau of Public Works. Burnham&rsquo;s plans were modified by his successors and had not been fully implemented when World War II broke out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps more significant in the evolution of communities was the American colonial government&rsquo;s drive to improve education as a preparation for democracy and self-government, and communication and transportation as a means for improving the economy based on free enterprise, and public health. The lasting legacies of American rule in the townscape are the schools, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">public markets</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>, and city halls. Since ideally the schools were to be provided spacious campuses, they were often built away from the plaza mayor of the hispanic town plan. The school became a magnet that attracted the development of land around it for residential or business use. The city hall at times merely co-opted the casa real but more often than not, was a new building built on the same site or on a new site. Since the school stood for education and the city hall for democracy, these new structures became the centers of development. Improved communication meant the construction or improvement of roads, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/239\">lighthouses</a>, wharves, and piers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beginning in the 1930s, the Americans fostered migration to Mindanao to ease the congestion in Luzon and the Visayas. Touted as the promised land, Mindanao, especially Cotabato, which was then populated by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a>, became the destination of waves and waves of migrants who landed in the port of General Santos and, from thence, to their designated homesteads in the hinterlands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the American administration laid the foundations of modern urban life characterized by mobility, the quick exchange of goods and ideas, technology, and the amalgamation of populated areas into one urban center. American rule was perceived by some as benevolent and beneficent. However, nationalists were strong in criticizing the abuses of the regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"period\" name=\"period\"></a>The Period of the Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the years following World War II, the Philippines underwent major reconstruction. War had destroyed the means of livelihood all over the country and rural folk were compelled to migrate to the large cities in their search for employment. To meet the needs of a growing urban population, subdivisions began to appear. Earlier subdivisions like those in Singalong and Makati which catered to the middle class, and those in New Manila which accommodated the rich, were not complete communities but integrated themselves with the wider community. A highlight of the 1950s was the development of Philamlife Homes in Quezon City, which was envisioned as a total community by its planners with a community center, a church, a market, recreational facilities, and other amenities. The planners took advantage of the hilly site and created a road system that conformed to the terrain. The housing units designed by<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2635\">Carlos Arguelles</a> enjoyed efficient natural ventilation and had provisions for expansion. The total community concept is found in many subdivisions that mushroomed from the 1960s to the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The urban centers continue to attract migrants, but the burgeoning population of cities presents a problem. As population increases, increasing demands are made on the resources of the city, which can strain them to the point of decay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s, particularly during the term of Pres Ramon Magsaysay, migration was encouraged to help relieve the stress on the cities. Also in the 1950s, to meet the needs of low-income groups, the government built low-cost housing projects in Quezon City. The project units were simple, one-story structures with asbestos roofing and wooden jalousies for windows. During the Macapagal period or early 1960s, tenement houses rose in Barrio Punta, Santa Ana, Manila and Bicutan, Rizal. The failure of these tenement houses lay in the absence of necessary infrastructure. Many buildings had no running water and inadequate garbage disposal facilities. A legacy of the Marcos regime are the Bagong Lipunan Sites and Services or BLISS homes, also aimed at lower-income families. Built under the auspices of the Ministry of Human Settlements, they marked an advance over the older tenements as the homes were built to be part of total communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government efforts to provide housing and communities for the urban poor have been inadequate. In spite of the participation of the Church and big business in providing homes, first for their employees and then for the poor, urban housing falls way below what is needed. As a result, many <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\">shanties</a> have sprouted in the city. They first appeared after World War II as temporary shelters, but have become a permanent feature in the urban landscape. Large communities of the urban poor in Manila, popularly called &ldquo;squatters,&rdquo; are found in Tondo, Quezon City, along the Pasig River, along railroad tracks, and in the reclamation area of the Manila Bay foreshore. Other cities also have their communities of the urban poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1980s, a growing Philippine population (placed two decades and a half later at almost 99 million in 2014) and the increasing urbanization of the Philippines put pressure on housing. Catalyzed by the economic boom of the early 1990s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">high-rise condominiums</a>, some exceeding 20 stories, began to be built. With the government policy of privatization of non-productive and non-performing government assets, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) was created under Republic Act (RA) 7227, signed into law by Pres Corazon C. Aquino on 12 Mar 1992. The BCDA charter was amended by RA 7917 in 1995, and further amended by RA 94000 in 2007. The opening of Camp John Hay and Fort Bonifacio to redevelopment catalyzed the emergence of new urban spaces based on high-rise buildings. These building are often multiple use, that is, its upper floors or towers are residential and its lower floors or base, called a podium, is for stores, offices, parking and for common areas like gyms, sport centers, function rooms, and other amenities. Many of the podiums are designed with flat waterproof roofs so that a swimming pool, track fields, gardens, and outdoor parks can be built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This high-rise trend is found in many developments initiated no longer by government but by private developers. Instead of the sprawling subdivisions of the 1960s to the 1980s, the high-rise communities are more compact and minimize occupying the property with built structures. A balance between open spaces, landscape to improve the environment, and built space is planned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growing awareness about environment and the human impact on it has pushed for new initiatives in urban planning and construction. &ldquo;New urbanism&rdquo; is a term used to refer to an environmentally sensitive town plan and construction scheme that lowers human impact on the environment. Since the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to the degradation of air quality, towns are planned to minimize travel so all the basic resources and institutions of the community, like school, and market are close at hand. In construction, materials that are &ldquo;green,&rdquo; that is, have very little adverse environmental impact, are also used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subdivisions or gated communities of the previous decades are still being developed but these are often located in the suburbs. A variation of the gated community is the planned resorts and the communities of farms. The former are usually developed beside the sea and the communities of farms are residences in the countryside that have large lots, in which the residents can develop pocket farms. These suburban developments are often purchased to be used as vacation spots by their owners, but with the onset of age and retirement, the resort and farm communities are also attracting the elderly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of these communities are planned along a design theme that appeals to the imagination of the potential buyer seeking the good life. Popular is the Mediterranean style. In mountainous areas are found the Swiss style, characterized by a steep A-frame roof. The names of these new developments often suggest the prevailing and preferred style of the planned community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the new urban spaces address the needs of the middle class, often also the employed class&mdash;the communities of informal settlers&mdash;continue to challenge both the public and the private sector. Some well-known initiatives to address the housing needs of the low-income group are Habitat for Humanity, a foreign-based organization, and Gawad Kalinga, a local organization known for the colorful houses it builds. Both organizations rely on external donations to help finance the housing projects and the active participation of the residents of these houses. Gawad Kalinga goes beyond building or upgrading houses&mdash;it also helps communities to develop. It focuses on the empowerment of fathers and training community members in developing marketable skills and setting up their own businesses. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

The patterns of such settlements can be gleaned from the accounts of friar missionaries as well as from archaeology. Both demonstrate that communities living in riverine areas or along the littoral built their homes in a linear rather than compact pattern. The settlement of prehispanic Cebu is a good example. Although the Jesuit Pedro Chirino reports that the settlement of <a href=\"/2/10/417\">Cebu</a> stretched from what today would be downtown Cebu to Mandaue, the houses were not built in compact arrangements but rather strung along the seashore. However, there would be some massing of houses around the residence of an important personage like a datu (Hutteter 1973)."

Houses clustered around this fort."

				"value": "Settlements were generally dispersed. Casi&#xF1;o speculates that migrants from Java, Sumatra, and coastal Indochina were people fleeing from dynastic struggles and persecution. Coming upon a &#x201C;true tropical frontier,&#x201D; they saw &#x201C;no need or pressure to crowd in centers with central organization&#x201D; (Casi&#xF1;o 1977, 747). Hence, the dispersed pattern of settlements. Although dispersed, communities communicated with one another by utilizing seas, rivers, and other waterways. Inhabitants of the Philippines were expert seamen and shipwrights who built boats for travel, trade, and battle. Mountains and mountain ranges often proved to be insurmountable barriers; thus, no extensive road systems connected villages within the same island. Settlements on opposing shores of neighboring islands had better communications than those within the same island but separated by natural barriers."

Hart, documenting the Cebuano dwellings in Caticugan, Negros in 1959, remarks that, overall, settlement patterns are a result of the interaction of four factors: topography, land use, the apprehension of the supernatural, and inheritance rules. Hart remarks that the last two factors figure more strongly in the formation of settlements. He documents three patterns: houses lining the main path or the linear pattern; houses encircling the community school; and houses in clusters. What holds these units together are blood ties. Houses are built at some distance from each other to allow the free circulation of air."

Houses are built along the main road, which follows the contour of the shore and one perpendicular to it. Some houses stand on stilts in the sea. A clustering of houses is found at the intersection of roads, near the wharf. Here the market, mosque, town hall, and Philippine Constabulary Camp are located. The clustering of houses near the wharf is dictated by trade. Here boats from other islands dock. Away from the road are clusters of houses (<a href=\"/2/2/2665\">Klassen</a> 1987)."

The sites chosen for habitation are those unfit for planting because they may be rocky. There are no streets in such settlements, and the houses are not arranged in straight rows even if the form of the terrace may dictate that they should be. Villages are not surrounded by fences, although the well-to-do may have fences of <strong>runo</strong> (cane grass), stone walls, cacti or sticks and branches as barriers. In 1906, Worcester reported, on the other hand, that the <a href=\"/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> had houses placed together and often built in inaccessible spots. Surrounded by windbreaks of bamboo, these houses were raised several meters above the ground."

The <a href=\"/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> of Panay, when building a house, take note of the position of the mythical Bakunawa. The months of January and February are best for house-building, while March is not. The beliefs concerning <a href=\"/2/6/253\">house-building</a> among lowland Filipinos and the cultural communities demonstrate that nature is a living entity. Aside from respecting the natural contours of the land or the quality of the soil when building, the builder pacifies nature by rites or prayers. Ethnic patterns of settlement endure because they are deeply rooted in sensitivity to and respect for the environment. House-building and the establishment of settlements are seen as a way of being one with nature."

A collection of building laws and zoning requirements that incorporated the experience of building in Latin America as well as the theories of architects from the time of imperial Rome to the Renaissance, the set of 28 ordinances contained practical directions on establishing settlements in the colonies. The heart of the plan was the <strong>plaza mayor</strong> (main square), a quadrilateral space bounded by streets. From here extended the streets in a grid pattern. Smaller plazas were located at a distance from the main plaza. After the street was laid out, a whole block was assigned for the <a href=\"/2/5/244\">church</a> and the adjoining <strong>convento</strong> (parish house).

The center of the pueblo was called <strong>cabecera</strong> (center) and later, <strong>poblaci&#xF3;n</strong>. The poblaci&#xF3;n had a church and convento, and eventually other buildings for civil administration. Below the poblaci&#xF3;n were the barrios, ecclesiastically known as <strong>visitas</strong>, and below them the <strong>sitios</strong> or settlements consisting of a few houses.

The reducci&#xF3;n was organized among newly Christianized tribes. In some cases, a settlement was already existing and needed only to be reorganized according to the Spanish tradition. Spanish chroniclers and bureaucrats invariably referred to the reorganization of a settlement as the founding of a pueblo. This should be understood as a legal statement, i.e., that the town was considered part of the colony&#x2019;s polity, rather than a statement to the effect that before the coming of the Spaniards there were no organized communities in the Philippines. The many indigenous place-names throughout the archipelago attest to the presence of organized communities before the coming of Spain. This is especially true in the <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, and Islamic areas. In other cases, dispersed settlements had to be banded as one. The missionary, more than the civil servant, was responsible for organizing many reducciones, which eventually became towns; hence the many saint names among Philippine towns. The missionaries were not always successful at coaxing people to live together. Sickness, fire, or natural calamity would cause them to disperse. Many reducciones were Sunday towns, i.e., the townspeople came to the settlement on Sunday for religious services and instruction and for trade. Then they would return back to their fields."

The remontados were Christianized and hispanized Filipinos who took to the hills to escape tribute, forced labor, and injustice. In the Visayas they were called&#xA0;<em>mundos&#xA0;</em>(from Spanish &#x201C;vagamundos,&#x201D; vagabonds). Revolts were almost endemic in colonial Philippines, but these would not coalesce into a national revolution until 1896. Earlier revolts may have been spurred by a denunciation of Spanish civilizing efforts and the desire to return to the native way of life. One such uprising occurred in the Visayas in the 1620s. Called the Diwata Revolt, it began when the Visayans were enticed to leave their reducciones by the promise of a life abundant with food and free from taxation and forced labor."

It took more than a century to reshape the form of colonial communities. Other places took longer to fall under Spanish influence. Batanes and the Cagayan Valley were not evangelized and hispanized until the late 18th century. Although the Spaniards had made inroads into the Cordilleras by the 18th century, their evangelization did not take place until the late 19th century. The island of Negros, named after the dark-skinned <a href=\"/1/2/2327\">Ati</a> tribe, was a missionary outpost from the 17th century, but its hispanization took place only with the sugar boom of the mid&#x2013;19th century and the migration of many Ilonggo to the island. For centuries, Mindanao was barely under colonial control except for pockets around forts like Zamboanga, Ozamis, Cagayan de Oro, Tandag, and Caraga. By the 19th century, only in northern Mindanao could one find a strong Spanish presence. To speed up the colonization of Mindanao, the colonial government sent military forces to open settlements. Also sent were the undesirables of Manila: prisoners, prostitutes, vagabonds, and political enemies. They were exiled to Surigao and Davao to form the nucleus of new communities. Other places of exile were Paragua in Palawan, Dapitan, Guam, and the Marianas."

				"value": "The best-known result of hispanic urbanization is <a href=\"/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, which was actually two settlements, one military, and the other civil. Near the mouth of the river was <a href=\"/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>, with its own plaza and military buildings. Manila&#x2019;s plaza mayor was the space fronting the <a href=\"/2/8/334\">cathedral</a>, presently called Plaza Roma. The main street, Calle Real, stretched from the old Puerta Real at the southern side of the city and passed by the old Jesuit college, <a href=\"/2/8/369\">San Agust&#xED;n church</a> and monastery, passed the western flank of the cathedral, all the way to the empty space in front of the moat surrounding Fort Santiago. This space was called Plaza de Armas. Parallel and perpendicular to this main or royal road were the other streets of the city, the more important ones being Calle de Cabildo, Calle de Parian, Calle de Arzobispo, and a circumferential road that followed the contours of the city wall called Muralla. Outside Manila, most provincial capitals, major towns, and cities bear the hispanic mark. A notable example is <a href=\"/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, Ilocos Sur. The core of the town revolves around the cathedral and the plaza in front of it, flanked by ecclesiastical and civil buildings. All streets are arranged parallel or perpendicular to the streets surrounding the plaza. Also among those retaining the hispanic plan are Naga and Tiwi in the Bicol region; <a href=\"/2/10/424\">Pila</a>, Laguna; and the older core of <a href=\"/2/10/417\">Cebu City</a>, near the cathedral and <a href=\"/2/8/301\">Fort San Pedro</a>. In some cases, the hispanic town plan has been obscured by the urbanization plans of the Americans. In some instances, the plaza might be smaller than it originally was since the <a href=\"/2/5/235\"><strong>munisipyo</strong></a> or town hall had appropriated land, which was once part of the plaza."

Since ideally the schools were to be provided spacious campuses, they were often built away from the plaza mayor of the hispanic town plan. The school became a magnet that attracted the development of land around it for residential or business use. The city hall at times merely co-opted the casa real but more often than not, was a new building built on the same site or on a new site. Since the school stood for education and the city hall for democracy, these new structures became the centers of development.

Earlier subdivisions like those in Singalong and Makati which catered to the middle class, and those in New Manila which accommodated the rich, were not complete communities but integrated themselves with the wider community. A highlight of the 1950s was the development of Philamlife Homes in Quezon City, which was envisioned as a total community by its planners with a community center, a church, a market, recreational facilities, and other amenities. The planners took advantage of the hilly site and created a road system that conformed to the terrain. The housing units designed by<strong> </strong><a href=\"/2/11/2635\">Carlos Arguelles</a> enjoyed efficient natural ventilation and had provisions for expansion.

The project units were simple, one-story structures with asbestos roofing and wooden jalousies for windows. During the Macapagal period or early 1960s, tenement houses rose in Barrio Punta, Santa Ana, Manila and Bicutan, Rizal. The failure of these tenement houses lay in the absence of necessary infrastructure. Many buildings had no running water and inadequate garbage disposal facilities. A legacy of the Marcos regime are the Bagong Lipunan Sites and Services or BLISS homes, also aimed at lower-income families.

With the government policy of privatization of non-productive and non-performing government assets, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) was created under Republic Act (RA) 7227, signed into law by Pres Corazon C. Aquino on 12 Mar 1992. The BCDA charter was amended by RA 7917 in 1995, and further amended by RA 94000 in 2007. The opening of Camp John Hay and Fort Bonifacio to redevelopment catalyzed the emergence of new urban spaces based on high-rise buildings. These building are often multiple use, that is, its upper floors or towers are residential and its lower floors or base, called a podium, is for stores, offices, parking and for common areas like gyms, sport centers, function rooms, and other amenities.

Interior design was institutionalized as a profession in 1963, when the Philippine Institute of Interior Design (PIID) was founded. The Philippine School of Interior Design (PSID) was established to train professionals in 1965. Today, several colleges and universities offer formal courses, and professionals may apply for a license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the ages the form, function, design, and decoration of the interiors of Philippine habitations have been determined by the environment and culture. Nomadic man sheltered in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/233\">caves</a>, in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/248\">trees</a>, and in makeshift <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\">windscreens</a> while hunting and gathering. The development of agriculture encouraged population clustering and house architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inter-island, and later, international trade, brought about larger concentrations of population. The homogeneity of architecture and art by region roughly corresponds to present ethnolinguistic boundaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shift from nomadic to sedentary to urban life is seen in the number of household artifacts found in increasing amounts in archaeological sites from the Stone to the Metal to the &ldquo;Porcelain&rdquo; Ages. Stone and metal tools and artifacts, as well as actual structures, attest to the degree of ancient Filipino woodworking skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Archaeologists have found traces of the <strong>haligi</strong> (massive wooden posts) of protohistoric houses in many places.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>The Indigenous Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>European chroniclers provide a glimpse into 16th-century Philippine houses. In 1521 Pigafetta described the house of Cebu&rsquo;s chief as being &ldquo;built like a hayloft&rdquo; (Blair and Robertson XXXIII, 121). He added: &ldquo;Their houses are constructed of wood, and are built of planks and bamboo, raised high from the ground on large logs, and one must enter them by means of ladders. They have rooms like ours; and under the house they keep their swine, goats and fowls&rdquo; (Blair and Robertson XXXIII, 153).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His impression was that there was little or no <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> houses. The visitors sat on bamboo mats &ldquo;with feet drawn up like tailors&rdquo; (Blair and Robertson XXXIII, 121). The people slept on reed or palm leaf mats, with pillows made of leaves. However, Pigafetta noted imported <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">porcelain ware</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">storage jars</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">bronze gongs</a> inside the houses. He was told by Awi, Butuan&rsquo;s chief, that &ldquo;all of his dishes&rdquo; and &ldquo;also some portion&rdquo; of his house were made of gold (Blair and Robertson XXXIII, 121-23).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Spaniards reached Manila some 50 years later, they saw a large, prosperous, and fortified town. The house of Manila&rsquo;s ruler Rajah Sulayman, before it was burnt to the ground, &ldquo;was very large, and it contained many valuable things such as money, copper, iron, porcelain, blankets, wax, cotton, and wooden vats full of brandy&rdquo; (Blair and Robertson XXXIII, 103).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the turn of the 17th century, Chirino observed that in the more typical Luzon house, natives ate seated on the floor, their tables being &ldquo;small, low and round or square in shape,&rdquo; and after eating, &ldquo;they removed the tables and cleared the house&rdquo; (Blair and Robertson XII, 308). The anonymous author of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2152\">Boxer Codex</a>, writing at around the same time, confirmed the lack of substantial furniture: &ldquo;They are not accustomed to sleep in beds nor do they have them, although they find them comfortable, because they could make them from a certain thing taken from trees which they call in their tongue&nbsp;<em>baro</em>, which serves as mattress like wood. They sleep on the floor of their houses, in the elevated portion which they inhabit, as the portion below is not used. They place beneath their bodies only some palm mats. Others sleep on some hammocks made by cotton cloth, which they hang with two pieces of rope from the poles of bamboos of the house&rdquo; (Quirino and Garcia 1958, 413).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine architecture has been compared with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2096\">basket weaving</a>. The similarity rests not only on the structural technique but, more importantly, in the spatial concept of the traditional house. The basic structural volume is that of a cubic room raised on posts, topped by a pyramidal, hipped, or gabled roof. All of the space under the roof is regarded in terms of vertical containment, or &ldquo;space upon space.&rdquo; The interior of the archetypal Philippine house does not have walls. The partitioning of areas, based on the concept of &ldquo;spaces within a space,&rdquo; is a feature of more advanced interior design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional house has no ceiling, with the under layer of the roof left exposed. The upper interior space may be used to store firewood, grain, valuables, and even dead ancestors. Between the roofing tie-beam and the floor are shelves and platforms that define levels of space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many regions the space below floor girders and between the house posts is enclosed, thus utilizing the ground level for storage, sheltering livestock, or working on crafts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The walls of the house are also often extended outside the basic structural frame to the limit of the roof eaves, creating &ldquo;space surrounded by space.&rdquo; The peripheral extensions are raised slightly from the floor level, functioning as sleeping platforms, seats, and shelves. When built with slatted flooring material, they also help to ventilate the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>dapugan</strong> and <strong>batalan</strong> (stove and washing areas) may have originally been, in the same manner, extended shelves. The next logical step was to extend the dapugan and the batalan into a protruding annex with a slightly lower flooring, wall, and <strong>sibi</strong> (awning). The latter term also refers to the extension creating a front porch. It is roofed over, like the batalan, but without walls, only railings. On one side, the access ladder cuts into the guard rail. With such annexes, the central space is maximized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional one-family house shelters an adult couple and several children below the age of puberty. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut) structure is typical in the highland communal villages in northern Luzon where, upon adolescence, children move to gender-specific dormitories, as well as in lowland cultures where children are encouraged to marry at an early age and set up their own households.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In communal cultures where larger houses shelter extended families, the same interior space planning concepts are also applied. There is still one open multifunctional common hall. Individual and nuclear family areas are defined only by mats, low storage chests or woven boxes, and fiber screens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In such longhouses the head of the household and his mate sleep behind a partition, while the rest sleep in the common hall. In more developed communities, the partitioned area is a room, i.e., it has permanent walls and a door. The room, aside from being the master&rsquo;s sleeping area, also stores valuables and serves as a dressing room. It is called the <strong>silid</strong>, which in Tagalog means &ldquo;to keep safe,&rdquo; referring perhaps to the original function of the space as the place for storing valuables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Islamized communities, the women stay behind a partition in the common hall. The segregation of women was carried to the extreme in the late-period <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\"><strong>torogan</strong></a> (datu&rsquo;s large house). Behind the <strong>panggao</strong> (sleeping area) of the datu was the <strong>gibon</strong>, a room specially built for the princess and her ladies,&nbsp;<em>manga raga</em>. Here they were trained in the arts of gentility and kept away from the prying eyes of commoners. Even more exclusive households had a one-room tower extending from the center of the roof. The airy room, accessed only from behind the headboard of the datu&rsquo;s bed, was called the <strong>lamin</strong>, and its occupant, the&nbsp;<em>liyamin</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Essentially, the concept of the house as &ldquo;spaces within a space&rdquo; or an enclosure assigned to particular members of the household and with specific functions, came only in later stages of cultural development. This can be gleaned from the appropriation of Hispanic terms: <strong>cuarto</strong> (room); <strong>dormitorio</strong> (bedroom); <strong>canon principal</strong> (main hall); <strong>sala</strong> (drawing room); <strong>galeria</strong> (hall); <strong>antesala</strong> (reception room); <strong>cocina</strong> (kitchen), and <strong>sala comedor</strong> (dining room).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the northern Luzon highland house, interior ornamentation is minimal. As the climate makes windows inadvisable, everything inside the house is blackened by soot from the open hearth. <strong>Pamadingan</strong> (walls) are of hardwood planks, sometimes with chiseled patterns. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, structural embellishment consists of carving anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figures on the <strong>hogohog</strong>, the shelf mounts over the hearth, and on the <strong>halda</strong> or <strong>patie</strong>, an open shelf for displaying luxury items like imported jars; the underside of the shelf has hooks in the form of animals, from which baskets and utensils are hung. The roof&rsquo;s main vertical support, the <strong>kinabigat</strong> (kingpost), is the major interior architectural detail. Among the wealthiest lfugao, it is carved in the form of an upright human figure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kept inside the house is the anito or house guardian, and sometimes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><em>bulol</em></a>, the pair of harvest ritual figures. At the ground level of the house may be displayed the&nbsp;<em>hagabi</em>, a long bench carved out of a massive tree trunk. It is shaped like a high bench forming an apex at the center and terminating on both ends in huge, stylized animal heads with large round ears. The bulol, the hagabi, and the kinabigat are ascending status indicators, granted to a family by the village only after a prescribed series of ceremonial feast giving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some lfugao districts, the <strong>po-kok</strong> (grain storage) is so large it is almost part of the architecture. It consists of floating large planks pegged and grooved to vertical supports, with a removable door sometimes carved with a human figure. The lfugao also use the <strong>dulong</strong> (sleeping platform), a massive plank of wood carved so that a narrow siding and a wide headrest are left raised and the foot open. They also use <strong>dalapong</strong> (low stools), sometimes with its base and its stem-handles carved to suggest abstract animal feet, heads, and tails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a> in northern Luzon, status is indicated by the number and quality of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2119\">ceremonial weaves</a> hung about the house upon the death of a family member and during other rites of passage. The textiles are taken down and put back in storage after the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2119\">Textiles</a> also play an important part in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> interior decoration. The ordinary Maranao <strong>walay</strong> (house) is functionally and spatially indistinguishable from that of the northern Luzon <strong>bale</strong>, Tagalog <strong>bahay</strong>, and Visayan <strong>balay</strong>. Likewise, there is minimal architectural detail in the Maranao interior, although royal houses are highly ornamented in the exterior, with <strong>panolong</strong> (protruding <em>okir</em>-carved facade elements), and wall and window panels. However, the Maranao sleeping area is surrounded by&nbsp;<em>mamadiyang&nbsp;</em>(curtains) and topped by a <strong>kolambo</strong> (canopy) to catch insects falling from the roof. These textile hangings are more elaborate in the torogan. The canopy, also called <strong>riniped</strong>, would be of silk and satin, and embellished with&nbsp;<em>libot&nbsp;</em>(applique work), embroidery, spangles, and headwork. The central panel, visible to the datu lying down on the bed, would depict the&nbsp;<em>Ka&rsquo;aba&nbsp;</em>in Mecca or the&nbsp;<em>borak</em>, the mythical winged horse with a woman&rsquo;s head which brought the Prophet to heaven, or a floral pattern. During a&nbsp;<em>kalilang&nbsp;</em>(festive gathering), the walls are covered with <strong>lalansay</strong> or continuous hangings which may surround the interior of the torogan from the beams to the floor. Hangings may also decorate the facade of the torogan. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2107\">Decorative vessels</a> and utensils displayed during such occasions include the <strong>gador</strong>, silver-inlaid brass urns; the <strong>lotoan</strong> and the <strong>salapa</strong>, silver-inlaid brass and heavily gilt betel-nut boxes, respectively; the <strong>bintang</strong>, a heavily gilt presentation tray; and other prestige objects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>The Hispanic Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hispanic acculturation altered Filipino interiors. The houses of the more affluent began to reflect the social, economic, and cultural changes brought about by colonization. The houses of the poorest peasants changed the least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spaniards, first of all, transformed habitation patterns. Indigenous settlements had been linear, in strategic locations along bodies of water. Church-and-State rule imposed concentration of the populace <strong>bajo las campanas</strong> or within hearing distance of the church bells. Towns were planned in a grid pattern, with a central plaza dominated by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\"><strong>iglesia</strong></a> (church) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/223\"><strong>casa real</strong></a> (town hall).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>bahay pari</strong> (priest&rsquo;s house) or <strong>convento</strong>, beside the church, served as the model for the hispanized Filipino house. Initially, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">materials</a> and basic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">construction methods</a> remained indigenous, although the friars must have required more interior partitioning than was traditional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Manila and major missionary centers, where conventos housed more than a handful of clerics, the planning would have departed radically from the indigenous pattern. There would have been more <strong>celdas</strong> or <strong>aposentos</strong> (individual rooms), a larger <strong>refectorio</strong> (common hall), a more commodious <strong>cocina</strong> (kitchen), <strong>servicios</strong> (privies), and a reception area for parishioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Disastrous fires and typhoons soon convinced the Spaniards that traditional Filipino building materials were impractical for their purposes. From the late 16th century they began constructing <strong>casas de canteria y teja</strong>, houses of wood and stone with tile roofs, in the colonial style of the period. When earthquakes during the first half of the 17th century leveled many such structures, local builders began to adapt Spanish colonial design to local conditions using native construction methods: the roof was supported by haligi, and masonry was utilized as curtain walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As towns consolidated through the 17th century, the bahay pari, of permanent materials like those in the major mission centers, were constructed by Filipino, Chinese, and Japanese <strong>maestros de obras</strong> (master builders) in the countryside. Perhaps masonry was so costly that certain walls of stone were utilized only around the ground story, or wood was considered a material more suited to the climate, or there was need to reduce the weight borne by the load-bearing ground floor stone walls. Perhaps for all the above reasons local builders invented the half-stone, half-wood <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house). The preferred types of structural timber were&nbsp;<em>mulawin&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>tugas&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>yakal&nbsp;</em>for their strength and resistance to rot. Interior members were made of narra and ipil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in traditional houses, the upper level was where members of the household lived. The <strong>zaguan</strong> (ground floor), was used for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">storage of rice</a> and other agricultural products as well as&nbsp;<em>carrozas&nbsp;</em>(processional floats), or as an informal receiving area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once structures were built of solid materials, interiors became dark and ill ventilated. Windows, which were traditionally grass or bamboo screens hinged at the top and extendable like awnings, became cumbersome when fashioned of solid wood panels. This was solved by making sliding panels, the sills of which also served as additional structural supports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some 17th century-style houses the Chinese Ming period building plan was adopted, with the house constructed in a rectangle around an airwell or open courtyard with a garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conventional convento plan consisted of a rectangular main block with celdas, refectorio, and <strong>galerias</strong> (galleries), with an annex for the cocina and service areas. In the modest bahay pari and its offspring, the bahay na bato, the house proper was smaller, with only a few rooms and a drawing room used only for ceremonial occasions. Meals were taken in the enlarged cocina; often this became a formal sala comedor, while still another annex would later be added to function as the new kitchen. An extension of the cocina was the <strong>azotea</strong>, an unroofed area where the cistern or large water storage jars were located. The azotea was where messy household work was done, including laundry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus domestic buildings gradually evolved into an &ldquo;L&rdquo; plan, with the dining, kitchen, and services areas forming the short side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the development of art during the Spanish colonial era can be divided into two: the Mission period, from 1565 to 1762; and the Hacienda period, from 1762 to 1898.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first period was characterized by the growth of the missions and towns in the countryside, on the one hand, and the development of Manila as a metropolis and as an international entrepot, on the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manila was the center of the colonial bureaucracy, both civil and ecclesiastical, and the mercantile sector which engaged in Asian and trans-Pacific trade. In the countryside, the colonial presence consisted principally of the friars, since civilian authorities were, initially, encomendero families who administered populations for only two generations. Appointees later occupied their positions for only short periods. Consequently, most permanent structures were built by missionaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emphasis on the ceiling was an important innovation of colonial design. In traditional houses, fiber netting and textile weaves were used as functional and decorative canopies. In lowland architecture, <strong>sawali</strong> (woven-bamboo strip) matting functioned as <strong>kisami</strong> (ceiling). Overhead decorations were given importance during the Mission period; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque-style</a> coffered or tray ceiling camouflaged the heavy trusses of clay-tile roofs. The strapwork painting on the barrel vault ceiling of a chamber in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Convent</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a> is an early example of ceiling ornamentation. Some 18th-century examples are still extant in some houses south of Cebu City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in Western houses of the period, the stairway leading into the upper level was incorporated into the house, and the main door was moved to the ground level. The door became massive, swing-in gates in the process, with masonry portal formed into an arch. The stair banister was supported by flat slats with a carved outline and later, by turned balusters. Newel posters were sometimes carved with local floral patterns which included stylized&nbsp;<em>katmon</em>. An outstanding motif of the period was the <strong>pi&ntilde;a</strong> or pineapple, adapted from the&nbsp;<em>pigna&nbsp;</em>or acorn motif of European classical decoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another architectural feature that lent itself to ornamentation was the corbel. In the early bahay na bato, the corbels were at least partially exposed since the ceiling commenced at the joists. They were carved, sometimes into the form of chimera and anthropomorphic figures, sometimes in a floral pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While houses in Manila may have been richly furnished with European and Oriental <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\"><strong>muebles</strong></a> (furniture), as wills and inventories testify, houses outside of Manila may have been sparsely furnished. Most houses would have had a bed, a cabinet, several chests, a chair or two, an altar table, a candlestand, a dining table, long benches, a food cabinet, and little else. Preferred woods were molave, tindalo, and&nbsp;<em>kamagong</em>, until deforestation made the use of narra and ipil more practical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reports of the 17th-century Manila state that even Europeans slept on mats on the floor, since it was more comfortable. The low cabinets and chests would have been in the bedrooms. The altar table would have been in the master&rsquo;s bedroom; over it would be a small <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">religious painting</a> on wood, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">santos</a>, and candlesticks. To store valuables, the altar table would have some drawers with locks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the common hall long benches would be lined along the wall, and near the windows would be one or two chairs for the master of the house or important visitors. The dining table in the comedor would be flanked by long benches with the food safe and plate storage cabinet nearby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 18th century the Iberian domination of the world was in decline. The Dutch and the English preyed on Spanish ships, and they established lucrative plantations in their own colonies. By no means was Spain crippled; its silver was still the recognized currency world over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines the galleon trade remained Manila&rsquo;s major source of income. The friar corporations controlled a large part of the trade, and with their estates and royal patronage they maintained their position as the economic elite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chinese sector or the comprador or trader class began to ally themselves often by marriage with the native&nbsp;<em>principalia&nbsp;</em>or aristocracy, many of whom had earlier intermarried with Europeans and who controlled land and had influence over the populace. The result was the Filipino&nbsp;<em>mestizaje&nbsp;</em>or half-breeds, who were heirs to three cultural legacies: the native, the Oriental, and the Occidental. This was reflected in the architecture of their houses, their interiors, and furnishings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Philippines was integrated into the world economy, other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Western influences</a> began to affect local culture and society. During the Mission period these influences were mainly Flemish and Italian (what we call &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo;). The subsequent Hacienda period was influenced by French and later by English trends. This was reflected in the succession of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">rococo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> styles through the 18th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Particularly from the latter part of the century, landed estates began to be consolidated and transformed into haciendas that raised cash and export crops. The Spaniards lost political prestige and, for a while, the economy went into a tailspin with the British occupation of Manila, 1762-1764; the peninsula itself was undergoing changes with the ascension of the Bourbons in Madrid, and later, the rise of liberalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The wealth of the colony was increasingly generated by the mestizo elite, who sought to express their new status. These changes were reflected in domestic construction and innovations in architecture and interior design. Instead of the squat, low, and sparely furnished houses of the Mission period, large, spacious, and better-furnished homes were built during the Hacienda period. There was an increased emphasis on the sense of spaciousness, ventilation, and light. Houses had to be open and congenial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cross-ventilation for the rooms was achieved with the use of an architectural element similar to the Japanese <strong>rama</strong>, i.e., pierced panels over doors and the upper portion of partitions. It may have been at this time that windows with shell panels, also found in mariner towns in England and China, came into popular use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Awareness of design and style grew, particularly in the late 18th century. Functionality became only one consideration; embellishment grew in importance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One indication of the design trend at that time is the table found in the Taal area, identified as the work of a &ldquo;Batangas Master&rdquo; <strong>ebanista</strong>. Made of tindalo, it retained the basic form of Ming-style altar tables: a chest of three drawers raised on cabriole legs on a skeletal stand with short ogee feet. But the flanges and apron have curved outlines and trellised piecework. The tabletop is edged with angular-section and dentil moldings, and the drawer frames are step carved on the front.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exuberant &ldquo;confusion&rdquo; of design traditions, also a feature of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">Morong church</a> facade, has been dubbed the <strong>estilo de compuesto</strong> or composite style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1815 the galleon trade ceased, depriving the religious orders of a major source of income. As the church could spend less and less on art, the principalia slowly advanced as art patrons, eventually superseding the clergy by their sheer number. Unlike the religious, this new elite imbibed the liberal ideas of the Enlightenment, which they worked in architectural or art form, into their houses. With this new elite, there is a heightened sense of individuality and self- importance, of style and grandeur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 19th-century bahay na bato balanced the considerations of privacy and public function. Generally, houses became bigger. More bedrooms were built. Entertainment areas had to accommodate not only the resident extended family but whole clans gathered for ceremonials. The important houses had a <strong>salon de baile</strong> (ballroom), as in the Lizares house in Talisay, Negros Occidental.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two developments shaped the look of Filipino interiors in the 19th century. First, there was a succession of stylistic revivals throughout that era ranging from neoclassicism, the second baroque movement, the Gothic revival, orientalist, and other trends. Second, the increase in international trade resulted in the flood of foreign manufactured household items. Ships that came to load sugar, rice, indigo, wood, and other native products unloaded Anglo-Indian and Anglo-Chinese furniture, Bristol glass, Austrian crystal, French porcelain, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interiors first composed during the late 18th century may have begun as neoclassical, spare, and symmetrical spaces. Houses stored and displayed riches, with the characteristic Isabelina or mid-Victorian look. Houses were also expanded or renovated by succeeding owners in a later revivalist style resulting in eclectic interiors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Henson house in Angeles City is one example. The original, early 19th-century part of the house, now the master&rsquo;s bedroom, retains the bahay kubo form, with a steep pyramidal ceiling. The sala comedor has a coffered ceiling, bordered by tin sheet panels stamped with a baroque revival design. Off to one side are bedrooms which were added even much later. The discontinuous interior style is typical, reflecting the changing styles and fortunes of successive generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attempt to rationalize space and to create a tighter unity between interiors and furniture began in the late 19th century. There were several factors. First, illustrated periodicals from Europe began to reach the Philippines regularly, particularly after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Knowledge of trends and the availability of imported materials made possible the recreation of European interiors. Second, a succession of destructive earthquakes moved the government to require the approval of drawn plans for new construction. Prior conceptualization forced house owners to coordinate interior elements. Third, professional architects like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas</a> began to make their mark.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These developments, together with other factors, gave rise to the production of furniture in multiples, an indication of the prevalence of fashionable trends in interior design. Perhaps the most successful furniture atelier during the late 19th century and the early 20th century was that of Ah Tay, a Chinese artisan in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>. Extant examples of his furniture are in the second baroque style, with Gothic revival elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facsimiles of imported furniture also became fashionable. The bentwood birch chairs designed by Austrian Auguste Thonet, the first knockdown furniture to hit the international market, were imported to the Philippines and became a staple of dining rooms and the growing restaurant market. It was copied in the Philippines using tropical hardwood, which was carved rather than steam bent. An inexpensive, hence popular, version in rattan and rattan <strong>solihiya</strong> or caning was known as <strong>batibot</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interiors of colonial churches, aside from a very few <strong>casas reales</strong> (municipal government houses) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/249\"><strong>tribunales</strong></a> (court houses), are surviving examples of interior design in public buildings during the Spanish regime. The interior space of the church&mdash;nave, transept, sanctuary, and dome&mdash;was the object of architectural planning. However, the ornamentation of the interior could be regarded as interior design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The portion of the interior given the most attention was the sanctuary, with its <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><strong>retablo</strong></a> or altarpiece, and main altar, and such particular features as the communion rail, the tabernacle, and the sanctuary. Features outside the sanctuary that were diligently designed and executed were the side altars, the pulpit, the choir loft, and the baptistry. If the church had a dome, the ceiling of the dome would be decorated with paintings. In the absence of a true dome, a dome-shaped ceiling is hung from a pyramidal roof. Portraits of the four evangelists were traditionally painted on the pendentives, the triangular wall sections that link the dome to its vertical supports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the roof was not a stone vault but of wooden frames, a ceiling of <strong>tabique</strong> or metal sheets was curved to give the appearance of a vault. The ceiling of the nave was sometimes decorated with paintings of biblical vignettes, the Mysteries of the Rosary, the lives of the saints, religious symbols, and architectural ornaments in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">trompe l&rsquo;oeil</a> paintings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the walls were the Stations of the Cross, which could be painted, carved wood, or molded plaster. Chandeliers hung from the ceiling. Interior design as the collaboration between architect and sculptor was exemplified by the interior of the neoclassic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">San Ignacio Church</a> in Intramuros, built in 1889 and destroyed in World War II. The building was designed by Roxas, and the interior was adorned by the sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a>. Fluted Corinthian columns, an intricate coffered ceiling, high-relief human figures at the ceiling of the transept, and a richly decorated pulpit and canopy were all rendered in exquisitely carved wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the fin-de-siecle, the Arts and Crafts Movement and the art nouveau style released the creativity of designers and artisans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction of three major churches in Manila, i.e., the San Ignacio, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/374\">San Sebastian</a>, encouraged a new generation of artisans. Among them was Tampinco, who set up an atelier in Quiapo, Manila which accepted commissions for architectural details and furnishings, such as valances and frames. Tampinco is credited with creating Philippine Art Nouveau in wood carving with his use of anahaw, banana, and areca leaves, and other native flora as motifs. His son Vidal maintained the atelier well into the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3395\">Emilio Alvero</a> who is usually credited with matching architectural details with furniture design. However, Alvero was not the only practitioner of interior design at the turn of the century. The architects <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2633\">Juan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2632\">Arcadio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2634\">Otilio Arellano</a> are known to have been as concerned about decorating interiors as well as exteriors. Arcadio designed the house of Don Ariston Bautista Lin in Quiapo around a set of Vienna <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\"><strong>sezession</strong></a> furniture. The Juan Arellano house on P. Guevarra, San Juan, Metro Manila was conceived by the architect in the Mediterranean or Italianate style. The unprepossessing foyer leads to a sala-comedor with a two-story ceiling. Overlooking the sala is a balcony, emphasized by heavy molding and pierced rails, leading from the master bedroom. The focus of the dining area, which is raised several steps, is a tall oriel window that fills the room with light. The comedor is further emphasized by a high dividing arch painted with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">murals</a>. Wrought-iron doors and even wall sconces were designed by the architect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>The American Colonial Tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the late 19th century the crowding of population centers changed the Filipino concepts of domestic space. Furniture became smaller to fit <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\"><strong>accesorias</strong></a>, which were annexes for rent in old compounds. During the American colonial period, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">apartments</a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">row houses</a> were introduced. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">Art deco</a> style mass-produced furniture sets for the bedroom, dining room, and living room became popular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2686\">Fernando Ocampo Sr</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, among others, hastened the development of Filipino art deco and modernist interiors and furnishings. The &ldquo;ambassador-style&rdquo; sala set of rattan or narra, with a three-seater and side chairs and a coffee and magazine table, resulted from this era. A typical low-slung set with strong geometric lines, went well with the architecture of the house Mapua designed for his family, as shown in photographs of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it was inaugurated on 16 Jul 1926, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a>, restored after World War II, it became the Executive House occupied by the Senate and the Prime Minister, and presently the National Museum&rsquo;s Museum of Fine Arts. It was described by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5369\">A. V. H. Hartendorp</a> (1926), editor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong><em>Philippine Education Magazine</em></strong></a>, as the &ldquo;most magnificent and impressive structure ever erected in the Philippines&rdquo; and &ldquo;the first of the great works of Juan Arellano ... The Senate chamber on the second floor,&rdquo; reports Hartendorp, &ldquo;is the most splendid hall in the building,&rdquo; with its &ldquo;carved wooden ceiling, painted in bright primary colors ... mural paintings in the impressionist style done by Juan Arellano himself, assisted by Emilio Alvero.&rdquo; The hall was also adorned with two large statues representing War and Peace, and 16 statues of the great legislators. Above the doors were busts of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\">Jose Rizal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>, and Gregorio del Pilar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hartendorp, in the Jan 1932 issue of <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></strong></em></strong>, also described the interior of the then newly opened <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, another masterwork of Arellano. &ldquo;In the auditorium, the beautiful rectangular proscenium opening is dominant. It is decorated on top with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">bas-relief</a> figures emblematic of Music, Tragedy, Comedy, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">Poetry</a>, and with a ribbon of jewel-like plaques in silver on both sides. The vision is uninterrupted anywhere by pillars or by old- fashioned boxes, and the impression of spaciousness thus produced is heightened by the clear bareness of the lightly tinted walls, ornamented only by high tapering tubes of translucent white glass in the shape of bamboo stalks which serve as lamps. In contrast, the ceiling is gorgeously decorated in deep relief with stylized fruit and leafage designs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before World War II quality pieces were manufactured by the Ortoll furniture atelier. The master carver Nuguid is said to have worked there. When he opened up his own shop, he evolved what came to be known as &ldquo;Betis baroque,&rdquo; the baroque revival style of the 19th century, adapted to the mid-20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"period\" name=\"period\"></a>The Period of the Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II Ernest Korneld, an Austrian-Jewish stage designer, became the first professional interior decorator in Manila. He was known for restrained decoration and adherence to stylistic unity. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2653\">Dr Arturo de Santos</a>, an interior designer by avocation, became known for his elegant interiors and his work on hotels. The contemporary architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\">Luis Araneta</a> did very few interiors but influenced many decorators through his own residence. Both de Santos and Araneta collected art and antiques assiduously and, by their example, led many others to do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One interior designer who integrated traditionalist and modernist trends was Rosario Luz, who had a firm grasp of modern minimalism and an eye for good period pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the designers active in the 1950s and 1960s were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2659\">Wili (Guillermo) Fernandez</a>, who pioneered the use of Philippine ethnic motifs, folk colors and crafts; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2638\">Ched (Mercedes) Berenguer-Topacio</a>, whose subdued and tasteful interior and furniture designs revealed her grasp of the basics; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2694\">Edgar Ramirez</a>, whose opulent designs were inspired by period styles; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2642\">Lor Calma</a>, whose furniture designs, like the &ldquo;carabao chair,&rdquo; were daring and sculptural. Later, Calma was associated with Gus Gamboa and Tony Cancio. Also active were Phyllis Harvey, a Russian stage actor, and her American husband Dave, originally a theater <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/56/494\">set designer</a>, who promoted &ldquo;space planning.&rdquo; Other important designers of this period are Antonio Zamora, the founding president of the PIID, and Joaquin Imperial who, after living in Spain, came home and established a successful design atelier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The innovative trend in Philippine interior design was pursued in the mid-1950s by a group of young interior designers hired by Aguinaldo&rsquo;s Department Store in Echague, Manila to upgrade its furniture section. In the 1950s and 1960s the architectural types most favored were the split-level <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\">bungalow</a> and sprawling ranch house, so furnishings had low perspective. Comfort and functionality, rather than grandeur, were stressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant designers of the 1960s and 1970s who promoted the &ldquo;mod&rdquo; or eclectic style were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2662\">Johnny Hubilla</a>, Gerry Contreras, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2688\">Edith Oliveros</a>, Sonia Olivares, and Evelyn Vales Garcia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s architects Araneta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2660\">Gabriel Formoso</a> integrated gardens into interiors. This trend was continued in the 1970s and 1980s by the Antonio brothers, Ramon and Luis. Another major influence of the 1960s was art collector and dealer Eleuterio Pascual, a conservative who championed the period style and the use of fine and old furnishings and objets d&rsquo;art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dominant trend from the late 1970s through the 1980s was the &ldquo;<em>ilustrado&nbsp;</em>revival&rdquo; style which recreated interiors in the decorative spirit of the 19th-century Filipino elite. It began with the construction of the Nayong Pilipino, a park in Pasay City which featured scaled-down models of traditional houses in the country&rsquo;s various regions. The Guevarra Foundation&rsquo;s Museo ng Buhay Pilipino in Para&ntilde;aque, Metro Manila and the book <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/9/410\"><strong><em>Philippine Ancestral Houses</em></strong></a>, 1980, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5798\">Fernando Zialcita</a> and Martin Tinio Jr, also catalyzed this trend. Casa Manila, the recreation of a late 19th-century nouveau riche residence in Intramuros, decorated by Martin Tinio Jr, marked the culmination of the trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1980s, the postmodern style with its playful allusion to classical design elements, became fashionable with young architects. Furniture in the same spirit were introduced by Eric Diaz, who studied furniture design in London; Dr Joaquin Palencia, associated with Ben Hughes of Steven-Heach, a Hong Kong design firm; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3718\">Impy Pilapil</a> and lately <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3797\">Claude Tayag</a>, furniture sculptors. Deconstructivism began to be taken seriously, after its introduction in the mid-1980s, in the store designs of Rico Ocampo and his family. Their stores&rsquo; house furnishings section has influenced the youth market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1950s, interior design has become a highly regarded specialization. Professionals and practitioners not only select design and arrange furniture, wall and floor coverings, and accessories, but also help conceptualize space for functionality and aesthetic impact. Interior designers not only help decorate a space but also plan the way a person lives and works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The uniqueness of the Philippine interiors was highlighted by <strong><em>Filipino Style</em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2663\">Ren&eacute; Javellana</a>, Fernando Zialcita, and Elizabeth Reyes. This followed upon a popular series on different regional and national styles, lavishly illustrated with full color photography, published by Archipelago Press, later Periplus, which focused on styles of houses and interiors in different countries. Reyes produced a sequel to this book, <strong><em>Philippine Style: Design and Architecture</em></strong>, 2013. Publication by an international publishing house and for the international market pointed to a growing recognition of Philippine interior design. Predictably, what the international market and audience is looking for is what is native and vernacular, on the supposition that these characteristics set Philippine architecture apart from others. While this may be criticized as an outsider&rsquo;s view that does not take into account modernist and postmodernist designs, nonetheless attention to the nativistic has placed the Philippines in international consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Philippine design enters the 21st century, Philippine-designed products like furniture for homes are being marketed abroad to an appreciative market. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3827\"><strong>Ramon N.

Among them was Tampinco, who set up an atelier in Quiapo, Manila which accepted commissions for architectural details and furnishings, such as valances and frames. Tampinco is credited with creating Philippine Art Nouveau in wood carving with his use of anahaw, banana, and areca leaves, and other native flora as motifs. His son Vidal maintained the atelier well into the 20th century."

Arcadio designed the house of Don Ariston Bautista Lin in Quiapo around a set of Vienna <a href=\"/2/4/217\"><strong>sezession</strong></a> furniture. The Juan Arellano house on P. Guevarra, San Juan, Metro Manila was conceived by the architect in the Mediterranean or Italianate style. The unprepossessing foyer leads to a sala-comedor with a two-story ceiling. Overlooking the sala is a balcony, emphasized by heavy molding and pierced rails, leading from the master bedroom. The focus of the dining area, which is raised several steps, is a tall oriel window that fills the room with light. The comedor is further emphasized by a high dividing arch painted with <a href=\"/3/15/2109\">murals</a>. Wrought-iron doors and even wall sconces were designed by the architect."

Reyes produced a sequel to this book, <strong><em>Philippine Style: Design and Architecture</em></strong>, 2013. Publication by an international publishing house and for the international market pointed to a growing recognition of Philippine interior design. Predictably, what the international market and audience is looking for is what is native and vernacular, on the supposition that these characteristics set Philippine architecture apart from others. While this may be criticized as an outsider&#x2019;s view that does not take into account modernist and postmodernist designs, nonetheless attention to the nativistic has placed the Philippines in international consciousness."

		"text": "<p>Landscape architecture is the art and science of designing and planning land areas with the purpose of adapting them to human use through the alteration or enhancement of ground forms, the arrangement of trees and shrubs, and the construction of such features as roads, walks, terraces, and pavilions. Landscape architecture is also concerned with the conservation and development of bodies of water, the design of recreational facilities, and the use of art, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> and mosaic murals. An important aspect of landscape design is visually integrating a building with its site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is now called landscape architecture developed from landscape gardening, which was concerned primarily with the arrangement of trees, flowering plants, and other vegetation for both artistic effect and practical use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The art of landscaping has a long history. As early as 2500 BC enclosed gardens were designed in Egypt. Babylon was known for its Hanging Gardens, one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Greek palaces and Roman villas were set in magnificent gardens that were described in the literature of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In ancient China, the design of gardens in naturalist style attained a high degree of artistry that influenced landscaping not only in Japan and Korea, but also in the West in later years.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In medieval Europe, monasteries maintained flower and herb gardens and used them as places for meditation. The Renaissance in Italy and France marked a high point in the development of palace gardens which were formal in style and grand in scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A naturalist school of landscaping developed in England in the 18th century. While Renaissance gardens favored geometric patterns, rigid symmetry, and an artificial character, the English gardens made prominent use of wide lawns, natural contours, and the informal, picturesque groupings of trees and shrubs. The return to nature was one of the marks of the Romantic movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 20th century, landscape architecture reached a high level of sophistication and enlarged its scope of service. Familiarity with both Eastern and Western traditions, a scientific approach to planning, and an increased concern for the larger community and the environment are evident in the works of contemporary landscape architects, who have designed school campuses, playgrounds, parks, resorts, urban plazas, memorial parks, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">new communities</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The earliest evidence of landscaping in the Philippines is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/241\">rice terraces</a> built by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>. Archaeological finds indicate that the construction of the Banaue rice terraces in Ifugao Province might have begun about 1000 BCE. The building of rice terraces involved not only the alteration of landforms but also the construction of irrigation systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Landscape design was practiced to a limited degree during the Spanish colonial period, when towns were built and provided with plazas in accordance with royal legislation. The plaza was an area of prime importance for around it stood the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>, government buildings, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\">homes of the affluent</a>. It was a recreational area and a place for celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Brambila drawing printed in 1796 shows a grove with bamboo trees well spaced in a park in Malate, where a monument to the botanist Antonio de Pineda had been erected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An 1855 drawing by Carl Johann Karuth shows the plaza in front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> enclosed by a fence and planted with flowering shrubs along all four sides. A circle of stone benches surround the statue of King Charles IV of Spain reigning at the center. Lampposts are located at the corners of the plaza, at the gate on each side, and outside the circle of benches. Another drawing shows the plaza of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a> filled with shrubs and small trees, with just enough open space for the path to the church entrance.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Landscaped areas in the Spanish period also included boulevards outside <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, such as La Calzada (now P. Burgos Drive), which had a fence and lamp posts on both sides and was lined with trees. Another popular promenade of the time was the Paseo de Magallanes along the Pasig River. Lording over it was the Magellan monument erected by Gov-Gen Claveria in 1848.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By a decree of Gov-Gen Norzagaray in 1858, the Jardin Botanico or Royal Garden of Manila was developed in a part of the Campo de Arroceros, which was along the Pasig River. An 1877 plan of Manila shows Jardin Botanico and other the parks outside Intramuros, namely, the Paseo de la Luneta, and the Campo Militar or Campo de Bagumbayan. The Luneta, so-called because of its original half-moon shape, was especially popular, being on the bay&rsquo;s shore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monastic communities in Intramuros, following the tradition of Europe, had gardens enclosed on four sides by the cloister. The gardens were planted with tropical trees and flowers. Gardens were also planted with medicinal herbs, which the friars dispensed to the people and which they brought with them on their missionary tours. The Augustinian botanist Fr&nbsp;Manuel Blanco, who published a compendium of Philippine plants, <strong><em>Flora de Filipinas</em></strong> (Plants of the Philippines), 1877, tended a garden in the cloisters of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a>. Blanco conducted many scientific experiments with the plants he cultivated there. A well or fountain was often placed in the center of a cloister&rsquo;s garden. The well provided for the needs of the community, while the fountain helped cool the garden and the rooms opening to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>bahay na bato</strong></a> (stone house) had a kind of garden in the <strong>azotea</strong>, an elevated terrace under which was the cistern. On the balustrade, on the floor, and on the steps that led down to the backyard, were clay pots with an assortment of plants&mdash;kitchen herbs; flowering shrubs, such as roses and&nbsp;<em>pitimini</em>, and ornamental foliage, such as&nbsp;<em>palmeras</em>,<em> alambrillos</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>espadas</em>, which were occasionally taken indoors to decorate the <strong>sala</strong> or living room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Down in the backyard, called <strong>laguerta</strong> (from Spanish &ldquo;la huerta,&rdquo; garden), were flower beds and an orchard with fruit trees. Flowering vines such as&nbsp;<em>cadena de amor&nbsp;</em>and bougainvillaea climbed on the wall or fence of the garden. Along its borders were shrubs and bushes. Fragrant flowers, such as sampaguita<em>, jasmin, rosal, campuput, champaca, ilang-ilang</em>, and&nbsp;<em>dama de noch</em>e were the pride of the garden. Splashes of bright color were popularly provided by&nbsp;<em>bandera espa&ntilde;ola</em>, and by the red, heart-shaped&nbsp;<em>corazon de Jesus&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>calachuchi&nbsp;</em>trees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fruit trees, such as <em>santol,&nbsp;</em>guava<em>, sampaloc, camias, dayap</em>, and&nbsp;<em>lemoncito</em>, provided vital ingredients for cooking. The&nbsp;<em>achuete&nbsp;</em>tree provided precommercial food coloring.&nbsp;<em>Caimito</em>, banana, papaya,&nbsp;<em>siniguelas, chico, duhat, mabolo</em>, and mango trees provided fruit for the table and spontaneous snacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plans prepared by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2640\">Daniel Burnham</a> in 1905 for the development of Manila and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a> included the provision of parks. For Manila, Burnham proposed a broad parkway along the bay&rsquo;s shore extending to Cavite, shaded thoroughfares along the Pasig River up to Laguna de Bay, and parks of varying size in and outside Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the American colonial regime, landscaping projects included the plazas in front of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\">provincial capitols</a> and parks throughout the country. The provincial capitols were located away from the town center and were set on spacious grounds. Some were built near the seashore or on elevated areas. The park around or in front of a capitol was planted with shade trees. A broad, tree-lined boulevard that led to the front portico of the capitol made the building look more awesome. The planting scheme was formal. Trees were planted in rows or selected trees would be made focal points, and thus be surrounded by hedges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monuments were focal points in the capitol&rsquo;s plaza and in the town plaza. Trees, bushes, and shrubs were planted around a monument to give it a backdrop or a frame. In 1934, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a> prepared a landscaping plan for Manila that aimed to beautify particularly Padre Burgos Drive; the New Luneta and Wallace Fields; Harrison Park, the area around <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/299\">Fort San Antonio Abad</a>; the Port Area; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a> grounds; the North Port Area; and Dewey (now Roxas) Blvd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of middle-class residential areas in the suburbs led to some changes in garden design. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/250\"><strong>Tsalet</strong></a></strong> (chalet), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\">bungalow</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/246\">two-story houses</a> were built on large lots that provided enough space for front gardens and backyards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the front garden were ornamental trees and flowering plants, like&nbsp;<em>palmeras</em>,&nbsp;<em>calachuchi</em>,&nbsp;<em>adelfa</em>,&nbsp;<em>gumamela</em>,&nbsp;<em>Do&ntilde;a Aurora</em>; flowering vines, like yellow bells, morning glory, and&nbsp;<em>mignonia</em>; and flowering shrubs, like&nbsp;<em>cichirica&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>milflores</em>. When space allowed, there would be wide lawns, pergolas, gazebos, and fountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The planting was of the formal type. The garden was sometimes divided by walks into quadrants, and each quadrant was surrounded by a hedge. In lawns, plants or trees were set at the center of vaguely defined spaces, and surrounded by hedges or shrubs. It was common in the year just before and after World War II to surround a house with hedges or shrubs or with potted plants. Plants were in rows or in patches, or formed circles around trees. Plant groupings were later developed as trees, bushes, and shrubs were combined in informal but harmonious arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1960s the Japanese-inspired garden became the fashion, with rocks, bamboo trees, and lanterns dominating garden design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also at this time that the first professional architects who had been formally trained abroad began their professional practice and undertook a variety of projects. In 1962, plans were prepared for the development of the Luneta and Rizal Park. The consortium of architects included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2692\">Dolly Q. Perez</a>, one of the first Filipino landscape architects with a master&rsquo;s degree in the field. The Luneta portion was partly accomplished according to plan, but the Rizal Park was turned over to the entity that was in charge of fundraising, which pursued its own ideas of park development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the major landscaping projects since the 1960s were the memorial parks that aim to be real parks, characterized by open space, abundant vegetation, and a serene atmosphere. In traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">cemeteries</a>, burial plots were occupied by structures of varying heights. In memorial parks, grave markers are kept at ground level. Monumental sculptures and tree-and-plant groupings stand out prominently. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/243\">Mausoleums</a> and tombs, which are still preferred by affluent plot owners, are given space away from the central space. In the same spirit, old cemeteries, like that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/350\">Paco</a>, have been redesigned as parks, where visitors can take a stroll and, on certain days, listen to special performances of Western and Philippine music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The malls in Makati and Greenhills began as landscaped outdoor promenades flanked by rows of shops. The name &ldquo;mall,&rdquo; however, was later given to buildings that followed the pattern of the mall, i.e., a wide promenade flanked by shops. The mall&rsquo;s vital space is the multistory-high concourse flanked by several levels of shops lined along galleries. Because of its length, height, and width, and sometimes its skylight, the mall seems like an outdoor space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ambiance is enhanced by the presence of trees and plants at strategic points as well as fountains, sculpture, and banners hanging from the roof and swaying languidly over the concourse.

In such small spaces there is no room for landscaping. So, developers have created above-ground gardens on the podium or base of these high-rise buildings.

One of the world&rsquo;s largest language families, it stretches more than halfway around the world from Easter Island, its easternmost distribution, to Madagascar, its westernmost. It encompasses the islands Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Polynesia, parts of the Malay Peninsula, South Vietnam, Taiwan, the coastal pockets of New Guinea, and, some theorize, Japan. The common culture revealed by these related languages can explain why similar features are found in Southeast Asia, namely, pile or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">post construction</a>, saddleback roof, and decorative gable-finials shaped like carabao horns. The use of piles or stout posts to raise the floor of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\">ethnic house</a> is seen, with variations all over the Philippines, both among lowland communities and tribal groups. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut) is usually built with wooden posts as its framework. The four posts of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1185\">Ifugao</a> house, which is both <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/230\">granary</a> and home, is distinctive for circular rat guards, while the Maranao <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\"><strong>torogan</strong></a> (datu&rsquo;s large house) stands on stout log posts resting on round stones. Houses built on the sea, like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> houses, are raised on slim posts or stilts. Although Philippine ethnic houses generally lack the graceful curve characteristic of saddleback roofs of the architecture of the Minangkabau in Sumatra or the noble houses at Lema, Tana Toraja, Sulawesi, their hip roofs are closely related to the saddleback type. As in most of Southeast Asia, the roof is the dominant architectural feature of most dwellings. In some cases, the house is mostly a roof, as seen in the Ifugao dwelling and older bahay kubo where the roofs are pitched more steeply than in the modern version. As for decorated gables, these are generally suggested by crossed poles that meet at the apex of the roof, although the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> <strong>sungan</strong> roof is decorated at either end of the house by a horn or crescent-shaped <strong>tadjuk pasung</strong>, generally a stylized&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">manuk-manuk</a>&nbsp;</em>(bird) or&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">naga</a>&nbsp;</em>(dragon) design with swirling leaflike&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">ukkil</a>&nbsp;</em>(carving). Longhouses used for clan or village gatherings are common in Southeast Asia. A Philippine example is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> torogan with its okir-decorated <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\"><strong>panolong</strong></a> or beams resembling a ship&rsquo;s prow (Perez III et al. 1989; Waterson 1990).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More clearly related to the Southeast Asian tradition is the function of the dwelling in a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/214\">community</a>. This is generally used for sleeping, cooking, and storing grain and valuables. For instance, in the Ifugao house a corner is set aside for the <strong>dapog</strong> (hearth) while storage shelves are placed above it. Here grain is stored. Most of the daytime activities happen outdoors or under the house, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2119\">weaving</a>, traditionally the activity of women, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">carving</a>, a craft of men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in other parts of Southeast Asia, many beliefs surround the building of a house in the Philippines. The choice of a location and orientation is important; so is the need to placate spirits. Rites of blessing and propitiation are performed in house construction. In Southeast Asia, the ethnic dwelling is sometimes considered animate and believed to be inhabited by spirits. Similar beliefs are found among the Tausug who name different parts of a house after body parts. The central and most important post, for instance, is called the navel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monuments of stone, like temples and palaces in the Asian manner, are not found in the Philippines. This may be explained by noting that the Philippines was a frontier of the Asian mainland and the Malay archipelago, and that these monumental structures were related to the institutions of kingship and to the organized religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Prehispanic Philippine society did not develop the intricate hierarchical structure or caste system found elsewhere. Much less were religions organized as in the great traditions of the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian culture was one of the influences that shaped Southeast Asia. Some Indian kingdoms, such as Pallava, stretched up to the Malay Peninsula, while the Hindu-Malayan Srivijayan empire spread its influence up to Borneo. However, Indian influence in architecture is not extant, although it remains in the languages of the Philippines, where words denoting inner states are based on Sanskrit and in the oral literature of Mindanao, which preserves aspects of the Ramayana<strong> </strong>Epic. Indian influence is also noted in the weaving tradition where cloths, called&nbsp;<em>patola</em>, follow Indian patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"islamic\" name=\"islamic\"></a>The Islamic Influence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Islamic influence in Philippine architecture came through two routes: through Southeast Asia and through Spain. By the second half of the 13th century, a few principalities of Southeast Asia had rulers who had converted to the Islamic faith. Malacca became a center of Islam with the conversion of its ruler in 1414. During the reign of Mansur Shah, 1458-77, missionaries left Malacca for Malaysian lands. Islam in the Philippines is deeply colored by Southeast Asian traditions. As in most of Southeast Asia, Muslim traders established settlements among the native population in southern Philippines. In time, they married into the native population, often taking as a wife the daughter of the local chief who himself converted to Islam. Muslim missionaries arrived to reinforce the faith. The earliest evidence of Muslims in Sulu, and possibly a settlement of Muslims, is the tomb of Tahun Maqbalu (Muqbalu) who died in 710 AH or 1310. With the coming of more Islamic teachers, the faith spread rapidly and reached as far as Luzon, its progress and deeper assimilation hampered by the coming of the Spaniards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Islam discouraged the depiction of the deity and, in general, of any human being; hence the dominance of abstract patterns in Islamic art. An example of such abstraction may be found in the okir carvings found in the panolong of the Maranao torogan and in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/234\"><strong>masjid</strong></a> (mosques). The panolong are shaped like boat prows and ornamented with patterns like the <strong>naga</strong> or snake, and <strong>pako rabong</strong> or fern. These are rendered in abstract floral swirls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Islam introduced two types of mosques: the masjid, and the <strong>ranggar</strong> in Maranao or <strong>langgal</strong> in Tausug and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a>. The masjid is the &ldquo;larger and more permanent structure, built on stone foundation, often near a stream or a body of water.&rdquo; It is only in the masjid where the Friday noon assembly prayers with the khutbah and Eid observances may be held. The ranggar or langgal is some sort of chapel, a &ldquo;small semipermanent structure built for the convenience of the faithful who are not in easy walking distance to the masjid,&rdquo; for the afternoon prayers during the Ramadan season (Gowing 1979).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the general features of Philippine mosques approximate the traditional Islamic type of mosque, some of its characteristics are peculiar to the country. The <strong>sahn</strong> (wide enclosed courtyard), for example, is generally absent; instead, benches are provided outside the mosque where people may sit and talk while waiting for the next prayer. Likewise, the <strong>mimbar</strong> (elevated pulpit) is not high unlike those of Africa and Western Asia. An elevated platform, a chair or any similar structure could even take the place of the mimbar in some mosques. Furthermore, the call to prayer is usually done not from tall minarets, but inside the mosques, like in Indonesia. Suspended drums, called variously&nbsp;<em>tabo</em>,&nbsp;<em>jabu-jabu</em>, or&nbsp;<em>dabu-dabu</em>, are beaten to call the people to the mosque. While minarets may be present in Philippine mosques, they are usually not functional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until the monarchs Ferdinand and Isabela united Spain as one country under a European ruler, parts of Spain were under Islamic rule. Islamic influence was deeply felt in the southern regions where Moorish leaders set up their palaces. A monument to the Islamic culture in Spain is the Alhambra, formerly a residence, decorated with trefoil arches, fountains, and geometric patterns. Through the instrumentality of the Spanish Inquisition, many conquered Muslims adopted the Christian faith, often through force. These converted Muslims were called&nbsp;<em>Mudejar</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThese Islamic peoples brought their own traditions to Spanish architecture, and the style of architecture that evolved from their contact with Iberian tradition was named after them. Among the elements of Mudejar are the trefoil arch, the octagonal towers used for fortification, the predilection for surface ornament often in abstract motifs, and the pierced screen. This architectural tradition combined with Spanish <strong>plateresco</strong> (plateresque) to produce the distinctive Spanish baroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mudejar elements appear in some colonial churches. A graceful trefoil arch decorates the main entrance to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Santo Ni&ntilde;o shrine</a> in Cebu, while a less than graceful one adorns the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/388\">Tayabas Church</a> in Quezon. Octagonal towers flank the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/331\">Malate Church</a> facade in a manner reminiscent of fortification. The pierced screen is found in many choir lofts and <strong>tribuna</strong>. Choir lofts with pierced screens are found in the Santo Ni&ntilde;o Basilica and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/264\">Argao Church</a> in Cebu. Tribunas with pierced screens are found in Indang, Cavite, and Argao, Cebu. Mudejar elements enjoyed a revival from ca 1880s to ca 1910. Using this style for its facade was La Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, Manila. Common features of neo-Mudejar are horseshoe arches and arabesque tracery.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"chinese\" name=\"chinese\"></a>The Chinese Influence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese trade contact with Southeast Asia is believed to have begun in the middle of the third century, and with the Philippines, during the 10th century. The Sung annals report traders from Ma-i or Ma-yi reaching Canton in 982. Excavations at different sites have recovered porcelain from the Tang dynasty, indicating trade contact by the late 10th century. Although Chinese traders had settled in centers like Manila by the 16th century, there is no indication that they built houses or temples in the Chinese manner. The skilled artisans among them were employed by the Spaniards in the construction of houses and other buildings beginning in the late 16th century. The Dominican Bp Domingo de Salazar reported in 1595 that the Chinese provided builders with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\">materials</a> such as bricks and tiles. The Chinese, in spite of many pogroms against them by the Spaniards, were essential to the architectural and artistic activities in colonial Philippines. For instance, the construction of the Seminario de San Clemente in the 18th century was entrusted to a Chinese contractor, Jeronimo Tongco. The Chinese were active well into the late 19th century, providing materials like brick, wood, and lime; and furnishing churches with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">retablos</a>, and homes with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese elements have been detected in colonial architecture. For instance, the use of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/253\"><strong>capiz</strong></a> shell windows has its counterpart in southern China, although this may be an example of countercultural influence where the use of capiz windows was perfected in the Philippines and imported by Chinese artisans to their homeland. The upward curve of tile roofs in residences is reminiscent of Chinese-style roofing. Other decorative elements are found like the fu dogs, lions, stylized clouds, dragon-like scrollwork, geometric lattice screens, and the Chinese features of many ivory santos.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>The Hispanic Influence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Spanish colonial regime, from 1565 to 1898, many Spanish and Hispanic as well as European architectural influences were introduced into the Philippines and were adopted or adapted by native builders. Among the major influences were the classical, Gothic, Renaissance, baroque, rococo, and the Revivalist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Classical or Greco-Roman Architecture.</strong> This is the fountainhead of all European architecture. Its elements, like columns with capitals, pediments, arches, and domes, have been reinterpreted in subsequent periods to produce such diverse styles as Romanesque and postmodern architecture. For many centuries Graeco-Roman architecture was normative, hence, called classical. Classical architecture originated in Greece ca the 7th century BC and there developed and flourished until about 30 BC. It developed in Rome from about 300 BC and flourished until the fourth century. In succeeding centuries, it continued to influence European architecture, particularly of the Early Christian, Romanesque, Renaissance, and neoclassic periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greek architecture is celebrated for its purity of form and sculptural character. The Greek temple, for instance, seems to be nothing more than a roof resting on columns, yet it is marked by an ingenious interplay of space and volumes. Aside from temples, which were their finest work, the ancient Greeks built theaters, council houses, assembly halls, stadiums, gymnasiums, and monumental tombs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Roman architecture, while influenced by the Greek, surpassed it in terms of grandeur of scale and structural innovation. The use of the arch, vault, and dome and the development of concrete enabled the Romans to construct larger buildings notable for the organization and expanse of interior space. Temples, forums, basilicas which were halls of justice and commercial exchange, palaces, baths, theaters, stadiums, circuses, aqueducts, and triumphal arches were architectural accomplishments befitting an empire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The characteristic feature of classical architecture is the order. In architectural vocabulary, an order consists of a column, the vertical element, and the entablature, the horizontal element, resting on the column. Greek architecture, which employed post-and-lintel construction, is described as columnar and trabeated, from Latin &ldquo;trabs,&rdquo; beam. The Greek orders were originally of timber, later of marble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A column consists of a base, a shaft, and a capital. The capital (from Latin &ldquo;caput,&rdquo; head) is the crown of the column and may be simple or ornate. The shaft, or body of the column, is round in section, and may be plain or fluted. Flutes are shallow, concave channels that run vertically all around the shaft, relieving the appearance of solidity, and stressing verticality. The shaft of the column, is given an entasis, i.e., a gentle curve tapering towards the capital, giving the effect of a slight bulge. Entasis was devised by the Greeks to correct the optical illusion that made straight columns appear slightly concave. The proportion between the diameter and the height of a column is said to have been based on the proportions of the human figure. The entablature is a decorated beam, just as a column is a decorated post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entablature has three parts. The cornice, the uppermost section, projects above the rest. The middle portion, called the frieze, is sometimes decorated, depending on the order. The lowest portion, which rests directly on the column, is called the architrave. With its three divisions defined by projections and adorned with moldings, the entablature has a pronounced horizontal character, which complements and controls the vertical thrust of the columns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the classical orders are regarded as styles of decoration, and were in fact used as decorative and nonstructural elements in later periods, they actually represent in their original form the ideal integration of structure and ornament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Doric is the simplest of the Greek orders. The column has no base and rests directly on a platform called the stylobate. Its height is 6 to 7 times the lower diameter. The shaft tapers upward to three-fourths or two-thirds of the lower diameter, and has about 20 flutes or channels. The capital suggests a square slab placed over a shallow bowl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Doric entablature is in height one-and-a-half to two-and-one-fourth times the lower diameter of the column. It is divided horizontally into three sections. The lowest, the architrave, represents the beam resting on the columns. The middle section, the frieze, is a horizontal strip with triglyphs and metopes alternating. The former are rectangular blocks with three vertical channels. The latter are square spaces adorned with relief sculpture. The uppermost section, the cornice, is a set of horizontal moldings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ionic order is distinguished by its capital shaped like a scroll. While the volutes might have developed from earlier floral forms, like the Egyptian lotus, the Roman architect Vitruvius says that since the Ionic column represents a woman, the volutes correspond to the curls of her hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The height of the Ionic column is nine times the lower diameter. The shaft has 24 flutes. Unlike the Doric column, the Ionic column has a base. Between the volutes of the capital is an egg-and-dart molding over a bead molding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ionic entablature has three sections: the cornice, frieze, and architrave. The frieze is sometimes plain, but is more often decorated with a continuous band of sculpture. One decorative feature of the cornice is the row of teeth like blocks called dentils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Corinthian column, its height 10 times the lower diameter and its shaft fluted, is the most slender and elegant of the Greek orders. The bell-shaped capital is slightly more than one diameter in height. It is decorated with volutes and acanthus leaves. Vitruvius explains its origin as follows: A basket of offerings covered with a tile was placed over a maiden&rsquo;s grave and was unwittingly set over the root of an acanthus plant. The plant grew and covered the basket with leaves and with sprouting stalks that curled under the corners of the tile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Corinthian entablature resembles the Ionic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the Roman orders, the Tuscan is the plainest. The height of the column is seven times the lower diameter. The column has a base, and the shaft is not fluted. The capital is simple. The entablature is not adorned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Roman Doric resembles the Greek Doric, except that its column has a base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Composite order, so called because it combines Ionic and Corinthian features, was developed in the first century. It has the same proportions as the Corinthian. The capital has the acanthus leaves of the Corinthian and the larger volutes of the Ionic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While each order represents a distinct style of architecture, orders were combined in buildings of more than one story, following the rule of supercolumniation or superposition. Under this rule, the simpler order was used on the lower story, and the more ornate on the upper. The Colosseum in Rome has the Doric order on the first story, the Ionic on the second, and the Corinthian on the third.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The classical orders appear in buildings of the Spanish and American colonial periods. The Tuscan order is used in the baroque facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">church at Morong</a>, Rizal. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Post Office Building</a> in Manila has massive Ionic columns. The Corinthian order adorns the old <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a>&mdash;now the National Museum&rsquo;s Fine Arts Museum and main office&mdash;and the Agriculture and Finance Buildings&mdash;now the National Museum&rsquo;s Natural History Museum and Anthropology Museum, respectively. The church of Morong, Rizal designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2689\">Bartolome Palatino</a> uses several classical orders to decorate its four-level facade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caryatid, atlas, herm, and term refer to columns or decorative elements in the form of human figures. The caryatid, from Greek &ldquo;Karyatides,&rdquo; priestesses in the temple of Diana at Karyai, is a column or pillar carved in the shape of a draped female figure and holding up an entablature. The most famous caryatids are those in the southern porch of the Erechtheion, one of the temples on the Acropolis in Athens, which was built from 421 to 405 BC. The six figures stand on a low wall and support the roof of the porch. Columns in the form of women carrying baskets on their heads are called <strong>canephorae</strong>. Columns in the form of men are called <strong>atlantes</strong>, after Atlas, or <strong>telamones</strong>. A herm is a rectangular stone post, tapering towards the base, and topped by a head or bust, usually of the god Hermes. A term or terminal figure resembles the herm, except that the human head, bust, or body surmounting the pedestal is merged with it or appears to grow from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caryatids were used in some buildings during the Spanish colonial era, not as structural members, but as decorative elements. The Bautista house in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/423\">Malolos</a>, Bulacan is unique for its caryatids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In classical architecture, the pediment is the low-pitched triangular gable resting over a portico or row of columns marking the entrance of a building. The base, called the horizontal cornice, is the cornice of the entablature. The sloping sides are called the raking cornice. The enclosed panel, called the tympanum, is decorated with sculpture, or may be left plain. In Renaissance architecture, the term is applied to any roof end, whether triangular or curved. Triangular or curved surface ornaments over doors and windows are also called pediments. Roman and baroque architecture used the so-called broken pediment, which had a gap in the apex, providing space for some ornament, such as an urn or a cartouche. A broken pediment could have its gap at the base or horizontal cornice. A fine example of pediment in the classical style is that of the former Legislative Building. Classical features are also found in the facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/329\">Malabon Church</a>. Churches of the Spanish colonial period are notable for the various forms of pediments&mdash;triangular, curved, and broken&mdash;on their facades and also on their retablos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gothic Architecture.</strong> Gothic architecture had nothing to do with the Goths, the Germanic people who overran the Roman empire in the early centuries of Christianity. The architecture that developed in France in the late Middle Ages was called &ldquo;Gothic&rdquo; in contempt of its departure from Greek and Roman classical norms. It is sometimes called &ldquo;ogival architecture,&rdquo; after the shape of its characteristic arch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction of the choir of the Abbey of St Denis near Paris in 1140 marked the beginning of Gothic architecture. From then on until the 16th century, Gothic cathedrals rose throughout France, then in England, the Low Countries, Germany, Spain, and parts of Italy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With their strong, upward thrust expressing man&rsquo;s desire for transcendence, these cathedrals are monuments to an age of faith and mysticism. This era saw the growth of cities and the rise of universities, the founding and fervent activity of the friar orders, the flowering of scholastic philosophy and theology, and the violence of the Hundred Years War and the crusades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pointed arch, the ribbed vault, and the flying buttress that characterize the Gothic style made possible wider spans between columns, less dependence on walls as supports, more spacious interiors, larger windows, and a lighter looking structure. Larger windows led to the extensive use of tracery and stained glass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With plain columns or clustered piers rising to arches and ribbed vaults, and with tracery silhouetted against stained glass, Gothic architecture is a play of lines and space, dramatized by light and color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In France, the Gothic style went through three stages: the lancet in the 12th century, so named after the pointed arch; the rayonnant in the 13th century, with circular windows and wheel tracery; and the flamboyant in the 14th and 15th century, with flame like tracery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In England, the periods of development included the Early English or lancet, from the late 12th to the early 14th century; the decorated, in the 14th century; and the perpendicular, in the late 14th to late 15th century, so called because of its emphasis on straight vertical and horizontal lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gothic survival refers to the continued use of Gothic forms during the Renaissance until the 17th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gothic revival refers to the movement and style that flourished in the 18th and 19th century in Europe and the United States (US). In England, the architect Thomas Rickman built 57 churches in the Gothic style, four of which made prominent use of iron.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gothic style came into Philippine architecture in the 19th century through the Gothic revival, which influenced both domestic and church architecture. Imported into the islands, it became primarily a decorative style characterized by pointed arches and finials, Tudor arches, spandrels with trefoils, statuary in pointed niches, and lace tracery. Verticality and height were out of the question in the earthquake belt. Still, neo-Gothic did produce meritorious designs, like the altar of Calbayog Cathedral, and the churches of Cordoba, Cebu, 1876; Bantay, llocos Sur, 1892; and above all, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo</a> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, 1868. A curiosity is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/374\">San Sebastian Church</a> in Manila, 1891, whose prefabricated steel parts were made in Belgium. Gothic influence is also seen in private houses as in the Claparols residence, ca 1880 in Talisay, Negros Occidental; the Tecson house, ca 1900, in San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan; and the Tiongson house, ca 1880, in Malolos, Bulacan. Only a few Catholic churches of the Spanish and American colonial periods were designed in Gothic revival style, such as the Santo Domingo and the San Sebastian. However, numerous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">Protestant churches</a> built during the American regime adopted the Gothic revival style in simpler form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Renaissance Architecture.</strong> The Renaissance (French for &ldquo;rebirth&rdquo;), i.e., the rise of humanism and the revival of classical learning, began as a literary movement in Florence in the 14th century, with the poet Petrarch as its leading figure. It was stimulated by the patronage of princely families, particularly the Medici, the banking dynasty that rose to political dominance. In Italy, the centers of the Renaissance were Florence, Rome, and Venice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renaissance architecture began to develop in the early part of the 15th century. The first building in Renaissance style, the Foundling Hospital in Florence, was designed by Filippo Brunelleschi and built from 1421 to 1445. Its outstanding feature is the arcade with arches supported by Corinthian columns and with medallions on the spandrels, i.e., the triangular space between the curves of adjacent arches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renaissance architecture aimed to revive the ancient Roman forms. In its early style, it employed the classical orders, round arches, and symmetrical composition. The revival of classical architecture was not a difficult task, since in Rome monuments and ruins of the imperial era were still standing and could be studied and measured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 16th century, with the development of the High Renaissance, architects exercised more freedom and creativity in their use of classical motifs. In the style called mannerist, the elements of classical architecture were used in unconventional ways. Columns, for instance, did not serve a structural purpose but became purely decorative. From the discipline and ingenuity of the Renaissance emerged the opulence of the Baroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Renaissance architecture is characterized by the rational organization of space which, on one hand, recalls the ancient Romans&rsquo;s dramatic handling of interior areas, and, on the other hand, reflects the humanist vision that places human beings at the center of this world. The design of space was influenced by the newly discovered science of perspective. An interior was so shaped that its total visual effect could be enjoyed from only one focal point where viewers could also perceive themselves as the center and measure of everything around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas Romanesque and Gothic architecture consisted largely of churches, Renaissance architecture comprised not only churches, but also palaces, villas, and public buildings such as hospitals. The prominence of secular architecture was inevitable in an age that was avowedly humanist and fostered scientific learning, invention, exploration, and the expansion of trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Italy, the Renaissance spread to France, Spain, the Low Countries, Germany, and England. The invention of movable type and the printing press resulted in the wider dissemination of ideas and the expansion of studies, while the use of copperplate engraving facilitated the reproduction of architectural drawings for wider circulation and study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Philippine architecture, the influence of the Renaissance style is evident in such buildings as the Spanish-era Quiapo Church as well as the Nurses Home of the Philippine General Hospital and the Villamor Hall, both built during the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/210\">American colonial period</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Baroque Architecture</strong>. The term baroque&mdash;from Portuguese &ldquo;barroco&rdquo; or Spanish &ldquo;barrueco,&rdquo; a rough or imperfect pearl; or Italian &ldquo;barroco,&rdquo; extremely verbose or illogical arguments&mdash;was originally derogatory and disparaged what were regarded as excesses of late Renaissance architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 19th century, &ldquo;baroque&rdquo; lost its pejorative sense when applied by German and Austrian scholars to a particular style of architecture and art in Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and Austria in the 17th and 18th centuries. Baroque, as a description of a style, is applied to architecture, painting, sculpture, and music. It is rarely applied to literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Baroque period began ca 1600 and ended ca 1715, or according to some sources, 1760. It brought to extravagant fullness what had begun in the Renaissance, namely, the revival of learning that opened the way to vigorous creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was an age of rising and expanding power. Exploration and colonization brought unprecedented wealth into Europe, raising merchants to the princely class. Nation states and powerful monarchies, such as Spain, France, and England, reshaped the politics of Europe, which had been built upon the internationalism of the Church of the Holy Roman Empire. A new kind of power was generated by the development of science and philosophy, leading to secularism. Europe had been split by the Reformation, but the Catholic Church had reinvigorated herself in the Counter-Reformation. The energy of the era was inevitably expressed in its art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The baroque vision aimed towards the unification of the arts. Architecture, painting, and sculpture were integrated in such monuments as churches and palaces, while music, drama, poetry, and painting were brought together in the opera. Architecture itself seems to have been influenced by the theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If Gothic architecture is an expression of the spirituality of the era, baroque art is the expression of sensuousness. Its opulence and extravagance aim for visual impact. Baroque architecture, while marked by the abundance of decoration, is characterized by a sense of drama, as it plays with movement, depth, and contrast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baroque space is designed to achieve a sense of movement or direction. Parts are subordinated to the whole to dramatize the total effect. Spaces interpenetrate, resulting in a sequence marked by progressive expansion. Structural elements as columns and piers are so arranged to create rhythm and movement. Walls are broken by vertical and horizontal elements, creating deep recesses and bold protrusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One feature of baroque architecture is the oval shape, or the oval as the starting point of a complex spatial composition. Unlike a circular space, which has one center, or a rectangular space, which is rigidly defined, the oval suggests movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of curves extends to the configuration of the exterior. Thus the undulating wall or the play of concave and convex planes replaces the flat facade, giving the building a sculptural character.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baroque ornament, while following the basic classical Renaissance design, namely, columns, pediment, and base, is sumptuous and exuberant, sometimes to the point of excess. Fruits, flowers, and foliage appear in such profusion as to overwhelm the structure. Pediments are broken, at the top or at the base, and the gap filled with ornamentation. Columns are twisted, indulging the obsession with movement and sensuousness. Volutes are employed for various purposes, as surface ornaments or as functional supports. As curves define baroque space, so do curves abound in baroque decoration, lending flesh-like fullness and rousing movement to its various motifs. Colors are vivid, textures are rich, and materials are declarations of wealth, gold being among them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The great monuments of baroque architecture include St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica and Square in Rome, Italy; the Palace of Versailles in France; the Charterhouse in Granada, Spain; St Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral in London, England; and San Carlo Alle Quatro Fontane in Rome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>St Peter&rsquo;s Basilica and Square were built from 1506 to 1626. Its architects include Bramante, Rafael, Michaelangelo, Della Porta, Fontana, Vignola, Maderno, and Bernini. The dome, the rear end, and the transept, designed by Michaelangelo, belong to the Renaissance; while the nave and facade by Maderno, and the baldachin, the throne of St Peter, and the colonnade by Bernini, belong to the baroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Palace of Versailles exemplifies the baroque building dominating its environment. A stunning masterpiece of organization of both interior and exterior space, it symbolizes the grandeur of secular power. Because of its relative restraint, the architectural style of Versailles is referred to as baroque classicism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>San Carlo alle Quatro Fontane has an undulating facade and a basically oval interior space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Italian in its origins, baroque underwent transformation as it encountered indigenous traditions. The Iberian Peninsula, to which Spain and Portugal belong, was somewhat cut off from the rest of Europe by the Pyrenees Range that straddled the boundary of Spain and France. A strong Moorish presence in Spain contributed to a predilection for ornament and abstract patterns on surfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Spain, baroque followed upon the late Gothic, characterized by the use of spires and ornamentation. It was baroque in spirit, untempered by the rationality of the Renaissance. Spain always welcomed foreign artists, and thus did the Italians come to work in Spain. A hispanic and a classical stream is often distinguished in the evolution of baroque in Spain. The latter, also called &ldquo;heretical&rdquo; because of strong foreign influence, is closer in spirit to Italian baroque. But a more indigenous development is seen in the fusion of Flemish and German artistic tradition with the Mudejar, resulting in a style called Isabelline, which persisted to as late as 1483. Typically, Isabelline combined Gothic forms with surface ornamentation. Under Carlos V, structural members rather than decorative motifs dominate architectural design. The Escorial Palace, designed by Juan Bautista de Toledo and completed in the mid-16th century by Juan de Herrera, a Spanish architect who spent some time in Italy, was a monument to Spanish Renaissance and a good example of the classical stream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spanish baroque was not confined to the Peninsula. A vigorous movement, it followed upon the expansion of the Spanish empire. The style spread to Naples, Sicily, and Malta&mdash;regions that were more or less politically linked to Spain since the 15th century. But its real flowering occurred in Latin America and the Orient, where it took unexpected turns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brought to Mexico, baroque produced a type of ornamentation characterized by undercutting a surface, called <strong>tequitqui</strong>. An extreme form of baroque was <strong>churrigueresque</strong>, named after the Churriguera brothers, Spanish furniture makers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common element of Spanish baroque was the twisted or helix column, the <strong>salomonica</strong> or <strong>solomonica</strong> because it was believed that the twisted column was invented for the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. While the baroque flourished in Europe, Christianity was taking root in most of the Philippine archipelago. Philippine churches were first made of wood, bamboo, and thatch, or <strong>de carrizo</strong> or <strong>ligero</strong> type, although in time native artisans developed the skill and art of carving stone and wood, following European designs. The friars, who designed the churches and supervised their construction during the 17th and 18th centuries, introduced the baroque style to the local culture, while the native artisans interpreted it according to their taste and vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While a number of churches have baroque facades, and while a greater number are adorned with baroque altars and finishings, no church of the colonial period employs baroque space. Churches were basically stone boxes with decorated fronts. The rectangular church with apse follows the basilican form of early Christian architecture, while the church with a cruciform plan and a dome over the transept derives from the Romanesque and Early Renaissance rather than from the Baroque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Baroque facades, i.e., baroque in overall form and ornament, include those of the church in Binondo, Manila and the church at Morong, Rizal, the latter completed in 1853, long after the Baroque era in Europe had ended. The three-tower facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/372\">church in San Luis</a>, Pampanga has a recessed central portion and protruding side walls that suggest baroque undulations. Baroque ornaments embellish the facades of the churches in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/351\">Paete</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/352\">Pakil</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/347\">Nagcarlan</a>, all in Laguna; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/292\">Daraga</a>, in Albay. The masterpieces of baroque expression in the colonial churches are the retablos, with solomonica columns, tightly coiled or sprawling volutes, floral garlands and festoons, discreet or lavish gilding, and veritable explosions of ornament. Native fruits and vegetation are sometimes grafted on the European transplants. Filipino Baroque ornament is inspired by both European motifs and the lush tropical landscape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rococo Architecture.</strong> Rococo&mdash;from French &ldquo;rocailles,&rdquo; rock work, referring to the artificial rock arrangements in the gardens of Versailles, and also to rocks with serrated edges of shell like or coralline forms&mdash;is a style of decoration that flourished from ca 1715 to 1790, and is considered by some scholars as the final phase of baroque, limiting the term to interior decoration, while others consider it an architectural style, distinct from baroque. While the center of baroque was Italy, the center of rococo was France. The style became popular in Southern Germany and Austria, and spent its last years in Spain and its colonies. While baroque is heavy, massive, somber, forceful, and structured, rococo is light, delicate, playful, graceful, and relatively free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While baroque is characterized by vivid colors and the use of gold, rococo uses pastel hues and the natural colors of wood. While baroque plays with planes and solids, rococo plays with lines. Rococo motifs include shells with twisted curves, crimpled shells, scrolls, flowers in garlands or bouquets, leaves and branches, and C-and-S curves. With the importation of porcelain into Europe, Chinese motifs, called <strong>chinoiserie</strong>, became part of the rococo style. Rococo architecture aimed to unify space and simplify structure. Columns were reduced in bulk and rose to maximum height, crossing the horizontal lines of the entablature. The structure&rsquo;s vertical thrust was emphasized. Arches were raised and domes were made lighter by being ribbed and punctured. Numerous small windows were provided to flood the interior with soft light. The continuity of vertical lines was matched by the continuity of decorative schemes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like baroque, rococo came to the Philippines through Spain. The earliest-known rococo works appeared ca 1780, about 60 years after the style was introduced in Europe. Rococo was adopted in the Philippines as a decorative rather than architectural style. It appeared in the ornaments calligraphers used in manuscripts, printed texts, silverware and wooden ramilletes, church facades, and retablos. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao Church</a> facade, built between 1787 and 1797, is Philippine rococo at its richest, incorporating native flora. The facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/375\">San Vicente Church</a> in Ilocos is restrained yet eminently graceful. The Argao Church in Cebu abounds with rococo ornaments, especially at the altar and choir loft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the glories of rococo are the retablos in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/387\">Tanay Church</a> in Rizal and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/270\">Betis Church</a> in Pampanga. Rococo retablos are also found in Pakil, Laguna; Tagbilaran, Bohol; San Jacinto Sanctuary in Tuguegarao, Cagayan; and Tayabas, Quezon. While in Europe, rococo had run its course before the end of the 18th century, in the Philippines vestiges of its influence appear in minor works of the early 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Revivalist Architecture.</strong> Archaeology as a science was born in the late 18th century with the methodical excavation of ancient Roman cities. History, as a science seeking to reconstruct past events on the basis of written documents, emerged at the same time. Together, the two had a profound influence on the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architects during the Renaissance and Baroque periods were no doubt deeply interested in classical antiquity. But they were not antiquarians; they took liberties with classical forms. Thus, by classical standards, the columns on the facade of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin</a>, 1604, are incorrectly designed. Their trunks are too thick in proportion to the thin capitals. Later in that century, baroque architects invented forms unknown to classical antiquity, like the twisted solomonica columns and the <strong>estipite</strong>. In contrast, revivalist architects carefully copied details from extant monuments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The classical tradition of the Romans and the Greeks dominated the 19th century because it connoted reason in a world where science and political centralization were triumphant. However, a countermovement, romanticism, soon popularized the once despised medieval tradition. Buildings began to imitate the Gothic, the Romanesque, and the Byzantine. Eventually, the historical fever revived other forms from the past: the Renaissance, which never ceased to command respect, and the baroque, which for some time was derided for its fantasies. The Romantic imagination reached out even to non-Western styles, like the Egyptian and Indian, and popularized their motifs. As an expression of nationalism, Spanish designers utilized Moorish or Mudejar forms from the past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Neoclassicism preferred a sober dignity to the excesses of baroque. It sought exact classical proportions and ornamented surfaces with correctly rendered pilasters, massed either singly or in pairs, under semicircular or triangular pediments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This movement developed in Europe in the 18th century as a reaction to what were regarded as excesses of late baroque and rococo architecture. Its earliest proponents were Carlo Lodoli (1690-1761), a Venetian Franciscan priest, and Marc-Antoine Laugier (1713-69), a French Jesuit priest. Lodoli&rsquo;s theories were published 25 years after his death in a book, <strong><em>Elementi d&rsquo;architettura lodoliana</em></strong> (Elements of Lodolian Architecture) by Andrea Memmo. <strong><em>Laugier&rsquo;s Essai sur l&rsquo;architecture</em></strong> (Laugier&rsquo;s Essay on Architecture) was published in 1753. While both were criticized and opposed by their contemporaries, their ideas laid the foundation for a new approach to architecture that influenced the 18th and 19th centuries as well as the 20th. Both advocated a rational style of architecture characterized by honesty, simplicity, and due regard for function, based on fundamental principles of design rather than on imitation of historic styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While neoclassicism advocated a break from the post-Renaissance style, it led to the revival of ancient Greek architecture, which it upheld as the ideal&mdash;being pure, honest, and simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conforming to the Greek aesthetic, neoclassic design emphasized the structural elements&mdash;columns, entablature, and roof&mdash;and underplayed or eliminated decoration. Whereas volumes merged in the baroque and rococo architecture, masses were clearly defined or simply juxtaposed in neoclassic architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Renaissance architects sought inspiration in the splendid buildings of Imperial Rome, neoclassic architecture turned to the relatively simple, colonnaded, and pedimented temples of Greece. And while the Renaissance architects used the forms and motifs of the Roman style with freedom and creativity, neoclassic architects tended to imitate the features of the Greek style, producing works that ranged from the elegant to the aridly academic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The outstanding architects of the neoclassic period and their best-known works include the following: Karl Fredrich Schinkel, the German Altes Museum, Berlin, 1823-30; Jacques Germain Soufflot, the Pantheon, Paris, 1757-92; and Sir Robert Smirke, the British Museum, London, 1823-47.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the neoclassic style had its golden age in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, its influence continued on to the early 20th, maintained by the Ecole de Beaux-Arts of Paris. In the US, the Greek revival made its first appearance in the 1820s. Neoclassic buildings there include the US Capitol, the White House, and the New York Public Library. The 1893 Chicago&rsquo;s World Fair, of which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2640\">Daniel H. Burnham</a> was Chief of Construction, featured buildings in the neoclassic style according to the Beaux-Arts standards and sparked the second neoclassic revival in the United States. Until the 1920s architectural schools in the United States were dominated by the disciples and devotees of the Ecole de Beaux Arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the neoclassic style is evident in some Filipino churches of the Spanish colonial period, it came to this country with greater impact in the early 20th century, when Filipino architects, trained in the United States under the shadow of the Ecole de Beaux-Arts, designed such government buildings as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/231\">provincial capitols</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/226\">public schools</a>. Examples of neoclassical church facades from the Spanish period are those of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/385\">Taal</a>, Batangas, 1878, and Malabon, Rizal, 1861-63, both designed by the Spanish architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2687\">Luciano Oliver</a>. Probably the most outstanding example of the style was the small but stately <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">San Ignacio Church</a> in Intramuros, 1878-89.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most notable examples of neoclassic architecture of the American period are the Post Office Building, the Legislative Building, the Agriculture and Finance Buildings, and the buildings in the former site of the University of the Philippines on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/427\">Taft Ave</a> and Padre Faura St. The identifying marks of the style on these buildings are the Ionic and Corinthian orders and two-or three-story high front porticoes evoking Greek temples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tuscan, Ionic, and Gothic columns became fixtures of private residences, whether on house fronts or drawing rooms. Examples are the ground stories of the Ilagan house in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/426\">Taal</a> or the Constantino house, 1840, in Balagtas, Bulacan. Doric and Ionic friezes became popular decorations, while lotus leaf and honeysuckle anthemia became commonplace in grillework and roof antefixes. Some houses, like the Bautista house, 1877, in Malolos, Bulacan, even sported caryatids inspired by the Parthenon&rsquo;s Erectheum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vogue for the distant in time also revived the Romanesque. When the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a> was rebuilt in 1879, it adopted deeply recessed round portals framing a tympanum with bas relief and a rose window. Similar features appeared in provincial churches such as Santa Lucia in llocos Sur. Rounded arches, embellished with interlacing vines in low relief, and large trapezoidal capitals, exuberantly decorated with acanthuses and crosses over slender colonettes, entered the houses as decorative features, although in wood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unique is the Pavia Church in Iloilo, 1899, which was inspired by early Christian Roman basilicas. Unlike most churches of the colonial period, it has a rounded apse and a deep portico with three Roman arches of equal height.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A perennial challenge was how to span the naves. True stone vaults, like that of San Agustin, were dangerous to build in a quake-prone country. One option was to hang a flat wooden ceiling, but this contrasted with the neoclassical and neo-Gothic aspirations of the facade. Another option was to simulate a barrel vault with wooden boards. The latter became popular. To decorate this, neo-Renaissance trompe l&rsquo;oeil techniques were used. Three-dimensional friezes, framed paintings, niches, coffers, columns, and pediments were painted on curved surfaces, many of them with considerable charm, some with true mastery. The painted interiors of the San Agustin in Intramuros, 1875, the Batangas cathedral, ca 1880s and the Apalit church typify this style. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">Paintings of religious scenes</a> on these ceilings were sometimes executed in the prevailing Romantic style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other Renaissance details gained currency in private homes, such as French-style quoins to contrast with brick walls, appliqu&eacute;d or incised bouquets on wooden wall surfaces, and atlantes under roof eaves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Non-Western motifs also influenced these houses. From the neo-Mudejar came horseshoe arches, solomonic stars, and arabesque wall tracery. Examples are the Insular Cigar and Cigarette Factory and the former motherhouse of the Augustinian Order in Intramuros, recently restored but now a commercial building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Revivalism&rsquo;s significance has been ambiguous. The fondness for copying dead styles, while ignoring context, has persisted to this day. During the 19th century, technological and environmental constraints imposed limits on literalness of imitation. For instance, the danger of earthquakes and the tropical heat kept houses low, emphasized the use of frame construction, and made many wide openings necessary regardless of the neo-style. But with the use of reinforced concrete and air-conditioning during the 20th century, these constraints have been disregarded. Inappropriate and uncomfortable structures have resulted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A positive effect of revivalism has been to revitalize art styles. While it began by proposing classical as the only norm, it ended up eliciting appreciation for art styles hitherto derided as barbaric, such as Gothic or Moorish. Filipino architects began to realize the need to experiment with new forms deriving from their tradition and environment. The 19th century ended with the sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> using local flora in his interior decor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>The American-European Influence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American colonial regime from 1901 to 1946, and the strong influence of American media throughout the 20th century introduced European and American styles of architecture into the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Art Nouveau</strong>. French for &ldquo;New Art.&rdquo; This international style, mainly in the applied arts, flourished from about 1890 to 1905. In Germany, it was known as <strong>jugendstil</strong>, <strong>bandwurmstil</strong>, or tapeworm style; in Italy, <strong>stile inglese</strong> or English style, or <strong>stile liberty</strong>, after the furnishings and textile shop Liberty of London; in Spain, <strong>modernismo</strong>; and in Austria, <strong>sezession</strong>, since its advocates seceded from the Academy of Art in Vienna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1895 Samuel Bing, a native of Hamburg who had an art shop in Paris, began promoting a new line of art objects&mdash;stained glass, sculpture, paintings, posters, and jewelry by contemporary artists&mdash;and appropriately called the shop Art Nouveau, the name later adopted by the movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The origins of art nouveau go back to the 1850s in England when the development of arts and crafts was promoted by the government. In France a similar movement began with encouragement from state. Exhibits were organized, societies were found, and interest in the decorative arts was promoted through publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the growing rejection of historical styles in the applied arts, artists and artisans were urged to turn to nature for inspiration. Contributing to the new consciousness was the influx of Japanese art, particularly woodblock prints, into Europe, as a result of Japan&rsquo;s opening to the West in the 1850s. Artisans also became acquainted with Javanese batik and Egyptian art, and went into studying Celtic art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The long, curving, flowing, rhythmic line that characterizes art nouveau began to appear in the 1880s in graphic art, particularly on book covers and illustrations. It later found its way into architectural ornament, in wrought-iron grilles, railings, and tracery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graceful, undulating line was especially effective in interior design, where it provided the decorative pattern for both objects and their surroundings&mdash;furniture, accessories, walls, floors, and grilles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art nouveau rediscovered the power and vitality of the line, i.e., the line as active, restful, disciplined, expressive, austere, sensuous, and unifying. The sinewy line, while significant by itself, provided a suitable underpinning for organic forms&mdash;buds and tendrils, leaves and branches, seaweed, fish, reptiles, and birds, bats, dragonflies, flames, and the slender woman with long flowing hair. While art nouveau could be quite naturalistic, it could also be abstract, exploiting the potentials of pure line and pure form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best-known art nouveau works are those of Victor Horta, Henri Van de Velde, Hector Guimard, and Antonio Gaudi. A staircase designed by Horta, with exposed iron supports, floral grilles, and swirling lines on wall and floor, is the classic example of art nouveau. Furniture designed by Van de Velde is functional and graceful, representing a somewhat austere version of art nouveau. Hector Guimard designed the metal arches of the Paris metro stations. The uncompleted Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona, Spain, Gaudi&rsquo;s major work, combines Gothic forms with animal and earth forms. An apartment building by Gaudi is daringly shaped like a giant sea rock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art nouveau is better known as a decorative style than as an architectural idiom. Yet art nouveau architecture is significant for its innovations and concepts. The preference for simple geometric forms and the extensive use of glass and metal mark art nouveau architecture as a break from the historicism of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In spite of its having been promoted by numerous exhibitions and by crusading publications, art nouveau was short lived. By 1905 it began to decline, and it survived in watered-down form. Its floralism continued to be popular in the 1920s and 1930s. On one hand, it lost ground to the neoclassic revival in the early 20th century. On the other, it also contributed to the emergence of modern architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art nouveau was hospitably received in Philippine upper-class residential architecture in the 1900s. Following the integrated approach of the style, painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3395\">Emilio Alvero</a> used the circle as the basic form for arches, furniture, and trellises when he remodeled the sala of the Tanjosoy-Bautista-de los Santos house in Malolos, Bulacan in the 1900s. Anahaw and areca palms, banana leaves, and the camote vine provided the motifs for Tampinco&rsquo;s version of art nouveau which graced many elegant homes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a> designed Ariston Bautista Lin&rsquo;s house in Quiapo, Manila, around a set of Vienna sezession furniture that the latter had brought home after a European tour. Large, asymmetrical picture frames with curvilinear and floral motifs are among the relics of art nouveau. Painted floral decorations on walls, ceilings, and window shutters in a number of houses attest to the favor once enjoyed by art nouveau in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Art Deco.</strong> From French, &ldquo;art decoratif.&rdquo; This was a style of design and decoration promoted by the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes, which was organized by French designers and held in Paris in 1925. The Exposition had more than 100 pavilions and 20 European, African, and Asian nations participating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim of the exhibit was to raise the status and expand the application of the decorative arts and to stimulate contemporary design. In line with this aim, artistic design was adapted to the requirements of mass production. The exhibit covered a wide range of work, such as glass, ceramic and metal objects for domestic use, jewelry, textile, embroidery, musical instruments, scientific equipment, furniture, and interior design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art deco, also called <strong>style moderne</strong>, reached its peak in the 1930s and is associated with the Jazz Age. Because its primary objective was the applied arts, it had no influence on the fine arts, but was, on the other hand, influenced by such modern art styles as cubism, fauvism, futurism, and abstraction. Its impact on architecture was limited to surface ornament and decorative work and to streamlining forms and motifs. It did not contribute to developments in the concepts of space and structure. It became the fashionable style for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">movie houses</a>, hotel interiors, and ocean liners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the exponents of modern architecture ruled that form should follow function, art deco advocates considered form superior to function, thereby producing an antifunctional aesthetic. Art deco furniture, for instance, could be uncomfortable and impractical. It was form and style that mattered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Art deco derived its forms partly from classicism and partly from avant-garde art. Its first phase, influenced by art nouveau, the Russian ballet, Egyptian art, and Aztec art, aimed for grace, elegance, and the exotic. Its second phase, developing in the 1930s, turned to such materials as glass, chrome and plastic, to solid rectilinear forms, and to angular, zigzag or lightning motifs. Art deco followed the principle of stylization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the US, art deco&rsquo;s influence on architecture is seen in the Rockefeller Center, the Radio City Music Hall, and the Chrysler Building. The introduction of art deco in the Philippines in the 1930s marked the end of the neoclassic dominance and the beginning of modern architecture. The style is found in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, the Central Seminary of the University of Santo Tomas, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\">Perez-Samanillo building</a>, the Rizal Memorial Coliseum, the Capitol Theater, the State Theater, and the Times Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"styles\" name=\"styles\"></a>The Styles of the Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After World War II and in the last seven decades, the country&rsquo;s ever-growing exposure to architecture from Europe and America has brought in several architectural styles that have influenced building and house construction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Modern Architecture.</strong> Something is modern&mdash;from Latin &ldquo;modo,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;just now&rdquo;&mdash;when it is characteristic of the present or recent times. Thus, even in medieval Europe, the word was used to describe whatever was new at the time. Gothic architecture, for example, was called &ldquo;opus modernum.&rdquo; In the 20th century, &ldquo;modern&rdquo; is applied to various aspects of contemporary life, to what was developed since the early part of the century, or simply to what is new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Modern architecture,&rdquo; then, refers to that which emerged in the 20th century, or slightly earlier, in opposition to historicism or the adherence to historical styles. Like modern art, modern architecture represents a radical departure from or rejection of what has been traditionally accepted or revered. Apart from that, it is, as the name suggests, the architecture of the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the term &ldquo;modern architecture&rdquo; has been recently limited to the architecture of a particular period in the 20th century, or to a particular style or styles. A distinction is often made between &ldquo;modern&rdquo; and &ldquo;contemporary,&rdquo; the latter referring to the immediate present. The currently fashionable term &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; implies that &ldquo;modern&rdquo; is a thing of the past and that a new style or concept has emerged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although modernism in architecture may be viewed as the rejection of historicism, it might well have had its roots in neoclassicism, which began as a rejection of baroque and rococo but developed into the historicism of the Greek revival. Neoclassicism, in promoting a rational approach to design and in attacking the addiction to ornament, upheld the ideals of simplicity and honesty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern architecture, in its present form, would not have been possible without the architecture of the engineers. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a> and industrial buildings, the science of construction advanced and acquired the character of art. The introduction of such materials as cast iron, wrought iron, steel, and reinforced concrete, and the new science of structural engineering expanded the possibilities of architectural design and fostered innovation and originality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Columns, beams, and arches could be less bulky and yet stronger. The size and number of structural supports could be reduced. Larger covered spaces could be created. Buildings could rise higher, and with mass-produced components, construction could be more rapid and efficient. New materials and new methods of building gave rise to new forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modernism in architecture, however, was not merely the inevitable consequence of an aesthetic and technological evolution but the dynamic response to rapid and extensive changes in society. The industrial revolution, progress in science and technology, the increase of wealth and the rise of capitalism, the expansion of cities, the restructuring of politics towards the democratic ideal, the yearning for an egalitarian society, the questioning and rejection of traditional ideas and values, and the experience of freedom or the hunger for it&mdash;all these created a new age in the history of man and a new spirit that demanded new forms of expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the new age arose new needs, and particularly the need for new types of buildings&mdash;factories, railway stations, urban housing, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a>, museums, and public libraries. The traditional forms and formulas of architecture were inadequate, if not unsuitable, for the new types of structure. A new approach to design was imperative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The revolution in form was based on a renewal of ideals. Truth, honesty, simplicity, and efficiency were the values to be embodied in a building. Function dictated form, and the building was to express its function by the truthfulness of its form. In other words, a railway station should be a railway station and not the imitation of a Roman bath. The space designed to serve the purpose of a building was to determine the outer form of the building and not vice versa. The structure that enclosed properly designed space possessed aesthetic value in itself and did not need applied decoration. Simplicity meant not only the absence of ornament but also the purity of form and the employment of only what was essential. &ldquo;Less is more&rdquo; was another dogma of design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rectangle or the box became the dominant motif of modern architecture. Structures were characterized by the interplay of lines, planes, and volumes. Spaces within the building were to be efficiently as well as aesthetically related. Indoor space was to flow visually or actually into outdoor space. Not only space but also light was to be the object of design. Thus the broad expanse of windows in modern architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building was not only properly adapted to its site but was in communion with it. The strengthened horizontal character of buildings made them appear to hug the ground. On the other hand, the vertical thrust of a structure made it appear to spring upward while rooted in the ground. The interplay of horizontal and vertical was dramatized by exposing and emphasizing beams and columns. With the movement of lines, planes, and masses in dynamic rather than static balance, symmetry was not a primary concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The beauty of a building was to result from the configuration of space, the movement and rhythm of structure, and the color, texture, and character of material&mdash;the smoothness of glass and marble, the shimmer of metal, the ruggedness of brick and stone, and the plasticity of concrete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While modern architecture is associated with &ldquo;functionalism&rdquo; or with boxlike forms, it is not limited to one style nor to rigidly rectilinear design. It embraces a variety of styles, including the romantic, the expressionist, the organic, and the fantastic, which employ curvilinear shapes, nature forms, and a sculptural approach to design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines modern architecture is exemplified by buildings, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Main Building</a>; the Central Bank of the Philippines Buildings on Roxas Blvd and on East Ave; the Philippine Heart Center Building; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/373\">San Miguel Corporation Main Office</a>; malls like the Shoemart (SM) City North Edsa Mall and Robinson&rsquo;s Galleria; churches like the University of the Philippines <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Church of the Holy Sacrifice</a> and St Andrews Church; townhouses like the Valle Verde Townhouses; condominiums like the Twin Towers and Ritz Towers; and private houses like the duplexes in Projects 2 and 3, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\">bungalows</a> in Philamlife Village, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/246\">houses of one or more stories</a> in Dasmari&ntilde;as Village and Forbes Park.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Postmodernism.</strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2668\">Gerard Lico</a>, 2008, states that postmodernism in the Philippines began in the 1980s and pervades to the present although its roots are in the academic circles of the West in the late 1960s as a reaction to the rigidity of modernism. Postmodernism is characterized by &ldquo;historical eclecticism and placing emphasis on the facade. Echoing theorist and architect Robert Venturi&rsquo;s counter-dictum to modernism&rsquo;s &ldquo;Less is more&rdquo; is Venturi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Less is a bore.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Philippines, postmodern architecture manifested itself in the free quotation from historical styles found in such buildings, as the Asian Development Bank designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, with Filipino counterpart Engracio L. Mariano and Associates. This postmodern structure returned to the use of the classical arch, simplified in geometry and detail and expressed in granite. The arch appears in buildings like the King&rsquo;s Court where the center is a four-story arch and the Pacific Star, which uses the arch as its defining shape in the tower adjacent to the foyer, also decorated with repetitive uses of the arch. The Renaissance Tower terminates in an arched pediment. The BSA Twin Towers are each capped with a pyramid of steel and glass. The Shang Tower has art deco-inspired ornaments and the clock tower at Eastwood in Quezon City is neo-Victorian influenced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Globalization.</strong> Improvements in transportation and communication, especially the growth in online communication and the Internet, have exposed Filipino architects and their clients to a wider range of architectural influences, so this influences from world architecture have become even stronger. Furthermore, the entrance of foreign investors has dictated a global look for many corporate offices. The commissioning of a design to a foreign architectural firm, which does the conceptual design, and then works with a Filipino counterpart for the working drawings, is not uncommon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnership with foreign firms like Michael Graves; I.M. Pei, Cob, Freed &amp; Partners; Kohn, Penderson and Fox; Skidmore, Owings and Merill; Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum; Gensler; NBBJ; RTKL; and Arquitectonica have brought foreign firms as active participants in transforming the built landscape of the Philippines and introducing global styles and trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graves designed World Trade Exchange; I.M. Pei, Essensa Towers; Arquitectonica, Pacific Plaza Tower; KPF, LKG Tower; SOM, Yuchengco Tower. These are some examples of a growing number of foreign-designed projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On residential projects, the color schemes called Mediterranean and Zen have been added to the stylistic repertoire. The Mediterranean style is known for its rich palette of primaries, while the Zen is its exact opposite, an austere style both in line and color. Other styles too, like the Alpine chalet with its stiff A-frame roof, or Greek Island style of blue and white with a low hemispheric dome, Italian palazzo style, have been built especially in planned and gated high end communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Deconstruction.</strong> Deconstruction in architecture, as Lico observes, results in buildings that have elements that are broken up or disassembled and arranged in illogical fashion, with no effort at harmony in presentation, and without useful purpose. These buildings appear unpredictable. An example of such a building is the School of Design and Arts of the College of Saint Benilde on P.&nbsp;Ocampo St, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Green Architecture.</strong> Green architecture with sustainable development is not so much a style but rather a characteristic of construction. It tries to reduce the impact on the environment of a built structure or a planned space by assuring sufficient open or green spaces. It also promotes the use of resource-saving technologies such as rain harvesting and water recycling, solar panels and low-energy consumption equipment, and other materials whose production, transport, and procurement have a low carbon footprint. This also involves the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">planning of landscape</a> in a building and the areas proximate to it such that spaces that can be planted are utilized. This may involve roof gardens or vertical gardens. To assure the promotion of green architecture, award-giving national and international bodies have been organized. The Zuellig Building has been recognized as the first Leadership for Energy and Environmental Desigin or LEED-certified &ldquo;green&rdquo; high-rise in the Philippines. Green architecture, however, has just begun in the Philippines and awaits more widespread and general acceptance and implementation by building owners and designers. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo D.

				"value": "Anthropologists theorize that the cultures of Southeast Asia have a common root, as shown in similarities in their languages classified by linguists as belonging to the Austronesian language family. One of the world&#x2019;s largest language families, it stretches more than halfway around the world from Easter Island, its easternmost distribution, to Madagascar, its westernmost. It encompasses the islands Southeast Asia, Micronesia, Polynesia, parts of the Malay Peninsula, South Vietnam, Taiwan, the coastal pockets of New Guinea, and, some theorize, Japan. The common culture revealed by these related languages can explain why similar features are found in Southeast Asia, namely, pile or <a href=\"/2/6/253\">post construction</a>, saddleback roof, and decorative gable-finials shaped like carabao horns. The use of piles or stout posts to raise the floor of the <a href=\"/2/5/229\">ethnic house</a> is seen, with variations all over the Philippines, both among lowland communities and tribal groups. The <a href=\"/2/5/219\"><strong>bahay kubo</strong></a> (nipa hut) is usually built with wooden posts as its framework. The four posts of the <a href=\"/4/24/1185\">Ifugao</a> house, which is both <a href=\"/2/5/230\">granary</a> and home, is distinctive for circular rat guards, while the Maranao <a href=\"/2/5/229\"><strong>torogan</strong></a> (datu&#x2019;s large house) stands on stout log posts resting on round stones. Houses built on the sea, like the <a href=\"/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> houses, are raised on slim posts or stilts. Although Philippine ethnic houses generally lack the graceful curve characteristic of saddleback roofs of the architecture of the Minangkabau in Sumatra or the noble houses at Lema, Tana Toraja, Sulawesi, their hip roofs are closely related to the saddleback type. As in most of Southeast Asia, the roof is the dominant architectural feature of most dwellings. In some cases, the house is mostly a roof, as seen in the Ifugao dwelling and older bahay kubo where the roofs are pitched more steeply than in the modern version. As for decorated gables, these are generally suggested by crossed poles that meet at the apex of the roof, although the <a href=\"/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> <strong>sungan</strong> roof is decorated at either end of the house by a horn or crescent-shaped <strong>tadjuk pasung</strong>, generally a stylized&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/3/15/2116\">manuk-manuk</a>&#xA0;</em>(bird) or&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/3/15/2116\">naga</a>&#xA0;</em>(dragon) design with swirling leaflike&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/3/15/2116\">ukkil</a>&#xA0;</em>(carving). Longhouses used for clan or village gatherings are common in Southeast Asia. A Philippine example is the <a href=\"/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> torogan with its okir-decorated <a href=\"/3/15/2116\"><strong>panolong</strong></a> or beams resembling a ship&#x2019;s prow (Perez III et al. 1989; Waterson 1990)."

This is generally used for sleeping, cooking, and storing grain and valuables. For instance, in the Ifugao house a corner is set aside for the <strong>dapog</strong> (hearth) while storage shelves are placed above it. Here grain is stored. Most of the daytime activities happen outdoors or under the house, like <a href=\"/3/15/2119\">weaving</a>, traditionally the activity of women, and <a href=\"/3/15/2116\">carving</a>, a craft of men."

				"value": "As in other parts of Southeast Asia, many beliefs surround the building of a house in the Philippines. The choice of a location and orientation is important; so is the need to placate spirits. Rites of blessing and propitiation are performed in house construction. In Southeast Asia, the ethnic dwelling is sometimes considered animate and believed to be inhabited by spirits. Similar beliefs are found among the Tausug who name different parts of a house after body parts. The central and most important post, for instance, is called the navel."

				"value": "Monuments of stone, like temples and palaces in the Asian manner, are not found in the Philippines. This may be explained by noting that the Philippines was a frontier of the Asian mainland and the Malay archipelago, and that these monumental structures were related to the institutions of kingship and to the organized religions of Hinduism and Buddhism. Prehispanic Philippine society did not develop the intricate hierarchical structure or caste system found elsewhere. Much less were religions organized as in the great traditions of the world."

				"value": "Indian culture was one of the influences that shaped Southeast Asia. Some Indian kingdoms, such as Pallava, stretched up to the Malay Peninsula, while the Hindu-Malayan Srivijayan empire spread its influence up to Borneo. However, Indian influence in architecture is not extant, although it remains in the languages of the Philippines, where words denoting inner states are based on Sanskrit and in the oral literature of Mindanao, which preserves aspects of the Ramayana<strong> </strong>Epic. Indian influence is also noted in the weaving tradition where cloths, called&#xA0;<em>patola</em>, follow Indian patterns."

By the second half of the 13th century, a few principalities of Southeast Asia had rulers who had converted to the Islamic faith. Malacca became a center of Islam with the conversion of its ruler in 1414. During the reign of Mansur Shah, 1458-77, missionaries left Malacca for Malaysian lands. Islam in the Philippines is deeply colored by Southeast Asian traditions. As in most of Southeast Asia, Muslim traders established settlements among the native population in southern Philippines. In time, they married into the native population, often taking as a wife the daughter of the local chief who himself converted to Islam. Muslim missionaries arrived to reinforce the faith. The earliest evidence of Muslims in Sulu, and possibly a settlement of Muslims, is the tomb of Tahun Maqbalu (Muqbalu) who died in 710 AH or 1310. With the coming of more Islamic teachers, the faith spread rapidly and reached as far as Luzon, its progress and deeper assimilation hampered by the coming of the Spaniards."

The ranggar or langgal is some sort of chapel, a &#x201C;small semipermanent structure built for the convenience of the faithful who are not in easy walking distance to the masjid,&#x201D; for the afternoon prayers during the Ramadan season (Gowing 1979)."

Likewise, the <strong>mimbar</strong> (elevated pulpit) is not high unlike those of Africa and Western Asia. An elevated platform, a chair or any similar structure could even take the place of the mimbar in some mosques. Furthermore, the call to prayer is usually done not from tall minarets, but inside the mosques, like in Indonesia. Suspended drums, called variously&#xA0;<em>tabo</em>,&#xA0;<em>jabu-jabu</em>, or&#xA0;<em>dabu-dabu</em>, are beaten to call the people to the mosque.

The Chinese, in spite of many pogroms against them by the Spaniards, were essential to the architectural and artistic activities in colonial Philippines. For instance, the construction of the Seminario de San Clemente in the 18th century was entrusted to a Chinese contractor, Jeronimo Tongco. The Chinese were active well into the late 19th century, providing materials like brick, wood, and lime; and furnishing churches with <a href=\"/2/5/240\">retablos</a>, and homes with <a href=\"/3/15/2102\">furniture</a>."

Flutes are shallow, concave channels that run vertically all around the shaft, relieving the appearance of solidity, and stressing verticality. The shaft of the column, is given an entasis, i.e., a gentle curve tapering towards the capital, giving the effect of a slight bulge. Entasis was devised by the Greeks to correct the optical illusion that made straight columns appear slightly concave.

The latter, also called &#x201C;heretical&#x201D; because of strong foreign influence, is closer in spirit to Italian baroque. But a more indigenous development is seen in the fusion of Flemish and German artistic tradition with the Mudejar, resulting in a style called Isabelline, which persisted to as late as 1483. Typically, Isabelline combined Gothic forms with surface ornamentation. Under Carlos V, structural members rather than decorative motifs dominate architectural design.

With the importation of porcelain into Europe, Chinese motifs, called <strong>chinoiserie</strong>, became part of the rococo style. Rococo architecture aimed to unify space and simplify structure. Columns were reduced in bulk and rose to maximum height, crossing the horizontal lines of the entablature. The structure&#x2019;s vertical thrust was emphasized.

A staircase designed by Horta, with exposed iron supports, floral grilles, and swirling lines on wall and floor, is the classic example of art nouveau. Furniture designed by Van de Velde is functional and graceful, representing a somewhat austere version of art nouveau. Hector Guimard designed the metal arches of the Paris metro stations. The uncompleted Sagrada Familia basilica in Barcelona, Spain, Gaudi&#x2019;s major work, combines Gothic forms with animal and earth forms. An apartment building by Gaudi is daringly shaped like a giant sea rock."

By 1905 it began to decline, and it survived in watered-down form. Its floralism continued to be popular in the 1920s and 1930s. On one hand, it lost ground to the neoclassic revival in the early 20th century. On the other, it also contributed to the emergence of modern architecture."

Following the integrated approach of the style, painter <a href=\"/3/17/3395\">Emilio Alvero</a> used the circle as the basic form for arches, furniture, and trellises when he remodeled the sala of the Tanjosoy-Bautista-de los Santos house in Malolos, Bulacan in the 1900s. Anahaw and areca palms, banana leaves, and the camote vine provided the motifs for Tampinco&#x2019;s version of art nouveau which graced many elegant homes. <a href=\"/2/11/2632\">Arcadio Arellano</a> designed Ariston Bautista Lin&#x2019;s house in Quiapo, Manila, around a set of Vienna sezession furniture that the latter had brought home after a European tour. Large, asymmetrical picture frames with curvilinear and floral motifs are among the relics of art nouveau. Painted floral decorations on walls, ceilings, and window shutters in a number of houses attest to the favor once enjoyed by art nouveau in the Philippines."

Because its primary objective was the applied arts, it had no influence on the fine arts, but was, on the other hand, influenced by such modern art styles as cubism, fauvism, futurism, and abstraction. Its impact on architecture was limited to surface ornament and decorative work and to streamlining forms and motifs. It did not contribute to developments in the concepts of space and structure. It became the fashionable style for <a href=\"/2/5/245\">movie houses</a>, hotel interiors, and ocean liners."

Its first phase, influenced by art nouveau, the Russian ballet, Egyptian art, and Aztec art, aimed for grace, elegance, and the exotic. Its second phase, developing in the 1930s, turned to such materials as glass, chrome and plastic, to solid rectilinear forms, and to angular, zigzag or lightning motifs. Art deco followed the principle of stylization."

The industrial revolution, progress in science and technology, the increase of wealth and the rise of capitalism, the expansion of cities, the restructuring of politics towards the democratic ideal, the yearning for an egalitarian society, the questioning and rejection of traditional ideas and values, and the experience of freedom or the hunger for it&#x2014;all these created a new age in the history of man and a new spirit that demanded new forms of expression."

				"value": "The revolution in form was based on a renewal of ideals. Truth, honesty, simplicity, and efficiency were the values to be embodied in a building. Function dictated form, and the building was to express its function by the truthfulness of its form. In other words, a railway station should be a railway station and not the imitation of a Roman bath. The space designed to serve the purpose of a building was to determine the outer form of the building and not vice versa. The structure that enclosed properly designed space possessed aesthetic value in itself and did not need applied decoration. Simplicity meant not only the absence of ornament but also the purity of form and the employment of only what was essential. &#x201C;Less is more&#x201D; was another dogma of design."

Spaces within the building were to be efficiently as well as aesthetically related. Indoor space was to flow visually or actually into outdoor space. Not only space but also light was to be the object of design. Thus the broad expanse of windows in modern architecture."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The building was not only properly adapted to its site but was in communion with it. The strengthened horizontal character of buildings made them appear to hug the ground. On the other hand, the vertical thrust of a structure made it appear to spring upward while rooted in the ground. The interplay of horizontal and vertical was dramatized by exposing and emphasizing beams and columns. With the movement of lines, planes, and masses in dynamic rather than static balance, symmetry was not a primary concern."

Mariano and Associates. This postmodern structure returned to the use of the classical arch, simplified in geometry and detail and expressed in granite. The arch appears in buildings like the King&#x2019;s Court where the center is a four-story arch and the Pacific Star, which uses the arch as its defining shape in the tower adjacent to the foyer, also decorated with repetitive uses of the arch. The Renaissance Tower terminates in an arched pediment. The BSA Twin Towers are each capped with a pyramid of steel and glass. The Shang Tower has art deco-inspired ornaments and the clock tower at Eastwood in Quezon City is neo-Victorian influenced."

It tries to reduce the impact on the environment of a built structure or a planned space by assuring sufficient open or green spaces. It also promotes the use of resource-saving technologies such as rain harvesting and water recycling, solar panels and low-energy consumption equipment, and other materials whose production, transport, and procurement have a low carbon footprint. This also involves the <a href=\"/2/4/216\">planning of landscape</a> in a building and the areas proximate to it such that spaces that can be planted are utilized. This may involve roof gardens or vertical gardens. To assure the promotion of green architecture, award-giving national and international bodies have been organized.
