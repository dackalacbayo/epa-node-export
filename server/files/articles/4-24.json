They meet while queuing for a job audition for the largest employment agency in the country, &ldquo;Aliwan Paradise,&rdquo; organized by the newly established Ministry of Entertainment. <em><strong>Aliwan Paradise</strong> </em>is searching for a unique and radically new type of entertainment (and entertainers) to help assuage the current national crisis.

The impresario finds his performance &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; and &ldquo;too reactionary,&rdquo; therefore not acceptable to Aliwan Paradise. Ligaya, on the other hand, does a song-and-dance number, singing about being a Filipina lass with simple dreams of going abroad to marry a rich foreigner. Cunningly, Ligaya seduces the impresario backstage, hoping she will be sent overseas as an entertainer. Julio discovers the seduction. Charging into the audition room in a fit of rage, he accuses the impresario of oppressing hopeless people like him and Ligaya, and rebukes the jury for their own participation. Ligaya, having a change of heart, rushes to Julio&rsquo;s side and consoles him at center stage, before the eyes of the jury and the impresario. After their emotional exchange, the impresario erupts into wild applause, claiming the scene to be top-notch entertainment, the radically new kind of show that the ministry is looking for. In the end, Julio and Ligaya, now working for the impresario, act out scenes that showcase their poverty-stricken lives.

Hassan is a pearl diver who is well known among his people. One day, his boat is attacked by Muslims from a nearby village. Together with his father and other Badjao elders, Hassan goes to their village to express their desire to live in peace on the waters around the Muslim lands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Hassan meets and falls in love with a Muslim girl, Bala-amai, the niece of the tribal chief Datu Tahil. The Muslims, who look down on non-Muslims, such as the Badjao, disapprove, but Bala-amai&rsquo;s greedy uncle is captivated by the rare blue pearls that Hassan offers as part of the dowry. He gives consent to the marriage on the condition that Hassan leave his home and settle down in the Muslim village with his bride, in defiance of Badjao tradition. Hassan&rsquo;s father disowns him, and he is forbidden to rejoin his people. But Hassan&rsquo;s love for Bala-amai is so strong that he willingly submits to Muslim ways of living, tilling the soil like the rest of her kin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, Datu Tahil calls for Hassan, asking for him to leave farming and to return to pearl diving. Hassan politely refuses. When he leaves, the chief secretly orders his men to set fire to Hassan&rsquo;s hut. Bala-amai is about to give birth and she almost loses her life and the baby but for Hassan&rsquo;s timely arrival. Hassan decides to return to the Badjao with his wife and child, but before he does so, he confronts Datu Tahil who ordered the burning of his hut. Bala-amai&rsquo;s decision to go with her husband prevents the Muslims from taking further action against Hassan, allowing them to leave in peace. Arriving in Badjao territory, he and his wife are rejected by the tribe. To appease his father&rsquo;s anger, Hassan resorts to an old Badjao custom. In full view of everyone, he throws his newborn son into the sea (according to Badjao ancient belief, the baby is worthy to live if it survives). Nobody moves to save the baby until Hassan&rsquo;s younger brother Asid finally dives into the water, followed by the other relatives. The baby survives, and Hassan is welcomed back into the clan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>Badjao </i>won Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing at the 1957 Asian Film Festival.

The Muslims, who look down on non-Muslims, such as the Badjao, disapprove, but Bala-amai&#x2019;s greedy uncle is captivated by the rare blue pearls that Hassan offers as part of the dowry. He gives consent to the marriage on the condition that Hassan leave his home and settle down in the Muslim village with his bride, in defiance of Badjao tradition. Hassan&#x2019;s father disowns him, and he is forbidden to rejoin his people. But Hassan&#x2019;s love for Bala-amai is so strong that he willingly submits to Muslim ways of living, tilling the soil like the rest of her kin."

When he leaves, the chief secretly orders his men to set fire to Hassan&#x2019;s hut. Bala-amai is about to give birth and she almost loses her life and the baby but for Hassan&#x2019;s timely arrival. Hassan decides to return to the Badjao with his wife and child, but before he does so, he confronts Datu Tahil who ordered the burning of his hut. Bala-amai&#x2019;s decision to go with her husband prevents the Muslims from taking further action against Hassan, allowing them to leave in peace. Arriving in Badjao territory, he and his wife are rejected by the tribe. To appease his father&#x2019;s anger, Hassan resorts to an old Badjao custom. In full view of everyone, he throws his newborn son into the sea (according to Badjao ancient belief, the baby is worthy to live if it survives). Nobody moves to save the baby until Hassan&#x2019;s younger brother Asid finally dives into the water, followed by the other relatives. The baby survives, and Hassan is welcomed back into the clan."

Coming from a string of failed relationships and running on empty, Tessie decides it is time for her and Amboy to move to Manila to try their luck. In their new home, Amboy forges friendships with the neighborhood kids, especially Angela whose grandmother Cedes owns the house they are renting. Tessie finds work in a shoe store where she meets and falls in love with Danny, a luxury car salesman. Despite Amboy&rsquo;s protests, Danny moves in with Tessie and provides for the family. For love of his mother, Amboy gives Danny a chance, but Danny turns out to be irascible, abusive, and violent. He eventually loses his job because of unliquidated funds, and the tables are turned: Tessie is now the provider for the jobless Danny. Michael Dahoff resurfaces, kindling hopes in Amboy about living with his father in the States. Amboy threatens to leave his mother if she does not kick Danny out of the house.

Coming from a string of failed relationships and running on empty, Tessie decides it is time for her and Amboy to move to Manila to try their luck. In their new home, Amboy forges friendships with the neighborhood kids, especially Angela whose grandmother Cedes owns the house they are renting. Tessie finds work in a shoe store where she meets and falls in love with Danny, a luxury car salesman. Despite Amboy&#x2019;s protests, Danny moves in with Tessie and provides for the family. For love of his mother, Amboy gives Danny a chance, but Danny turns out to be irascible, abusive, and violent. He eventually loses his job because of unliquidated funds, and the tables are turned: Tessie is now the provider for the jobless Danny. Michael Dahoff resurfaces, kindling hopes in Amboy about living with his father in the States. Amboy threatens to leave his mother if she does not kick Danny out of the house. Tessie finally explodes and tells her son to go away. Amboy decides to live with his father, but Michael is not yet ready to take his son to America. Danny and Tessie fight over Tessie&#x2019;s personal savings, which Danny has stolen. Danny beats up Tessie, and Amboy comes home just in time to help defend his mother from the vicious monster.

He earns barely enough to support himself and his pregnant wife, Luz. Although theirs is a hand-to-mouth existence, they find happiness in being together and having friendly neighbors who lead equally simple lives.

Knocks on the door break the silence when concerned neighbors, together with some social workers and policemen, try to rescue him from his abusive father Marcelo. Onyok is brought to a center for abused children under the auspices of its owner-founder Amanda, who learns about the child&rsquo;s inability to speak due to a damaged larynx caused by physical trauma. Still engulfed by fear, Onyok is generally aloof to people but has found new friendship in fellow shelter kid Shirley. However, violence still seems to follow Onyok when some children in the facility bully him. He eventually fights back, hurting one of them. Afraid of the consequences of his actions, Onyok once again finds himself hiding in a cabinet, this time in the nearby hut within the compound occupied by Amanda&rsquo;s brother, Ariel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A concert violinist in Manila, Ariel returns to their family house to live in seclusion after being consumed by guilt over the passing of his beloved prot&eacute;g&eacute; Bianca. Though both haunted by their past experiences, Onyok and Ariel are brought together by the violin, which becomes instrumental to their process of healing. Onyok realizes his gift of music as Ariel discovers a child prodigy. Together, they find a renewed hope and complement each other&rsquo;s need&mdash;the child&rsquo;s longing for affection and the violinist&rsquo;s fulfillment of a lost dream. Along the way, they fill each other&rsquo;s emptiness by receiving and giving love, and thereby attaining inner peace. Soon after Marcelo has shown considerable improvement in his rehabilitation, the shelter prepares a ceremony to return Onyok to his father, where he sees his son playing the violin for the first time in a mini recital with Ariel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\"><strong>Boses</strong> </span></i></b><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">debuted in the 2008 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival</a>.

Knocks on the door break the silence when concerned neighbors, together with some social workers and policemen, try to rescue him from his abusive father Marcelo. Onyok is brought to a center for abused children under the auspices of its owner-founder Amanda, who learns about the child&#x2019;s inability to speak due to a damaged larynx caused by physical trauma. Still engulfed by fear, Onyok is generally aloof to people but has found new friendship in fellow shelter kid Shirley. However, violence still seems to follow Onyok when some children in the facility bully him. He eventually fights back, hurting one of them. Afraid of the consequences of his actions, Onyok once again finds himself hiding in a cabinet, this time in the nearby hut within the compound occupied by Amanda&#x2019;s brother, Ariel."

Onyok realizes his gift of music as Ariel discovers a child prodigy. Together, they find a renewed hope and complement each other&#x2019;s need&#x2014;the child&#x2019;s longing for affection and the violinist&#x2019;s fulfillment of a lost dream.

Soon after Marcelo has shown considerable improvement in his rehabilitation, the shelter prepares a ceremony to return Onyok to his father, where he sees his son playing the violin for the first time in a mini recital with Ariel."

Her vulgar thoughts throughout the film are laid bare for the viewers. But it is not an ordinary day, for as Curacha goes through her personal ordeals, a coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat is being staged against her namesake, President Corazon Aquino. The film opens as she wakes up one morning, thinking of how the sex trade has exploited her whole body, which she compares to the geography of the Philippines.

With the help of her husband and her younger daughter, the mother finds Terya in a creek, trying to drown herself.

The title, however, may actually refer to the single unity that is the Filipino family, particularly as Diaz weaves in historical footage of key moments in the nation&rsquo;s history throughout the film. The first family, the Gallardos, are peasant farmers in the lowlands of Luzon, headed by stoic matriarch Puring. The other is another humble family of wood gatherers in the mountainous Benguet Province, ruled by patriarch Fernando, who is obsessed with digging for gold in the mountains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The character that ties the two families together is the boy Ray, who is not even a blood relative of either, having been abandoned as an infant by his birth mother on a trash pile in Manila and picked up by Hilda, a wandering, deranged woman. A deep bond forms between Hilda and the boy, whom she cares for despite her insanity. Hilda somehow manages to take Ray back to the rural farm, and he is accepted as a member of the family by Hilda&rsquo;s mother Puring, widowed brother Kadyo, and Kadyo&rsquo;s three daughters Huling, Ana, and Martina. At some points during the story, Kadyo disappears from their lives, leaving Puring to care for his daughters and push the family to earn and save enough. They work as hired hands for harvests so that each one of the girls may obtain a college education. Hilda&rsquo;s return to their home taints the family&rsquo;s reputation, to the ire of Puring. Helpless and beautiful, Hilda falls prey to some drunkards who rape and then kill her.

The title, however, may actually refer to the single unity that is the Filipino family, particularly as Diaz weaves in historical footage of key moments in the nation&#x2019;s history throughout the film. The first family, the Gallardos, are peasant farmers in the lowlands of Luzon, headed by stoic matriarch Puring. The other is another humble family of wood gatherers in the mountainous Benguet Province, ruled by patriarch Fernando, who is obsessed with digging for gold in the mountains."

A deep bond forms between Hilda and the boy, whom she cares for despite her insanity. Hilda somehow manages to take Ray back to the rural farm, and he is accepted as a member of the family by Hilda&#x2019;s mother Puring, widowed brother Kadyo, and Kadyo&#x2019;s three daughters Huling, Ana, and Martina. At some points during the story, Kadyo disappears from their lives, leaving Puring to care for his daughters and push the family to earn and save enough. They work as hired hands for harvests so that each one of the girls may obtain a college education. Hilda&#x2019;s return to their home taints the family&#x2019;s reputation, to the ire of Puring. Helpless and beautiful, Hilda falls prey to some drunkards who rape and then kill her. The young Ray takes revenge for his mother&#x2019;s death by killing the men and then fleeing the village, becoming one of Diaz&#x2019;s lost soul/wanderers, loitering first in Manila, and then in the mountains, where he is adopted by Fernando and his wife Marya, as well as their two other adopted sons, Bendo and Carlos."

Wanting to please her well-meaning mother (Bautista), Fatima decides to work in Malaysia as a guest relations officer where she meets Jake who gets her pregnant. The couple returns to the Philippines to get married, and they put up an illegal recruitment agency. When authorities investigate the agency, Jake flies to Amsterdam, leaving his wife to take the fall. Fatima is imprisoned, and her son is left to the care of her mother-in-law. While awaiting her trial, Fatima gets involved in a love triangle with two jail guards, Leslie and Oscar. Together with her fellow inmate Batman, Fatima escapes from prison only to meet up with Oscar. But Leslie is able to catch up with them and gets Fatima back in prison and Oscar suspended from his post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once in prison, Fatima, who by now is carrying Oscar&rsquo;s child, is beaten up by some of the inmates and suffers a miscarriage. Fatima thinks that Oscar betrayed her and had her beaten up. Fueled by rage, Fatima escapes and looks for Oscar with the intention of killing him. She fails and ends up begging Oscar to take her back so they can start anew. Without committing to anything, Oscar leaves Fatima in search of Leslie whom he plans to murder as revenge for his suspension; but during the face-off, Leslie ends up killing Oscar. Fatima reunites with Batman who, after all this time, is still harboring feelings for Fatima.

Wanting to please her well-meaning mother (Bautista), Fatima decides to work in Malaysia as a guest relations officer where she meets Jake who gets her pregnant. The couple returns to the Philippines to get married, and they put up an illegal recruitment agency. When authorities investigate the agency, Jake flies to Amsterdam, leaving his wife to take the fall. Fatima is imprisoned, and her son is left to the care of her mother-in-law. While awaiting her trial, Fatima gets involved in a love triangle with two jail guards, Leslie and Oscar. Together with her fellow inmate Batman, Fatima escapes from prison only to meet up with Oscar.

She fails and ends up begging Oscar to take her back so they can start anew. Without committing to anything, Oscar leaves Fatima in search of Leslie whom he plans to murder as revenge for his suspension; but during the face-off, Leslie ends up killing Oscar.

He is tied to a tree in a forest and left to starve and die, exposed to wild beasts. A wandering Moor, Aladin, hears his cries and saves him from two fierce lions. Florante, who fainted when the lions attacked, regains consciousness and is surprised to find that the person who saved him is an enemy.

Upon his arrival, he was arrested by the treacherous Adolfo who had already seized the throne from King Linceo. Adolfo also had designs on Linceo&rsquo;s daughter and Florante&rsquo;s sweetheart, Laura. Aladin, on the other hand, was banished by his father, the ruler of Persia, who wanted Aladin&rsquo;s sweetheart, Flerida, for himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unknown to Florante and Aladin, their sweethearts are in another part of the forest.

The Chinese-Filipino siblings, who were in their early 20s, were waiting for their ride home at Ayala Center in Cebu when six men forcibly dragged them inside a vehicle and took them to Guadalupe, a nearby town. Days later, Marijoy&rsquo;s remains were recovered down a ravine in Carcar, Cebu.

The media focused its attention on Francisco &ldquo;Paco&rdquo; Larra&ntilde;aga, who was then a 19-year-old culinary arts student in Manila. With his brawny physique, record of petty misdeeds, and connection to the Osme&ntilde;a political clan, the Spanish mestizo was perfect for a role he didn&rsquo;t sign up for: an unrepentant hoodlum using his privilege to literally get away with murder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><strong>Give Up Tomorrow</strong> </i></b> presents Larra&ntilde;aga&rsquo;s side of the story, and viewers learn early on that producer Marty Syjuco is a relative&mdash;a necessary disclosure. While accusations of bias seem inevitable, <b><i>Give Up Tomorrow</i></b> relies on documentary evidence, personal testimonies, and archival footage to prove its points. As a result, it cobbles together a convincing, disquieting picture of how Larra&ntilde;aga, despite his obvious advantages, became a victim of an incredibly corrupt political system and a whipping boy of crumbling social institutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 3 Feb 2004, the so-called Chiong Seven were convicted of murder and sentenced to death by lethal injection. In 2006, however, capital punishment was abolished, so their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment. By 2009, Larra&ntilde;aga was housed in a Spanish jail, a move made possible under the Treaty on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which both the Philippines and Spain signed. Larra&ntilde;aga, who holds dual Filipino and Spanish citizenship, was eligible to benefit from the agreement. Of course, what was a small triumph for the Larra&ntilde;agas was a major blow for the Chiongs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than an expos&eacute; on how the carriage of justice can go awry, the film is a tale of families valiantly carrying on despite their unbearable losses.

In time, Carding gains notoriety as a most notorious and wanted criminal, the terror of his province."

But the infant dies, and when Carding&#x2019;s brother, Miguel, also dies, Carding goes on a killing rampage. Inevitably, Carding and Ben meet face-to-face.

Under the leadership of the Supremo, the Colorum peasants attack their landlords at the latter&rsquo;s decadent <i>baile<b> </b></i>(dance). The rebels capture the town&rsquo;s armory, kill Don Sebastian, and take over the town. Victory is fleeting, however, for soon well-armed government troops, led by an American officer, arrive. Against Ruben&rsquo;s rational advice, the Supremo attacks these troops with bolo and <i>anting-anting<b> </b></i>(talisman). A massacre follows and the remaining Colorums limp their way to their church. Ruben and his men take away the body of the Supremo. The townspeople mistakenly believe that the Supremo has resurrected. Ruben disabuses their minds of such superstition&mdash;and all superstitions&mdash;convincing the mob that power grows out of unity and arms, and not out of miracles and talismans. As he speaks, government troops arrive, round up the rest of the Colorums, parade Ruben around town on a bullcart as a &ldquo;<i>huwad na bayani</i>&rdquo; (fake hero), and tie him to the same stone base where the Supremo&rsquo;s corpse was exhibited. Ruben is mocked by the fickle mob. But once pardoned by the government, Ruben rises, talks to his fellow peasants, and then leads them into the sunrise of a new beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i>Hubad </i></b>is significant for its sympathetic but objective portrayal of peasant revolts, and its statement that social change can be effected not with anting-anting but by the unity of all peasants. In the 1978 Gawad Urian, it won Best Film, Best Screenplay, and Best Production Design, and was nominated for Best Director, Best Actor (Arevalo), Best Supporting Actress (Ramirez), Best Cinematography, and Best Editing. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by</strong> </em><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

Against Ruben&#x2019;s rational advice, the Supremo attacks these troops with bolo and <i>anting-anting<b> </b></i>(talisman). A massacre follows and the remaining Colorums limp their way to their church. Ruben and his men take away the body of the Supremo. The townspeople mistakenly believe that the Supremo has resurrected. Ruben disabuses their minds of such superstition&#x2014;and all superstitions&#x2014;convincing the mob that power grows out of unity and arms, and not out of miracles and talismans. As he speaks, government troops arrive, round up the rest of the Colorums, parade Ruben around town on a bullcart as a &#x201C;<i>huwad na bayani</i>&#x201D; (fake hero), and tie him to the same stone base where the Supremo&#x2019;s corpse was exhibited. Ruben is mocked by the fickle mob. But once pardoned by the government, Ruben rises, talks to his fellow peasants, and then leads them into the sunrise of a new beginning."

Shot on the fringes of Punta Dumalog, near the coast of Davao City, the film is set in and around the sewers, where people loaf around, talk, smoke, drink, sleep, and even die. The sewers embody a bleak reality that is inhabited and used as refuge by many people. The only semblance of narrative and point of view are anchored on the wanderings of the young boys, Allen and Joel, who see most of what goes on in and around the sewers. They are young enough to be interested in playing games, but the sewer, their &ldquo;second home,&rdquo; is not the best place for children. They are cared for by Gigi, the only adult around, but she is not exactly the best mother for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"letter-spacing:.15pt\">The long takes and stretches of silence and plotlessness give the impression that nothing is happening. But instead of doing nothing exactly, the young people are doing something. They curse, talk about sex, masturbate, engage in public sex, watch others having sex, collect cockroaches in jars, and swim in the filthy waters. The provocative images are further distorted by abstractions in the cinematography and editing, such as when shots are deliberately blurred or when frames are frozen. The imagery functions as a counterpoint to the reputation of Davao City as safe and clean.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:.15pt\">Imburnal</span></i></b><span style=\"letter-spacing:.15pt\"> won Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Cinematographyin the 2008 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4335\">Cinema One Originals Digital Film Festival </a>and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> Grand Prize in the 2008 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4337\">Cinemanila International Film Festival</a>.

				"value": "<b><i><strong>Imburnal</strong> </i></b> is a three-and-a-half-hour non-narrative film that intertwines poverty and sexuality. Shot on the fringes of Punta Dumalog, near the coast of Davao City, the film is set in and around the sewers, where people loaf around, talk, smoke, drink, sleep, and even die. The sewers embody a bleak reality that is inhabited and used as refuge by many people. The only semblance of narrative and point of view are anchored on the wanderings of the young boys, Allen and Joel, who see most of what goes on in and around the sewers. They are young enough to be interested in playing games, but the sewer, their &#x201C;second home,&#x201D; is not the best place for children. They are cared for by Gigi, the only adult around, but she is not exactly the best mother for them."

But instead of doing nothing exactly, the young people are doing something. They curse, talk about sex, masturbate, engage in public sex, watch others having sex, collect cockroaches in jars, and swim in the filthy waters. The provocative images are further distorted by abstractions in the cinematography and editing, such as when shots are deliberately blurred or when frames are frozen. The imagery functions as a counterpoint to the reputation of Davao City as safe and clean.</span>"

As Rizal&rsquo;s voice narrates the story of Spanish abuses in the country, the narrative comes to life, in black and white, with the main character Simoun articulating Rizal&rsquo;s own thoughts about the current situation in Spanish Philippines. Meanwhile, Rizal&rsquo;s first novel, <b><i><strong> <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></a> </strong> </strong> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"> </a></i></b>(Touch Me Not), has already motivated the discontented locals, headed by Andres Bonifacio, to start the separatist Katipunan movement.

Upon the completion of <b><i>El Filibusterismo </i></b>and his subsequent return to the country in 1892, Rizal is captured and detained.

This back-and-forth action in the narrative also reflects Rizal&rsquo;s indecision about the resolution of his second novel, as cinematically illustrated in the scene where Rizal debates with his alter-ego, Simoun. The movie ends with the execution of Rizal in Bagumbayan, followed by a quick scene showing <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>&nbsp;and the Katipuneros as they plan their next move against the Spaniards, with Rizal&rsquo;s photograph prominently hung in the Katipunan headquarters.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">First shown locally in June 1998 to coincide with the celebrations of the centennial of the Philippine Revolution, the film was subsequently shown during the Metro Manila Film Festival (MMFF) later that year.

Grateful to Juan for saving his life, the sultan anoints Juan as his successor. Because of this, Juan and his family take on the airs and manners of &ldquo;hay sosayti&rdquo; (high society). More importantly, Juan becomes the target of ambitious women looking for a husband, especially Ganid-a (greedy), the daughter of Sobhra (excessive) whose lifestyle pushes her husband Sikatdao (supposedly famous) to desperation. At Ganid-a&rsquo;s lavish debut, a fashion show, satirizing contemporary women&rsquo;s clothes, is staged. Ganid-a invites Juan to the debut, hoping to ensnare him there, but Juan instead notices and falls for Karani, a pretty girl who is against the social-climbing ways of her own mother Inggiteray (envious).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of his stature, the matrons of the Family First Association invite Juan to chair their fund-raising beauty contest through which they intend to raise 30,000 pesos, half of which will be donated to the youth hospital.

Ganid-a, Karani, and even Juan&rsquo;s sister Leah are forced to run by their social-climbing mothers, together with other contestants. Juan promises to support Ganid-a and Karani.

Inadvertently, the tape lands in the pocket of Johnny, a young Filipino returning from Japan. The young man, his girl Melanie, and their friends Nonong and Nancy, who are also lovers, are hounded by the Japanese who seek to recover the contraband. The Chinese agents are also hot on their trail. Running for their lives, the lovers reach Baguio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hoping to find refuge, the lovers enter a church, only to find out that it is the headquarters of the Japanese syndicate. They uncover a plot by the syndicate to use fake priests and nuns for the large-scale distribution of opium in the country. The scheme is supposed to put the country under Japanese control. Finally, the Chinese agents penetrate the Japanese headquarters and a riotously funny battle ensues: the Chinese against the Japanese and both against the Filipinos.

As the night wears on, Abyong asks Peping to join him in a job supervised by Kap and Sarge. Hoping to earn some money, Peping joins them. Little does he know that the job is the kidnapping of a prostitute named Madonna, who has refused to pay her debts to Kap&rsquo;s group. Gagged inside the van, Madonna is beaten up, much to the shock of Peping who stays quiet in the backseat. The group brings the woman to a &ldquo;safehouse&rdquo; outside Manila. All this time Peping is silent, fearful of the company he keeps. Kap asks the boys to buy some beer at a nearby store. As Peping wanders off from Abyong and the others, he sees a bus waiting for passengers at a nearby terminal. Peping boards the bus, but his attempt to escape is interrupted by a phone call from Abyong, wondering where he has gone. Peping returns to the men and is given a gun, apparently a gift from Kap. The men go back to the safehouse, and Peping is asked to keep watch over Madonna. After a short while, one of the men enters the room and rapes Madonna. Then she is murdered and chopped to pieces. Peping helps the men clean up the crime scene; then they all leave the house and go back to the city, throwing body parts along the way. The group eats breakfast at a small restaurant; Peping excuses himself to go to the bathroom where he throws up. He then asks Kap&rsquo;s permission to leave so he can finally go home. Kap gives him some money and Peping hails a cab. As Peping dozes off inside the taxi, a loud popping sound wakes him up. The cab has a flat tire.

As the night wears on, Abyong asks Peping to join him in a job supervised by Kap and Sarge. Hoping to earn some money, Peping joins them. Little does he know that the job is the kidnapping of a prostitute named Madonna, who has refused to pay her debts to Kap&#x2019;s group. Gagged inside the van, Madonna is beaten up, much to the shock of Peping who stays quiet in the backseat. The group brings the woman to a &#x201C;safehouse&#x201D; outside Manila. All this time Peping is silent, fearful of the company he keeps. Kap asks the boys to buy some beer at a nearby store. As Peping wanders off from Abyong and the others, he sees a bus waiting for passengers at a nearby terminal. Peping boards the bus, but his attempt to escape is interrupted by a phone call from Abyong, wondering where he has gone. Peping returns to the men and is given a gun, apparently a gift from Kap. The men go back to the safehouse, and Peping is asked to keep watch over Madonna. After a short while, one of the men enters the room and rapes Madonna. Then she is murdered and chopped to pieces. Peping helps the men clean up the crime scene; then they all leave the house and go back to the city, throwing body parts along the way. The group eats breakfast at a small restaurant; Peping excuses himself to go to the bathroom where he throws up. He then asks Kap&#x2019;s permission to leave so he can finally go home. Kap gives him some money and Peping hails a cab. As Peping dozes off inside the taxi, a loud popping sound wakes him up. The cab has a flat tire. Peping realizes that his gun is still inside his bag; he tries to flag other rides to no avail. The taxi driver replaces his tire and Peping rides back with him. The movie ends with Peping&#x2019;s wife Cecille cooking breakfast while taking care of their child.</span>"

She wants a more permanent relationship with Bobby, but Bobby refuses to commit himself and leaves her. Selya runs away to look for Bobby and ends up in a small town that Bobby frequently visits. There she meets Piling, a schoolteacher who also takes care of Dave, a closeted gay man who serves as the principal of the school owned by his family. Dave is secretly in a sexual relationship with Carding, making them the subject of vicious gossip among the homophobic townsfolk. Realizing that Selya does not know anything about Dave, Piling sets Selya up with Dave. Selya feels that things won&#x2019;t end well as Dave is not interested in a sexual relationship, so she walks out on him even as he proposes to her. Selya goes back to Bobby, only to regret her decision when he gets her pregnant but refuses to change his philandering ways. Selya decides to return with her child to Dave, and Dave welcomes both of them back with open arms.</span>"

Ian, the son of a shipping tycoon, becomes a successful real estate businessman in his own right. When his mother leaves them, Ian is driven by the desire to be more successful than his father, whose continuing love for his mother Ian could not understand and forgive. And yet, deep inside, he yearns for his father&rsquo;s approval and the stability of his love. On a business trip to Macau, Ian meets Karyn, a flight attendant, who allows him to be spontaneous and carefree. For the first time he feels loved. They eventually marry. But Ian craves the constancy of domesticity, which Karyn cannot seem to satisfy.

Luis rises to become a mogul and owner of a food-manufacturing conglomerate, which, on his 80th birthday, is now run by his son, Daniel. Luis has three granddaughters: Vera, the iron-fisted chief executive officer of the Go Group of Companies; Juliet, housewife of a tough husband, Joseph; and Richelle, the rebellious and disfavored granddaughter. Each granddaughter has to contend with her own problem. Vera&rsquo;s dilemma is whether to marry Emerson or not. Juliet gets involved in the rescue of a kidnapped child. And Richelle, whose conflict puts the whole clan in a precarious situation, is arrested in a drug raid and, with the help of detective Raf, is made an informant against the corrupt police commissioner, who is a close friend of Luis. Richelle chooses to do the right, albeit dangerous, thing.

Luis Go is the patriarch who defied his family in Fujian in order to live in the Philippines with his Filipino wife, Eliza. Luis rises to become a mogul and owner of a food-manufacturing conglomerate, which, on his 80th birthday, is now run by his son, Daniel. Luis has three granddaughters: Vera, the iron-fisted chief executive officer of the Go Group of Companies; Juliet, housewife of a tough husband, Joseph; and Richelle, the rebellious and disfavored granddaughter. Each granddaughter has to contend with her own problem. Vera&#x2019;s dilemma is whether to marry Emerson or not. Juliet gets involved in the rescue of a kidnapped child. And Richelle, whose conflict puts the whole clan in a precarious situation, is arrested in a drug raid and, with the help of detective Raf, is made an informant against the corrupt police commissioner, who is a close friend of Luis. Richelle chooses to do the right, albeit dangerous, thing. But her act of courage pulls the family closer together.</span>"

Teban belongs to a poor family. Upon reaching home, he learns that he has a guest, Lisa, a young woman from a rich family who wants to hire Teban so that she and Teban can pretend to be lovers and she can avoid the marriage that her family has fixed for her to a man she does not love. Because of the financial reward, Teban agrees. Together, Teban and Lisa go to the house of Lisa&rsquo;s parents where Teban is introduced as her lover. But Lisa&rsquo;s father explains why he wants to marry her off: her groom-to-be is the son of a wealthy business friend to whom he owes a substantial amount of money. The businessman tells Teban&rsquo;s parents that their debt to him will be waived if Teban gives up Lisa so that she can marry his son. Teban and Lisa refuse to heed the businessman&rsquo;s offer. This forces Lisa&rsquo;s father to plot Teban&rsquo;s death in various ways. The first plot involves hired men who are supposed to kill Teban in a boxing match. But Lisa interferes as soon as she hears the plan: she also hires men who will stop the planned murder of Teban. The second plot, however, suceeds. Teban drowns when he is thrown into the sea. Teban meets San Pedro in the afterlife and the saint tells him that he needs to go back to the world as his time is not yet up. San Pedro gives Teban a rooster and Teban soon wakes up on the shore with the rooster beside him. Not long after, Teban learns that the rooster can speak. The bird also begins to bring him fame and fortune by winning every cockfighting match that it joins. Teban becomes extremely arrogant, to the disappointment of many of the people who know him, including Lisa. One day, Teban loses a cockfighting match because the rooster that San Pedro gave him was replaced. Later, he realizes that the bird that won over the replacement was the rooster that San Pedro gave him. Meanwhile, Lisa is kidnapped by the wealthy businessman. Teban surrenders all his money in exchange for Lisa&rsquo;s freedom. However, Teban is shot by the businessman. Upon meeting San Pedro once more, Teban learns that the businessman also died when his plane crashed. The old man is sent to hell and Teban is sent to heaven. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\"><strong>Ang Manok ni San Pedro</strong> </span></i></b><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\">was the first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> full-length comedy that used the Super 8 format, a home-movie film that turned out to be a worthwhile investment for the Arong brothers as the film grossed over 10 times more than their initial investment in it at the end of its first week in the cinema. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span></span><em><strong>Written by</strong> </em><em><strong><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.2pt\">Johann Vladimir J.

While in Cebu, Luna is always carrying around a camera, which she drops in the sea. When a vehicular accident befalls Alex and blinds him, he reneges on his promise to marry Luna. Luna returns to Cebu to recover the camera in an attempt to prove to Alex that her love has not waned despite his blindness. The search for the camera reconnects Luna and Jerry, only to confirm that Jerry&#x2019;s feelings toward Luna will remain unrequited. As Jerry endeavors to find the camera for Luna, he learns to let go and not to expect anything in return, to forgive his father, and to open up his heart to a new love. The film closes with images from the recovered camera, candid and fragile pictures of momentary joys and beauty, taken by Luna in her sojourn to Cebu.</span>"

Coming from a middle-class Manila family, Ria tries to adjust to her new life in Mulanay: the power disruptions in the evening, the lack of basic medical supplies, the lack of funds to maintain cleanliness in the barangay, and the persistent problem of diarrhea and malnutrition in the community. Aside from being a doctor, Ria realizes that she needs to be an all-around superwoman&mdash;an environmental officer, an adult education officer, as well as a fund-raiser&mdash;to be able to fully serve the needs of the people. Ria is soon made aware of the bureaucracy in the local government as she tries to raise money to fund the construction of several deep wells in the barrio. Mulanay, with the help of their one and only doctor, attempts to deal with the growing epidemic that has been spreading across the barrio, resulting in the serious illness of many children and the death of Norma&rsquo;s son. After the tragedy, the local government recognizes the epidemic and sends medical supplies to Mulanay.

She was assigned to Mulanay, a fishing village in Quezon, where she meets and is guided around town by the midwife Norma. Coming from a middle-class Manila family, Ria tries to adjust to her new life in Mulanay: the power disruptions in the evening, the lack of basic medical supplies, the lack of funds to maintain cleanliness in the barangay, and the persistent problem of diarrhea and malnutrition in the community. Aside from being a doctor, Ria realizes that she needs to be an all-around superwoman&#x2014;an environmental officer, an adult education officer, as well as a fund-raiser&#x2014;to be able to fully serve the needs of the people. Ria is soon made aware of the bureaucracy in the local government as she tries to raise money to fund the construction of several deep wells in the barrio. Mulanay, with the help of their one and only doctor, attempts to deal with the growing epidemic that has been spreading across the barrio, resulting in the serious illness of many children and the death of Norma&#x2019;s son. After the tragedy, the local government recognizes the epidemic and sends medical supplies to Mulanay. While her plans of constructing deep wells in the community are not realized due to lack of funds, Ria is able to build a small drugstore, thanks to the financial assistance of her mother. Tired of all the government bureaucracy, Ria decides to leave the town for good to pursue her own dreams, but not after a grand send-off from the townsfolk who accompany her as she visits one last time the office of the mayor in an attempt to explain the plight of the people of Mulanay."

They come to know each other one night in the midst of a heavy downpour, during which they find themselves stranded by a flash flood. The unlikely friendship that arises between the two, particularly in view of the vast differences in their class, status, and age, soon develops into a torrid romance that is not without maternal undertones. Such a liaison, however, is not looked upon with favor by their family members, friends, and associates, particularly Rica, who is in love with Noah. The couple are subjected to various pressures that threaten to tear their apparently scandalous relationship apart. Things come to a head when Dorinda realizes that, notwithstanding her years, she is pregnant. Noah takes her to the province to live with a relative, but he must still return to the city to work and earn for his mother and siblings, a decision that leads him down the same path that ended his father&rsquo;s life.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Naglalayag </span></i></b><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Story, Best Screenplay, Best Actor (Servo), Best Actress (Aunor), Best Supporting Actress (Jose), Best Musical Score, and Best Theme Song at the 2004 Manila Film Festival.

They come to know each other one night in the midst of a heavy downpour, during which they find themselves stranded by a flash flood. The unlikely friendship that arises between the two, particularly in view of the vast differences in their class, status, and age, soon develops into a torrid romance that is not without maternal undertones. Such a liaison, however, is not looked upon with favor by their family members, friends, and associates, particularly Rica, who is in love with Noah. The couple are subjected to various pressures that threaten to tear their apparently scandalous relationship apart. Things come to a head when Dorinda realizes that, notwithstanding her years, she is pregnant. Noah takes her to the province to live with a relative, but he must still return to the city to work and earn for his mother and siblings, a decision that leads him down the same path that ended his father&#x2019;s life.</span>"

This difficult but manageable arrangement is soon thrown into shambles when Mombic, Merced&#x2019;s brother, arrives with the intention of leaving his young son, Antony, to the care of his mother and sister, as he intends to work abroad. Worse, Gaspar&#x2019;s condition deteriorates and he slips into a coma. This compels Raquel, Gaspar&#x2019;s daughter, to return from the United States with the objective of selling the beloved ancestral mansion that her relatives presently occupy, over Celia&#x2019;s vehement objections, but in connivance with Mombic. As grudges, grievances, and secrets, long nursed and kept, spill out and deepen the rifts within the family, Celia can only pray for a miracle. In final bid to rouse her brother, she organizes a <em>tertulia&#xA0;</em>(social gathering) with her fellow opera singers, placing her hopes in the power of music and her fervent devotion to the Santo Ni&#xF1;o (Infant Jesus), whom her grandson Antony imitates at play. </span>"

The documentary deals with how the gay impersonator/performer by night manages to be a devoted husband/father by day. Oliver lives with a laundrywoman and their child in Manila&rsquo;s poorest district, Tondo. The documentary depicts the sharp visual and psychological contrasts between Ermita&rsquo;s nightclub row and Oliver&rsquo;s life in Tondo.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">Deocampo&rsquo;s film underscores the dismal reality of gay prostitution as it exists in places like Ermita. As if in a public confessional, the main character speaks to the audience about his life and work as a homosexual prostitute.

Oliver lives with a laundrywoman and their child in Manila&#x2019;s poorest district, Tondo.

The young man disguises himself as a poor farmer to make sure that the girl is not just after his money or his name. Later, he discovers that his own father is his rival for the hand of the young lady.

Born to a poor family, Pepot helps his parents by selling <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><i>komiks</i></a> in their neighborhood.

Hoping to get the lead part, Pepot is disappointed that he is cast as the lion in the production, much to the amusement of his classmates. In between classes, Pepot whiles away his free time watching movies with his best friend Denggoy, as he continues to daydream about making it big in the entertainment industry. Meanwhile, his father leaves the family to work abroad, only to come home unsuccessful, as he was victimized by an illegal recruiter who promised him a job in Saudi Arabia. To drown his sorrows, the father holds a drinking session with his neighbors, with Pepot&rsquo;s pet pigeons as <i>pulutan </i>(appetizer). Angry with his father, Pepot leaves his family and finds a temporary home in the fair, under the care of carnival performers Nora and Tirso who encourage Pepot to follow his dreams. Learning that a film director is on the lookout for young actors, Pepot goes about preparing for his audition. He goes back home to ask money from his mother so he can buy new clothes, but he loses all the money, no thanks to his bestfriend, in a game of <i>cara y cruz </i>(head or tail). Taking pity on the kid, Tirso and Nora, with the help of the carnival fortune-teller, Madam Hulatsky, sew a new wardrobe for Pepot and accompany him to his audition. Unfortunately, the director is not too keen on auditioning the kids, including Pepot, saying that the children do not look the part. Heartbroken, Pepot returns home to his pigeons, only to vanish without a trace eventually. In the end, the writer reveals that Pepot, while now a mere memory, is still with us&mdash;from karaoke corners to barangay singing contests, for Pepot Artista is the symbol of the country&rsquo;s fascination with popular entertainment and escapist fantasy.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The film won the Balanghai trophy for Best Editing and Best Film in the 2005 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival</a>, the Silver Screen Award for Best Actor (Castillo) in the Singapore International Film Festival, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4598\">PMPC</a> Star Award for Child Performer of the Year (Castillo). <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span></span><em><strong>Written by</strong> </em><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\"><em><strong>Anne Frances Sangil</strong> </em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Born to a poor family, Pepot helps his parents by selling <a href=\"/9/73/1554\"><i>komiks</i></a> in their neighborhood. While not an exceptionally bright student, Pepot participates in his school play, a production of <b><i><a href=\"/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</a> </i></b>(Florante and Laura).

Here the widely traveled polyglot and cosmopolitan doctor Rizal adapts to the rural life of his open prison in the last years of his life. Rizal befriends Captain Carnicero, the colonial authority in Dapitan; rebuffs the efforts of Father Sanchez to win him back to the Catholic Church; and resists the machinations of Father Obach to make him renounce his heretical beliefs. In spite of Father Obach&rsquo;s efforts to ostracize him and scare the townspeople away from having relations with a heretic under pain of damnation, Rizal begins to affect the whole town for the better. He creates a water-supply system and establishes a makeshift hospital that services even the poorest folks of Dapitan. The film details Rizal&rsquo;s life as a teacher in the school that he founded, innovatively instructing his students in the languages and arithmetic, as well as in athletics and the arts, and imparting the value of courage. The film also tells the stormy love story of Rizal and Josephine Bracken, the Eurasian stepdaughter of Rizal&rsquo;s patient, George Taufer. It shows their life together as common-law husband and wife. The film ends with Rizal leaving Bracken and Dapitan to be a doctor in Cuba. The townspeople gather on the shore, mourning as they bid him farewell.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:.2pt\">In the 1998 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4436\">Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences</a> Awards, <b><i>Rizal sa Dapitan</i></b> won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Story, and Best Production Design, as well as the Centennial Award.

Here the widely traveled polyglot and cosmopolitan doctor Rizal adapts to the rural life of his open prison in the last years of his life. Rizal befriends Captain Carnicero, the colonial authority in Dapitan; rebuffs the efforts of Father Sanchez to win him back to the Catholic Church; and resists the machinations of Father Obach to make him renounce his heretical beliefs. In spite of Father Obach&#x2019;s efforts to ostracize him and scare the townspeople away from having relations with a heretic under pain of damnation, Rizal begins to affect the whole town for the better. He creates a water-supply system and establishes a makeshift hospital that services even the poorest folks of Dapitan. The film details Rizal&#x2019;s life as a teacher in the school that he founded, innovatively instructing his students in the languages and arithmetic, as well as in athletics and the arts, and imparting the value of courage. The film also tells the stormy love story of Rizal and Josephine Bracken, the Eurasian stepdaughter of Rizal&#x2019;s patient, George Taufer. It shows their life together as common-law husband and wife. The film ends with Rizal leaving Bracken and Dapitan to be a doctor in Cuba. The townspeople gather on the shore, mourning as they bid him farewell.</span>"

The reason for the crime is deceptively simple: she stabbed him because he became too amorous in his advances, and she is a married woman.

According to her, Jimmy forced his way into her hut while her husband was away. On the other hand, the people in the fishing village refuse to believe Salome whom they view as a seductress. One woman accuses Salome of luring one of her sons to his death, and believes that what happened to her son must also have happened to Jimmy. Kario&rsquo;s version contradicts the first two versions. He claims that he caught Salome and Jimmy committing adultery and in anger forced her to kill her lover. The film ends with Kario and Salome leaving the village to start life anew. At the beach, Salome looks sadly at the sea. Kario embraces her from the back, as though protecting her from the wind. Slowly he draws his knife and drives it into Salome&rsquo;s back.

Rex looks up to Homer, and Homer is careful to be upright and worthy of his son&rsquo;s admiration. But Homer has a temper and is given to drunkenness, which proves to be a fatal combination. One morning, while nursing a hangover, Homer allows his irritation to cloud his judgment. He shoots a boy whom he suspects is a thief, but who is only trying to retrieve a kite from the rooftop. He then attempts a series of cover-ups, even as he is hounded by guilt. Unbeknownst to Homer, Rex is a witness to the crime, and the boy is weighed down by guilt.

Rex looks up to Homer, and Homer is careful to be upright and worthy of his son&#x2019;s admiration. But Homer has a temper and is given to drunkenness, which proves to be a fatal combination. One morning, while nursing a hangover, Homer allows his irritation to cloud his judgment. He shoots a boy whom he suspects is a thief, but who is only trying to retrieve a kite from the rooftop. He then attempts a series of cover-ups, even as he is hounded by guilt. Unbeknownst to Homer, Rex is a witness to the crime, and the boy is weighed down by guilt.

His success as an actor brings him in contact with the rich and famous, whom he soon finds out are also predatory and morally bankrupt. As the actor becomes part of this tinsel world, he realizes that he must distance himself from his mother who is dying to crash into that world. Because she is a simple illiterate woman, the son is afraid that any link with her would expose his humble background.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.1pt\">The other son is the opposite of his brother. An ordinary worker with a mature outlook, Emong cheerfully accepts himself, even if his mother does not believe in him. He is diligent and hardworking.

Soon, Mersila bears Bangas-an&#x2019;s child, with Shaleha performing her role as midwife, not knowing that Mersila had already convinced Bangas-an to separate from Shaleha."

When Caloy&rsquo;s pedicab is repossessed, Caloy has no choice but to turn to pickpocketing, a crime that Rex has mastered. Rex, on the other hand, if not taking care of his baby boy with his wife Tess, spends most afternoons doing drugs with his friends. Separately, the boys turn to shoplifting, conning unsuspecting pedestrians, and doing other fraudulent activities.

Rex, on the other hand, if not taking care of his baby boy with his wife Tess, spends most afternoons doing drugs with his friends.

One day, Nyor&rsquo;s daughter Amor comes home ill after spending time in another town to work. The town physician tells Nyor that Amor is suffering from a stomach infection and prescribes antibiotics. Amor&rsquo;s illness persists and one evening she jumps out of her bedroom window, then wanders into the woods where she attacks and kills two barangay officials patrolling the community. Amor later returns to her family. Upon seeing her all bloodied up, Nyor chains her to the bed to keep her from harming other people.

Apparently, Amor&rsquo;s condition has taken a turn for the worse; she is now an aswang and will start killing people. Unable to bear the pain his daughter is going through, Nyor frees Amor from her chains and asks her to do what she must, but to spare her family in the process. Amor starts killing several people, prompting Nyor&rsquo;s friend Dolpo, the town official, to scour the community for possible suspects. Dolpo unsuspectingly shoots a creature in the dark and as he, his officials, and Nyor track down the creature, Dolpo realizes that the creature he shot is his goddaughter Amor. Fearful that Dolpo will further hurt his daughter, Nyor kills Dolpo and brings the wounded Amor back home. As Nyor tries to stop Amor&rsquo;s bleeding, she escapes, but not before taking her own nephew from the crib. Upon seeing Amor eating his grandchild, Nyor accuses her of being a monster.
