He was born in&nbsp;Quiapo, Manila on 8 Feb 1886. He died in 1955. He married Rosa Sevilla, writer and founder of the Instituto de Mujeres. Among the couple&rsquo;s children was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5036\">Aurelio Alvero</a>, a poet and renowned art collector who wrote his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2122\">art criticism</a> under the nom de plume &ldquo;Magtanggol Asa.&rdquo; Emilio Alvero finished his basic education at the Quiapo Parochial School.

Alvero&rsquo;s <b><i>Table Delicacies</i></b>, 1928, is outstanding not only because of the realism of the dish of tuna, the cantaloupe, and the basket of vegetables in the background, but also because the composition consists of mostly oval shapes which are echoed in the oval shape of the painting itself and the concave glass cover of the painting.

		"text": "<p><strong>Pablo Antonio </strong>(<strong>Pablo Sebero Antonio</strong>) was an architect. He&nbsp;is a National Artist for architecture. He was born in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/415\">Binondo</a>, Manila on 25 Jan 1902. He died on 14 Jun 1975. His father, Apolonio Antonio, was a <strong>maestro de obras</strong> (master builder) who dabbled in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>; his mother, Trinidad Sebero, died when he was very young. He and his wife Marina have two sons, Ramon and Luis, who are architects and interior designers. Antonio worked as a draftsman for the Bureau of Public Works while attending high school at night. After taking a correspondence course in architecture and structural engineering, he took formal courses in architecture at Mapua Institute of Technology but soon dropped out due to the pressure of work. Antonio resigned from the bureau and worked as a draftsman and construction foreman for the Mapua Arevalo Siochi Construction Company, later called the Santa Clara Construction Co. In 1927, one of the company&rsquo;s owners sent Antonio on a scholarship to the University of London where he finished the five-year architectural course in three years. He returned to Manila, passed the government examinations, and became a registered architect in 1932. Widespread recognition of his gifts led to his appointment as architect of various institutions and corporations, among them Far Eastern University (FEU), Philippine National Bank, and Manila Railroad Co.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1933, he completed his first major work, the Ideal Theater on Rizal Ave, Manila. He subsequently designed the FEU Building on Quezon Blvd, the Boulevard-Alhambra (now Bel-Air) Apartments on Dewey (now Roxas) Blvd, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5618\">Ramon Roces Publications</a> Building, and the White Cross Preventorium. Antonio&rsquo;s works after World War II include the Manila Polo Club, the Capitan Luis Gonzaga Building on Rizal Ave and Carriedo, the FEU Administration and Science Buildings, and the Galaxy Theater on Rizal Ave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonio&rsquo;s buildings represented a new direction in Philippine architecture. They were characterized by clean lines, plain surfaces, and bold rectangular masses&mdash;a striking departure from the traditionalist and academic style prevailing at the time. Moreover, Antonio regarded every design project as unique and imparted to every building he created a distinctive form and character, avoiding anything that might be seen as a trademark. He used wood, stone, and reinforced concrete to create refinement, warmth, and virility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the FEU Building combines formal symmetry with a robust sturdiness, the Ramon Roces Publications Building is irregular in plan, asymmetrical in its facade, and characterized by movement and diverse forms. Like many architects of his time, Antonio used the sunbreak, but departed from the general pattern. In the Capitan Luis Gonzaga Building, horizontal slabs project from ceiling and windowsill height, while vertical fins of half-story height are staggered, creating a contrast between continuous horizontal planes, and broken vertical planes. Antonio considered the Manila Polo Club one of his best works. The sprawling building, sheltered by hip roofs and using wood and stone with great visual impact, is both festive and virile in character. The woodwork on the ceiling of the social lounge is like a huge abstract sculpture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonio was a member of the Board of Examiners for Architects, 1936-37, president of the Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA), 1941-44, and member of the Quezon City Capitol Site on City Planning, 1946-47. He was named Architect of the Year by PIA in 1952 and given the National Award of Merit for Architecture in 1954 by the Philippine Republic. In 1956, he was listed in Asia&rsquo;s <strong><em>Who&rsquo;s Who</em></strong>, a Hong Kong publication. In 1971, he received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. In 1972, he was conferred the Republic Cultural Heritage Award. In 1976, he was posthumously named National Artist for architecture. A book titled <strong><em>The Architectural Legacy of Pablo S.

When he was 12, his father died and his elder brother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2632\">Arcadio</a>, an architect, took care of him and his schooling. As a boy, he studied <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\">Lorenzo Guerrero</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a> and took lessons in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>. In 1906, he studied architecture at the Drexel Institute in Philadelphia. After traveling through Europe, he did postgraduate work in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania and attended the Beaux Arts School in New York. When he returned to the Philippines, he worked with his brother Arcadio on such projects as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/305\">Gota de Leche Building</a> on Lepanto St and the old Casino Espa&ntilde;ol on Taft Ave. He became assistant architect, then supervising architect, and finally consulting architect for the Bureau of Public Works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arellano influenced the development of Filipino architecture in his time, not only in its neoclassic phase but also the art deco and later nativist phases. Like many architects trained in the United States in the early 20th century, he came under the influence of the Paris Ecole des Beaux Arts and promoted the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassic</a> style. This can be seen in his major works, which include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a> (presently the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a> main office and Museum of Fine Arts), completed in 1926; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Post Office Building</a>, 1931; and the Villamor Hall at the University of the Philippines (UP) campus on Taft Ave. In contrast, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> , 1931, combines <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> and local forms, such as bamboo stalks and mangoes. These four buildings were destroyed during World War II and rebuilt according to the original plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1930s, Arellano designed government buildings for Banaue, Ifugao, and Glan, Cotabato, making use of local architectural forms.

In 1832, he was assigned to Pandacan as parish priest, then to Nagcarlan in 1834. He was elected as a representative of the ruling body of the Franciscan order in 1849 and 1870.

He died in&nbsp;Cebu on 30 Apr 1851. The son of Matias and Manuela Bermejo, Julian entered the Augustinian novitiate at age 15. He pronounced his vows in the order in 1793, left Cadiz with 20 other Augustinians in 1796, and arrived in Manila most likely on 11 Mar 1797. His first assignment was as parish priest of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/272\">Boljoon</a>, succeeding Fr Manuel Cordero on 19 Oct 1802. Promotion to higher offices in the order followed: prior of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/380\">Cebu Convent of Santo Ni&ntilde;o</a> in 1825, president of the chapter of 1829, prior of Bacolor, Pampanga, in 1833, and provincial in 1837-39. But it is as builder and military commander that Bermejo is better known.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Arriving in Boljoon, Bermejo found the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/272\">church</a> still unfinished, a replacement for an earlier church destroyed by slave raiders in 1782. He completed the church but judged the palisade surrounding the church inadequate. So he surrounded the church complex with a stone wall and a bulwark or strong house, facing the sea. From then on, he initiated the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortification</a> of other churches in southern Cebu and devised a system of communication called&nbsp;<em>telegrafo</em>, based on a network of watchtowers and signal flags and flares, bells and drums. The linchpin of his system was a tower on the hill immediately north of the Boljoon complex. When Bermejo was done, he had constructed a string of towers along the shores of southern Cebu from Carcar to Ta&ntilde;on, later Santander.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He organized militias consisting of sentinels, who manned the towers day and night and watched the seas with their telescopes ready to warn the townspeople of an impending raiding party. He also prepared seaborne fleets ready to repel the raiders and a volunteer army for land defense. So effective was Bermejo that after a sea battle in 1815 off Sumilon Island, offshore between Oslob and Santander, no raiders attacked southern Cebu thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1827, Bermejo joined an expedition to Bohol, under Cebu&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>alcalde mayor&nbsp;</em>(governor) Don Jose Lazaro Cairo, to reintegrate the remnants of Dagohoy&rsquo;s rebel camps to lowland society. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p><strong>Daniel Burnham</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Daniel Hudson Burnham</strong>) was an architect and city planner. He was born in Henderson, New York, USA on 4 Sep 1846. He died in&nbsp;Heidelberg, Germany on 1 Jun 1912. He was educated in Chicago and Waltman, Massachusetts, where he graduated from high school. Failing admissions tests to Harvard and Yale, and leaving an aborted political career, he worked as a draftsman for the architectural firm of William Le Baron Jenney. From there he apprenticed with the Chicago firm Carter, Drake and Wright. There he met John Wellborn Root, 1850-91, and in 1873 their partnership began, eventually developing into a leading architectural firm. Burnham &amp; Root emphasized steel-frame construction, which made the skyscraper possible. Their complementary personalities suited this partnership. Root was quiet, weak at people skills but had a sharp mechanical mind. He was well-versed in physics and an astute draftsman. Burnham was good at dealing with people and he dreamt big. A much quoted saying of his was: &ldquo;Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men&rsquo;s blood.&rdquo; The firm designed many landmark buildings in Chicago, New York, Washington DC, and London. Work on the Columbian Exposition or Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair, 1893, and his designs for Washington DC, Cleveland, San Francisco, and Chicago established Burnham&rsquo;s reputation as a city planner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Columbian Exposition, where he worked closely with landscape architect Fredrick Law Olmstead, and where other architects were commissioned to design buildings concretized Burnham&rsquo;s vision of the &ldquo;City Beautiful,&rdquo; which followed French Beaux Arts design principles that favored <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neoclassical</a> architecture, characterized by symmetry, balance, and splendor. The area chosen for the exposition was a 630-acre property on Jackson Park. This largely undeveloped land gave Burnham the blank canvas on which to build his vision of well-planned city come true. The Columbian Exposition was called the &ldquo;White City&rdquo; because its building were finished in white stucco and illuminated by electrical lights at night. The Columbian exposition would mark Burnham&rsquo;s other works and city plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As president of the American Institute of Architects in 1894, he established close friendships with high government officials, including Pres Theodore Roosevelt. He recommended a young friend ambitious for a foreign assignment, William Cameron Forbes, whom Roosevelt appointed to the Philippines in 1904.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forbes sought to improve infrastructure in the Philippines and listened to William Howard Taft, then secretary of war, who suggested that a landscape architect help design <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/414\">Baguio</a>, &ldquo;a new city 5,000 feet above the sea, which will be to the Philippines what Simla is to India&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2665\">Klassen</a> 1987, 187). Consulted by Forbes, Burnham volunteered to go; he stayed in the Philippines for about six weeks in 1904. He proposed a grand plan for Manila involving a gridiron street pattern with diagonal thoroughfares converging at rotundas of various sizes to connect the outlying towns and districts bordering Manila. He planned for plenty of open spaces, greenery, and fountains. Government buildings would be the focus of the city, and he chose the sites for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army and Navy Club</a>, Philippine General Hospital, and apparently the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/337\">Post Office</a>.

		"text": "<p><strong>Ed Calma</strong> (<strong>Eduardo Gongon Calma</strong>) is an architect and interior designer. He was&nbsp;born in&nbsp;Manila on 13 Oct 1963. He is the son of architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2642\">Lor Calma</a> and Estella Gongon. One of his five siblings is also an architect. He studied at Pratt Institute, New York, from 1983 to 1988 where he obtained a bachelor of arts in architecture. He spent the year 1985 in Rome under Pratt International Studies conjointly with the University of Rome, Italy. He went on further studies from 1993 to 1994 at Columbia University, New York, where he obtained a master&rsquo;s degree in advanced architectural design. In between his studies, he worked for the architectural firm of Carlos Zapata and Peter Pran.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Pratt, Calma&rsquo;s mentors encouraged him to look for sources of inspiration outside architecture and create new definitions of space. Returning to the Philippines in 1997, he worked with his father&rsquo;s architectural firm, Lor Calma and Associates, which not only designed buildings but also built furniture and through Lor founded the Philippine School of Interior Design. Ed has since become design principal, architect, and interior designer of the company. Like his father, Ed is committed to modernism but his works break away from the modernist mold by drawing inspiration not from the box, which characterized early modernism in the Philippines, but from nature and from letting space and location influence the design. The term &ldquo;postmodern&rdquo; might be aptly applied to his designs. While Lor&rsquo;s works used local material, Ed&rsquo;s works use new materials like structural glass and metal, and stones like travertine and onyx, which are increasingly available because of the global market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ed&rsquo;s two iconic buildings are the De La Salle University&ndash;College of Saint Benilde&rsquo;s School of Design and Arts (CSB-SDA), established in 1995, and the Mind Museum, completed in 2011. Both buildings are designed from inside out&mdash;that is, the interior spaces defined what the skin or exterior looks like. The 14-story CSB-SDA has the theater jutting out of the facade to serve as canopy for the lower floor. The facade is not a straight line but is angled, with the center pushing forward. The interior is whitewashed and sheeted in glass, which allows light in and opens to a view of the surroundings. The Mind Museum is described as &ldquo;amorphic&rdquo; or formless. It has no clear facade. As an organic form with multiple entrances, it can be viewed from anywhere. The cell was the inspiration for a building. Its design was allowed to evolve through interaction with the site and the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ed Calma Architecture, the professional name of the company Ed runs, has been involved in many projects, some of which have been built while others have yet to be realized. The projects include resorts like Bantayan Resort, Lio Resort, Samal Island Hotel; infrastructures like Serendra Bridge, Lighthouse; office buildings like CLIPP Center, MDI Building, Landco Pacific Building; residential design; interior design like the Mind Museum, De Gallego Apartment; commercial/retail design like Z Bar, Univers, R12; education architecture like DLSU CSB-SDA and Henry Sy Innovation Center; museum and exhibitions like Expo Japan 2005, Expo Hannover 2000, Expo Zaragosa 2008; and master plans like those for Liberty, Azotea, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ed&rsquo;s works have been featured in a number of books&mdash;namely, <strong><em>Peter Pran of Ellerbe Becket: Recent Works</em></strong>, 1991; Raul A.

His parents are Gregorio Calma and Felisa Licad. His wife is Estella Gongon; they have five children, two of whom are architects. He holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in architecture from Mapua Institute of Technology, 1954. Since 1956 he has been engaged in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/215\">interior design</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> design and manufacturing, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/254\">architectural design</a>. He heads the firm Lor L. Calma Designs Associates Inc. Calma is founding member and past president of the Philippine Institute of Interior Designers. He was a member of the first specialty board for interior designers of the Professional Regulation Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calma&rsquo;s projects include the interiors of banks, offices, hotels, restaurants, clubhouses, resorts, and residences. He designed and executed the interiors of the Development Bank of the Philippines, Buendia, Makati; Philippine National Bank, Escolta, Manila; Development Academy of the Philippines, Tagaytay City; Silahis Hotel, Roxas Blvd, Manila; Midtown Ramada Hotel, Pedro Gil, Manila; Puerto Azul Hotel and Beach Resort, Ternate, Cavite; and Benguet Center, Mandaluyong, Metro Manila. His style is modern, inspired by the Bauhaus style, using chromium, glass, and leather. In the 1980s, he went into the postmodern style, which tends toward revivalist and romantic motifs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Partnering with his son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2641\">Ed</a>, Calma&rsquo;s architectural firm has pushed the boundaries of design with deconstructed architecture pieces like the DLSU&ndash;Saint Benilde&rsquo;s School of Art and Design on Singalong St and the Mind Museum at the Fort in Bonifacio Global City. These works are designed inside out, with the exterior hinting at what may lie within. For Saint Benilde&rsquo;s, Calma designed the theater as a structure that juts beyond the facade and serves as a canopy for the lower floor. The Mind Museum is more organic. In 2009, his exhibit titled <strong><em>Architect</em></strong> <em><strong>Lor Calma: Paintings and Sculptures</strong> </em>was held at the Ayala Museum, Greenbelt Art Park, Makati. His sculpture <strong><em>Transformation</em></strong> combines three forms of stacked laminated glass, 5-10 m tall, that represent Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

		"text": "<p>The<strong> CBCP Episcopal Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church</strong> (<strong>ECCHC</strong>),&nbsp;formerly known as the Permanent Committee for the Cultural Heritage of the Church (PCCHC), was established by the Catholic Bishops&rsquo; Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) during its 73rd general assembly on 8 Jul 1996 (CBCP 1996). One of the 30 or so working bodies serving the permanent assembly of the Philippine Catholic episcopacy and the individual bishops in their respective sees, the PCCHC was under the Department of Doctrine and Religious Affairs for purposes of administration and coordination (CBCP 2000).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, the CBCP Episcopal Commission on Culture issued a mandate to address emerging issues and concerns related to the pastoral care of the Church&rsquo;s tangible cultural heritage. This concern came to a focus when CBCP created the PCCHC, inspired by the establishment by Pope John Paul II in 1988 of the Pontifical Commission for Preserving the Artistic and Historic Patrimony of the Church attached to the Congregation for the Clergy, a department in the Roman Curia (John Paul II 1988). The pope later renamed it as the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church and made it an autonomous department with its own president and staff, maintaining periodic contact with the Pontifical Council for Culture (John Paul II 1993). PCCHC became a consultative body and an independent working entity within the CBCP with its own chairperson (always a bishop) and an executive secretary (a priest). It is internally organized with an executive board of four bishop-members and an advisory board of appointed lay experts drawn from the multidisciplinary sciences of cultural heritage studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The PCCHC&rsquo;s defined mandate is to preside over the guardianship of the historical and artistic patrimony of the local church in the Philippines. It exercises this mandate by promoting the ecclesiastical cultural heritage as an invaluable aid to evangelization and catechesis, fomenting research on and understanding of the ecclesiastical cultural properties, initiating and sustaining collaboration between the CBCP and parallel government agencies and nongovernment institutions involved in the care, conservation, and appreciation of the ecclesiastical cultural patrimony, and undertaking projects in different ecclesiastical territories in the country upon invitation or authorization of and collaboration with the diocesan bishops concerned (CBCP 2000). PCCHC also liaises with the Holy See&rsquo;s Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church (Benedict XVI 2000) to assure &ldquo;a harmonization of objectives and fruitful and reciprocal collaboration&rdquo; (John Paul II 1993).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The presence of PCCHC as an institutional legation of the CBCP in the National Committee on Monuments and Sites of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts</a> led to the preparation and realization of the Holy See&ndash;Republic of the Philippines Agreement on the Cultural Heritage of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, an international accord entered into by the Vatican and the Philippines in 2007, and made effective the following year by which the two sovereign entities commit to cooperate for the conservation of identified tangible cultural heritage resources of the Church in the Philippines (Papal Secretariat 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the Permanent Committee&rsquo;s enduring activities is its biennial National Convention of Church Cultural Heritage Practitioners first held in the Diocese of Tagbilaran, Bohol, in 1999. Serving as a venue for continuing education in this specialized pastoral field, the said convention gathers all administrators, curators, and workers of church heritage all over the Philippine Catholic Church once every two years. Proceedings of the biennial national conventions are published in <strong><em>Pintacasi</em></strong>, the annual journal devoted to the study of the cultural heritage of the Catholic Church in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the projects completed by the PCCHC is the writing of a handbook for the proper documentation of church property and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">restoration</a> of heritage buildings following the methods of construction appropriate to the building and its construction. The PCCHC has been active in collaborating with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2683\"> National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP)</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a> in documenting and restoring church-related buildings. With NHCP assistance, it worked on the restoration of the Balilihan watchtower / bell tower in Bohol. When a number of the churches listed by the National Museum as national cultural treasures were damaged by the earthquake of Oct 2013 and by typhoon Yolanda in Nov of the same year, the PCCHC worked with the appropriate government agencies to protect the damaged properties and through the parishes gathered volunteers to help in the recovery, sorting, and documentation of pieces of the damaged churches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of problems may be considered obstacles to the proper preservation and protection of church heritage. For one, the legal owner of church property in the Philippines is the territorial bishop. Therefore, the PCCHC, being a national body, does not have absolute control over any church property. A bishop can decide against all objections to do what he thinks best. This has happened in many places where the bishop, through the parish priest, authorized the construction of new buildings that marred the original layout of a colonial-period church. In some cases, the timely intervention of heritage and civic groups and exposure to media, more than the PCCHC, succeeded in stopping such ill-advised initiatives. Moreover, some parish priests have also been instrumental in defacing heritage structures for lack of knowledge about the value of heritage structures. Ironically, some have even resorted to selling church artifacts to raise funds for the maintenance of their heritage sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The full protection of such heritage structures faces multiple difficulties and requires multiple solutions. Among these are lack of funds for the maintenance of heritage structures and the lack of formal training or ongoing professional education in matters of culture, art, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">heritage conservation</a> among the clergy. Furthermore, the handbook on documentation and conservation of PCCHC is not well known. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Mil&aacute;n Ted D.

After working with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2646\">Cesar Concio</a>, he set up his own firm. He is a member of the Philippine Institute of Architects and the American Institute of Architects. His early projects were mostly residences. Since the 1970s he has produced 16 high-rise buildings, ranging in height from 14 to 32 stories. His works include office buildings, apartment buildings and condominiums, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">school buildings</a>, hotels, sports and country clubs, beach resorts, malls, and factories.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bio1stparagtext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>Cultural Center of the Philippines</b>&nbsp;(<strong>CCP</strong>) is the leading institution in the country that plans and implements programs for the development and promotion of the arts&mdash;music, dance, theater, visual, literary, cinematic, and broadcast arts. Since 1969 when it was created by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos, it has sponsored programs and activities such as festivals, exhibitions, competitions, and publications to preserve, promote, and enhance the artistic and cultural heritage of the Filipino people, and to develop audiences that will appreciate and support artistic and cultural work. It is home to nine resident companies that present regular seasons of productions, workshops, and outreach performances: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2406\"> Ballet Philippines</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2412\">Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2554\">Philippine Ballet Theatre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4122\">Philippine Madrigal Singers</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>, and UST Symphony Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sitting on a 60-hectare complex on Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City, the CCP is part of a vast international network of arts and culture organizations that provide exchange opportunities between Filipino artists and artists from all over the world. This network also brings in performances and exhibitions that allow local audiences to experience arts and cultures from elsewhere. These organizations include the Association of Asia Pacific Performing Arts Center, the Conseil International des Organisations de Festivals de Folklore et d&rsquo;Arts Traditionnels, the World Dance Alliance, the International Theater Institute, the Asian Theater Alliance, the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, and the ASEAN&ndash;Korea Traditional Music Orchestra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is composed of several departments that promote arts education, direct outreach and exchange programs all over the country, mount productions and exhibitions, manage cultural holdings, and develop its assets. In its first two decades the CCP focused on what were later perceived as elitist performing arts&mdash;theater, ballet, opera, and similar shows&mdash;a bias that was shaped by its first board of trustees chair, then First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos. Following the successful EDSA revolt against Marcos and his martial rule and the subsequent change in the country&rsquo;s leadership, the CCP expanded its scope to include literature, film, and broadcast arts, among others. It also reoriented its direction to emphasize original Filipino artistic and cultural expressions rooted in the Philippines and the participation of the regions in the definition of a national culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Music. </b>The CCP is home to the country&rsquo;s premier symphonic orchestra, the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra (PPO). Established in 1973, the PPO (then known as the CCP Philharmonic Orchestra) initially accompanied local and foreign performing artists at the CCP. It later evolved as one of the best music ensembles in the Asia-Pacific region, premiering works by Filipino and foreign composers, and promoting music appreciation throughout the country. Past conductors and musical directors of the PPO include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4212\">Luis Valencia</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4234\">Oscar Yatco</a>, Ruggero Barbieri, Olivier Ochanine, and Yoshikazu Fukumura.Among the internationally renowned conductors who have performed with the PPO are Mendi Rodan, Piero Gamba, Enrique Batis, Sebastian Bereau, and Nicholas Koch. Some of the world&rsquo;s best Filipino and foreign artists have also performed with the PPO, including Van Cliburn, Renata Tebaldi, Judith Engel, Anthony Camden, David Benoit, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4043\">Cecile Licad</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4186\">Raul Sunico</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3232\"> Lea Salonga</a>. The PPO is now on its 34th concert season. It has toured in Europe, Asia, and more recently, the United States, when it performed for the first time at the Carnegie Hall. Aside from its regular concert seasons at the CCP, the PPO also participates in the CCP Outreach Program by performing in public spaces and conducting workshops in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another resident company of the CCP is the Philippine Madrigal Singers. Organized in 1963 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4222\">Andrea O. Veneracion</a>, later National Artist for music, the choir is composed of students, teachers, and alumni from the various colleges of the University of the Philippines. Performing a wide repertoire of various styles and forms, the ensemble has consistently won all the top prizes in most of the world&rsquo;s prestigious choral competitions. The choir also maintains an active outreach and concert schedule every year and is regarded as one of the country&rsquo;s most active ambassadors of goodwill and one of the world&rsquo;s most traveled choirs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The UST Symphony Orchestra is also a resident performing group of the CCP. It holds regular concerts at the CCP and participates in the CCP Outreach and Exchange Program. It also serves as a pool for additional players as the needs of the PPO dictate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1987, the CCP launched the <b><i>Filipino Artists Series</i></b> (FAS), a monthly program featuring solo performances of acclaimed and emerging Filipino musical artists. Among those featured in the FAS were bass baritone Jonathan Zaens; flutist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4057\">Antonio Maigue</a>; cellist Wilfredo Pasamba; pianists Corazon Kabayao, Mariel Illusorio, Peter Porticos, and Rene Dalandan; violinists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4026\"> Gilopez Kabayao</a>, Gina Medina, and Denise Huang; and sopranos Clarissa Ocampo and Maria Cristina Viguilla-Navarro. FAS was discontinued in 2009 but was later revived in 2012 as the <b><i>Special Concert Series</i></b>. Some of the performing artists in this series are pianist Charisse Baldoria, soprano Katrina Saporsantos, cellist Antoni Josef Inacay, trumpet player Raymond de Leon, percussionist Aimee Mina dela Cruz, and flutist Sarah Mae Gabuyo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP also embarked on the production of Filipino operas as well as Western operas that were adapted to a Philippine setting. In 1970, it partnered with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4091\">Music Promotion Foundation of the Philippines</a> in producing <b><i><strong> <strong>El Filibusterismo</strong> </strong> </i></b> (Subversion), the operatic adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5652\"> Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\">novel</a>, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3965\">Felipe Padilla de Leon</a> and libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>. De Leon and Tolentino&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><b><i><strong> <strong><strong> <strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong> </strong> </strong> </strong> </i></b> </a>(Touch Me Not), first staged at the FEU Auditorium in 1957, was also restaged at the CCP in 1974, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3956\"> Don David </a> as Ibarra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4158\">Ruby Salazar</a> as Maria Clara, Jimmy Melendres as Padre Damaso, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3953\">Fides Cuyugan-Asensio</a> as Sisa. In 1984, the CCP and Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines commissioned <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3980\">Francisco Feliciano</a> to create the three-act opera <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a></i></b> (The Black She-wolf), with libretto by Cuyugan-Asensio. In 1987, the CCP partnered with Music Theater Foundation in another restaging of <b><i>Noli&hellip;</i></b> this time with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3920\">Nolyn Cabahug</a> as Ibarra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3982\">Andion Fernandez</a> as Maria Clara, and Cuyugan-Asensio as Sisa (alternating with Luz Morete). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>&rsquo;s Philippine adaptation of <b><i>La Traviata</i></b> and <b><i>La Boheme</i></b> were also produced by and staged at the CCP in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Two major opera productions of the CCP in the 21st century were <b><i><strong> <strong>Spoliarium</strong> </strong> </i></b>, 2003, and <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b>, 2012. <b><i>Spoliarium</i></b> was inspired by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> &rsquo;s life and masterpiece, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a> and libretto by Fides Cuyugan-Asensio, and co-produced by the CCP with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4106\">Opera Guild of the Philippines</a><b>&nbsp;</b>and Music Theater Foundation of the Philippines. <b><i>Madame Butterfly</i></b> was a co-production of the CCP and MusicArtes, Inc, with director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3017\">Anton Juan</a> giving local flavor to Puccini&rsquo;s famous opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP is also the organizer and main proponent of major music festivals including the biennial Andrea Veneracion International Choral Festival and the CCP International Jazz Festival which was merged with the Orchestra and Symphonic Band Festival, and the annual Flute/Woodwind Festival. It has also been actively supporting the National Music Competitions for Young Artists (NAMCYA) since its inception in 1973. The CCP Arts Education Department also organizes masterclasses of renowned musical artists as well as yearly workshops in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/36/803\"><b>rondalla</b> </a>music, choral music, and band music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Dance. </b>The CCP has four resident dance companies: Ballet Philippines (BP), which is based at the CCP Main Building, and Philippine Ballet Theatre (PBT), Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company, and the Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group (ROFC) which are all based outside the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since its founding in 1969, BP has performed over 400 works at the CCP, ranging from full-length classical ballets to modern dance and neo-ethnic pieces, under its founding artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2565\">Alice Reyes</a>, later National Artist for Dance, and after her, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2593\"> Cecile Sicangco</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2499\"> Noordin Jumalon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2520\">Alden Lugnasin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2437\">Augustus Damian III</a>, Alan Hineline, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2521\">Max Luna III</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2541\"> Paul Morales</a>.

Gawad Alternatibo annually cites the best efforts of Pinoy filmmakers in four categories: Animation, Experimental, Documentary, and Short Feature. Each winner receives a cash prize and a certificate. Special citations are also awarded to the best work from the regions, as well as works on/for/by children. Many of today&rsquo;s outstanding filmmakers and media practitioners are awardees of Gawad Alternatibo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4336\">Cinemalaya Philippine Independent Film Festival</a> is one of the CCP&rsquo;s most important cinema-related undertakings every year. Established in 2004, the festival has given birth to some of Philippine cinema&rsquo;s contemporary masterpieces and is regarded as one of the most prestigious independent film competitions in the country, and a much awaited cultural event as well. Some of today&rsquo;s acclaimed filmmakers have launched their careers via the annual festival and competition, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Kanakan Balintagos</a> aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Aureaus Solito</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4428\">Lawrence Fajardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4539\">Chris Martinez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4498\">Jun Robles Lana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5792\">Alvin B.

In recognition of the broad reach and powerful influence of radio and television, the CCP established in 1987 a Coordinating Center for Broadcast Arts which was one of the units of the then Visual, Literary, and Media Arts Department. While all these units have been replaced by the Media Arts Division, the CCP&mdash;then and now&mdash;has continued efforts to equip ordinary citizens with the skills to produce radio programs and videos that reflect their realities and that allow them to promote their sectoral interests through broadcasting. It conducts hands-on training-workshops on radio and television production and scriptwriting, accepts apprenticeships, and awards production grants. While bringing its training program to as far north as Batanes and as far south as Tawi-tawi, the CCP encourages the use of Filipino languages in the programs and videos produced by its trainees. Among those who complete the training programs and are given grants to produce their own radio programs are farmers, fisherfolk, social development and cultural workers, students, and local leaders who produce and host talk shows, historical documentaries, instructional programs, public service announcements, music shows, and dramatizations of Filipino myths and legends. Their productions are aired in cooperation with local radio stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP produces television programs as well as videos. In 1990 it produced <b><i>Pinoy Eh</i></b>, a magazine show<b><i> </i></b>aired on ABC Channel 5.

Among CCP&rsquo;s current radio programs is the weekly <b><i>Culture Carousel</i></b>, which has been airing on DZFE since 1990. It features CCP music artists as well as visiting music artists and airs their performances.

The first essays on the seven arts were compiled and published in a coffee table book with the same title in 1991. To encourage the staging of more sarsuwela, the CCP came out with the sarsuwela series which made available to scholars and performing groups the scripts and music of the classic Tagalog sarsuwela <b><i><a href=\"/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a> </i></b>(After the Darkness),<i> <b><a href=\"/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></b> </i>(Country Maiden), and <b><i><a href=\"/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a> </i></b>(No Wounds) as performed and staged by Tanghalang Pilipino. The initial publication in 1991 included the cassette tapes and books for <b><i>Paglipas ng Dilim</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b>, and in 1994, for <b><i>Walang Sugat</i></b>.<i> </i>The videotaped performances of <b><i>Dalagang Bukid</i></b> and <b><i>Walang Sugat</i></b><i> </i>were released in DVD format in 2007.<i> </i>"

He died&nbsp;between 1719 and 1732. His parents were Juan de Ciscara Yba&ntilde;ez and Maria Candelaria Ramirez. The older De Ciscara was a military engineer who worked on the fortification of Havana in 1670. Juan followed in his father&rsquo;s footsteps. His career began as a soldier in Yucatan, Mexico, where he served for a year and three months. By 1692 he had moved to Havana, but despite an official recommendation he was unable to find employment as a military engineer. Back in Mexico, he was appointed assistant engineer under Jaime Franck in 1694.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demonstrating great competence and enthusiasm, he was promoted to the rank of captain of the infantry in 1695. He was commissioned to examine and propose plans for the fortification of the Barlovento Islands. While his work won the approval of the viceroy, De Ciscara requested to retire from military service but was denied because of lack of military engineers. After years of service, he succeeded Franck in supervising the works on the fortification of Santa Maria de Galve. He was awarded honorary rank of&nbsp;<em>sargento mayor&nbsp;</em>(sergeant major). Another request for retirement in 1702 due to health was granted for a period of four months after which he was called to active service. In Dec 1704, he was assigned to supervise construction at Fort San Diego in Acapulco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following year he was in the Philippines, the first military engineer to be sent to the islands, which needed a professional very badly. In Oct 1705, he was busy planning the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/232\">fortifications</a> of Cavite. He returned to Mexico where in 1713 he replaced Juan Bautista Mazoni as chief engineer. He returned to the Philippines in Jul 1717, accompanied by two servants: Ignacio de la Cruz, a Filipino, and Juan de Irigoyen, a Navarrese. As soon as he arrived, he checked on the progress at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> and the walls. Very little is heard about him until a letter from Gov-Gen Fernando Valdes Tamon, addressed to the king and dated 4 Jul 1732, asked to send a military engineer, for there was no one in Manila. Presumably, De Ciscara had died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Ciscara worked on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/301\">Fort San Pedro</a> in Cebu and Fort Santiago in Manila and the rebuilding of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/296\">Fort Pilar</a>, whose plans he drew in 1719. He also worked on nonmilitary structures like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, the church of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia, the Seminario de San Clemente, and the <strong>convento</strong> (parish house) of San Juan de Dios de Manila, &ldquo;of which there remain only drawings&rdquo; (Luengo 2013). The Dominican provincial, Fr Pedro de Mejorada, asked him to design a chapel for Our Lady of the Rosary, which he provided without any monetary incentive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three drawings for the Philippines that De Ciscara made have survived: iconography of the Castle of Santiago, 1714, a proposal for the repair and rehabilitation of Fort Santiago; plan for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/286\">Cebu cathedral</a>, 1719; and a map of the Fort of Our Lady of Pilar<b> </b>in Zamboanga, 1719. The plan for the Cebu cathedral is unusual for its <strong>coro baxo</strong> or <strong>bajo</strong>, a choir stall in the middle of the nave, similar to those found in Mexico.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reconstruction of the Cebu cathedral was long delayed. Although royal approval was granted on 27 Oct 1670, the project did not progress much. With the arrival of a new bishop, Fr Miguel Bayot, the construction of the cathedral went on in earnest. Foundations were laid. But with the death of Bishop Bayot, not only was the cathedral left half done but a violent typhoon destroyed what had been built and the cathedral was left in ruins. The new bishop, Foronda, who took over the Diocese of Cebu in 1719, started a new project to build the cathedral. He sent the new plan made by De Ciscara to Manila. However, Manila considered the plan as too grand and more appropriate for a capital, and Cebu did not have the necessary expertise to work on the cathedral. By the time construction on the cathedral got under way in 1735, De Ciscara&rsquo;s plan was set aside. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p><strong>Juan de Uguccioni</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Giovanni Maria de Uguccioni</strong>) was a priest-architect. He was born in&nbsp;Florence ca 1704. He was active 1750-65. A native of Florence, Italy, he was a secular priest who belonged to the Cajetan or Theatine Order. He descended from the Uguccioni family who were influential in Florence since the 16th century. He most likely had an education in his hometown, where <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">classical</a> taste persisted while the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">baroque</a> was already flourishing in other Italian cities. After Florence, he went to Rome, where he may have come in contact with the baroque, although at this time there were no monumental baroque works being built yet. His architectural style, classicism with a mild touch of baroque, may be explained by his Florentine roots as modified by his Roman formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1709, the fathers of the Propaganda Fidei in Goa sent petitions to Rome asking for missionaries. All who arrived in Goa were Italians. He worked as a missionary in Bengkulu, Indonesia, where between 1709 and 1719 he assisted in building Fort York, later called Fort Marlborough, for the English. The fort did not last long because in 1719 the native population burnt it. He was in Goa by Jan 1723 where he remained until 1736. He used Goa as a base to travel elsewhere, like Borneo. While at Goa, he wrote a history of his order, <strong><em>Noticia das Missoes dos Clerigos Regulares na India Oriental</em></strong> (Report on the Missions of the Regular Clergy in East India). Architect Esteban de Rojas y Melo, who worked on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, affirms that De Uguccioni worked in Goa for three decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1750, while en route to Goa, De Uguccioni passed by the Philippines without the necessary license. He had been an engineer for the British on the coast of Malabar while serving as missionary of the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. His stay in the Philippines was brief and unplanned but was seen as providential, because an engineer was needed by the archbishop of Manila. Earlier, a committee assessing the ruinous state of the Manila Cathedral, which had undergone several typhoons and earthquakes, recommended that the structure be pulled down and one stronger and with better proportions be built. But there was no competent architect who could plan and supervise the rebuilding of the cathedral. Convened by Abp Juan Angel Rodriguez, OST, Abp 1731-42, the committee members who worked on the proposal for a new cathedral were Fr Joaquin Mezquita, SJ, said to be well versed in architecture; Antonio Gonzales de Quijano; and Tomas de Castro y Andrade. The petition to rebuild was sent to the king and was answered by a royal cedula requesting for plans and a budget for the cathedral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, the archbishop of Manila, Pedro Martinez Arizala, Abp 1744-55, persuaded De Uguccioni to take on the task of architect and overseer for the reconstruction of the Manila Cathedral. Corroborating the earlier assessment, De Uguccioni recommended complete demolition, but due to lack of funds, he had to build upon the remaining walls of the cathedral. He was assisted by Esteban de Rojas y Melo as <strong>obrero mayor</strong> (supervisor of construction). De Rojas, born in Llata, Peru, was ordained subdeacon in Nueva Caceres or Naga on 1 Oct 1736, and had been secretary of the bishops and member of the Cathedral canons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>De Uguccioni patterned the cathedral&rsquo;s facade after the Il Gesu in Rome. Begun in 1751, the Manila Cathedral was not yet completely finished when it was inaugurated in 1760 by Abp Manuel Antonio Rojo y Viera, Arizala&rsquo;s successor. De Uguccioni became the favored architect of the church and state during the reign of Abp Rojo del Rio, Abp 1758-64, who became acting governor of the Philippines in 1761. The archbishop commissioned De Uguccioni to propose repairs on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>. In the same year he was sent to Cavite Puerto to find solutions to the flooding of the port city, built so close to the sea. Later he was asked to propose repairs for the Colegio de Santa Potenciana, organized for the education of the daughters of soldiers, and the buildings of the Seminario Conciliar de San Clemente, where De Uguccioni worked with the&nbsp;<em>sangley&nbsp;</em>(Chinese) stone mason Jeronimo Tongco.

		"text": "<p><b>Gabriel Formoso</b>&nbsp;(<strong>Gabriel Papa Formoso</strong>), also known as Gabby Formoso, was an architect. He was born in&nbsp;Manila on 9 Apr 1915. He died on&nbsp;23 Dec 1996. The son of Gregorio Formoso and Alvara Papa, he finished high school at Ateneo de Manila in 1933, then enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas School of Architecture where he graduated in 1937. Becoming a registered architect in 1939, he worked for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a> and later for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo Antonio</a>. He formed a partnership with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2631\">Luis Araneta</a>, then established his own office. From 1952 to 1988, he made 11 tours of the United States, South America, and Europe to observe trends in architecture, particularly in bank, hotel, and condominium design. Formoso, a fellow of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2705\">United Architects of the Philippines (UAP)</a>, was the founding chairman of the Kanlungan Architectural Foundation of the Philippines, organized by UAP fellows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In more than 40 years of practice, he designed about 80 buildings and more than 150 residences. His outstanding works include the Central Bank complex, 1970, and the Metropolitan Museum, 1973, both on Roxas Blvd, Manila; the Valley Golf Club in Victoria Valley, Antipolo, Rizal, 1960; the Alabang Golf and Country Club in Alabang, Muntinlupa, 1978; the Development Academy of the Philippines in Tagaytay City, 1974; and the Club Filipino in Greenhills, San Juan, 1960. His buildings in Makati include the Pacific Star Building on Makati Ave, 1990; the Bank of America&ndash;Lepanto Building on Paseo de Roxas, 1978; the Nikko Manila Garden Hotel on EDSA, 1974; the Manila Peninsula Hotel on Ayala Ave, 1974; the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) on Paseo de Roxas, 1970; and the Do&ntilde;a Narcisa de Leon Building on Paseo de Roxas, 1967.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While some of Formoso&rsquo;s buildings are characterized by cool elegance, others are notable for their warmth and ruggedness. The Pacific Star Building, with its towering arches and classic lines, is remarkable for its refinement and serenity. The Central Bank Buildings are a harmonious composition of massive concrete blocks relieved of their severity by continuous horizontal bands of windows. Wooden panels, rugged stonework, and bold concrete masses give the exterior of the AIM both warmth and virility. The wooden panels evoke the <strong>bandeja</strong> (traylike) panels of the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\">bahay na bato</a>&nbsp;</strong>(house of stone).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a statement on his philosophy of design, Formoso emphasizes three points: first, architecture is a fine art committed to creating beauty; second, the social nature of architecture places a unique responsibility on the architect&mdash;that is, a building becomes part of the environment and functions in a dynamic interaction with it; and third, architecture must strive for simplicity. While his work faithfully reflects his philosophy, it is further characterized by a sensitivity to native tradition. This is especially evident in his residences, with their steep hip roofs and elegant woodwork. Formoso set a trend in the Club Filipino in Greenhills, which paid homage to the bahay na bato and affirmed the continuing relevance of certain traditional forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1977, Formoso received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award from the city of Manila. In 1990, the UAP conferred on him its highest honor, the Likha Award and Gold Medal of Merit. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

He was a founding member and first president of the International Council on Monuments and Sites Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For almost 13 years, since 1979, Jose worked at the Ayala Museum, starting as arts researcher and eventually becoming curator two years before he resigned. During this period, he was able to further advance his studies on Philippine colonial church arts.

		"text": "<p><strong>Winand Klassen</strong> (<strong>Winand Becker Klassen</strong>) is an architect, teacher, and scholar of architecture. He was born in Kettenkamp Municipality, Osnabruck District, Germany on 29 Jan 1930. His parents are August Klassen and Helene Becker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Fr Winand Klassen arrived in 1976 to teach architecture in the University of San Carlos in Cebu City, he had come well prepared for the job. As a youth, he labored in a construction site for six years. In 1951, he joined the Society of the Divine Word (SVD), studied for the priesthood in his native Germany and in the United States where he was ordained in 1963, then worked with an institution of SVD architects in Rome. As he steadily appraised the world of the architect through constant traveling around the country and through attending practitioners&rsquo;s conventions, Klassen proceeded to arm his students and colleagues by writing a series of books. These were <strong><em>History of Western Architecture</em></strong>, 1980;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/9/399\"><strong><em>Architecture in the Philippines</em></strong></a>, 1986, and reprinted in 2010; <strong><em>Architecture and Philosophy</em></strong>, 1990; and <strong><em>Architecture Gods and Mortals</em></strong>, 1994. All four were published by the University of San Carlos. Klassen also disseminated his views through articles in the <strong><em>Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society</em></strong> and through talks sponsored by the Goethe-Institut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>History&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>of Western Architecture</em></strong> is developed through a presentation of about 200 examples, each with a brief sketch of its historical background, architectural form, and interpreted meaning.&nbsp;<strong><em>Architecture in the Philippines&nbsp;</em></strong>is a virtual summation of all that was known then about the subject, with the added bonus of critical analyses not only of structures but of contemporary architects, architects&rsquo; associations, and architecture in Cebu. In <strong><em>Architecture and Philosophy</em></strong>, Klassen wrestles with philosophies that inform architectural thought, dialoguing not only with Thomism and active negativism but especially with phenomenology, hermeneutics, and deconstruction. These ideas are dealt with more deeply in <strong><em>Architecture Gods and Mortals</em></strong>, but this time with the express aim of moving the architect to keep on searching for meaning, thereby committing himself to build better architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collectively, the four-volume set is arguably the best textbook for Philippine architects to date. To be sure, his book on Western architecture contains far less examples than the classic <strong><em>A History of Architecture</em></strong> by Sir Banister Fletcher, revised several times and still used by many schools, including state universities. The volume on Philippine architecture was written just before the EDSA Revolt, and certainly needs to be updated. However, Klassen&rsquo;s prickly critiques and informed interpretations are invaluable in forming a young architect. Though the last two books are geared toward critical and ethical thinking, still they are free from the jargon and oblique statements that would plague later authors. Alone among his colleagues, Klassen rails againt kitsch&mdash;low quality material designed to appeal to current popular taste&mdash;a plea that runs through his four books. In being well illustrated with architectural and technical drawings, elevations, plans, cross sections, and site plans, Klassen&rsquo;s contributions remain unsurpassed by later works published in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with Arch Artemio S. Alcoseba, Klassen designed the church of Saint Arnold Janssen and Saint Joseph Freinademetz in the Talamban Campus of the University of San Carlos, 1984, and the San Vicente Ferrer parish church also in Cebu City, toward 1990. These structures are examples of Klassen&rsquo;s melding of local values with modern lines.

		"text": "<p><strong>Leandro V. Locsin</strong> (<strong>Leandro Valencia Locsin</strong>), also known as Lindy Locsin, was an architect. He is a National Artist for architecture. He was&nbsp;born in&nbsp;Silay, Negros Occidental on 15 Aug 1928. He&nbsp;died in Makati City on 15 Nov 1994. The eldest of Guillermo Locsin and Remedios Valencia&rsquo;s seven children, Locsin was named after his paternal grandfather Leandro de la Rama Locsin, who was the first elected governor of Negros Occidental under the American regime. He was married to Cecilia Yulo. They had two children, one of whom, Leandro Jr, is an architect. After finishing high school at De La Salle College in Manila in 1947, Locsin enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Conservatory of Music, intending to pursue music as a career, although he was even then interested in architecture. In 1949, he dropped the bachelor of music course and enrolled at the UST School of Architecture. While an architecture student, he worked as an artist-draftsman at the Ayala Corporation, which was then beginning the development of Makati. He graduated in 1953, and is one of very few major architects who did not train abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before establishing his practice, he designed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/47/29\">stage sets</a> for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballets</a> and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musical</a>. In 1954, Fr John Delaney, SJ, the University of the Philippines (UP) Catholic chaplain, commissioned him to design the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/395\">Chapel of the Holy Sacrifice</a> at the UP Diliman campus. Completed in 1955, the building was remarkable for its circular plan and three-inch thick concrete-shell dome. Within the next four years he designed an apartment building, two office buildings, and nine residences&mdash;a small number that nonetheless created an impact on the architectural scene. From 1955 to 1994, Locsin produced 75 residences, 88 buildings, and a state palace. The buildings include 11 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a> and chapels, 23 government buildings, 4 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/218\">apartment buildings</a>, 6 hotels, and 48 <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/224\">commercial buildings</a>. While his best-known works are located in Metro Manila, he also designed buildings in Dagupan, Cabanatuan, Batangas City, Naga, Bacolod, Iloilo, Tacloban, Mandaue, Cagayan de Oro, Ozamis, and Davao City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin&rsquo;s major accomplishments include the buildings at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\"> Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex</a>&mdash;the main building housing two theaters, a museum, and art galleries, 1969; the Folk Arts Theater, 1974; the Philippine Center for International Trade and Exhibitions or PHILCITE, 1976; the Philippine International Convention Center, 1976; and the Philippine Plaza Hotel, 1976. Other major works include the Hyatt Regency Hotel on Roxas Blvd, Pasay City, 1967; the Makati Stock Exchange Building, 1971, and the Ayala Museum (now replaced by another designed by his son), 1974, both on Makati Ave, Makati; the renovation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a>, 1976; the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Makati, 1976; the National Arts Center at Makiling, Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, 1976; and the terminal of the Manila International Airport (now Ninoy Aquino International Airport), 1979.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His largest and most spectacular work was the Istana Nurul Iman (Palace of the Light of Faith), the palace of the sultan of Brunei, which has a total floor area of 200,000 sq m, a grand reception hall accommodating 5,000, a throne room with a capacity of 2,000, and two mosques crowned by domes plated with 22-carat gold. Malayan and Islamic motifs, modern lines, and the latest building technology blend. With clean lines, strong masses, and daring structural design, Locsin&rsquo;s buildings are strikingly modern and original. But touches of nostalgia, the use of traditional forms and patterns, and the sculptural character of space and structure give his work a romantic spirit. His last work was the Church of the Monastery of the Transfiguration in Malaybalay, Bukidnon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1975, Locsin was commissioned by American dancer Martha Graham to design the sets for <strong><em>Lucifer</em></strong> and <strong><em>Adorations</em></strong>, which she created to mark the golden jubilee of her renowned modern dance company. Locsin and his wife co-authored <strong><em>Oriental Ceramics Discovered in the Philippines</em></strong>, 1967.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Locsin and his work are the subject of <strong><em>The&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Architecture of <strong><strong> <strong><strong>Leandro V.

In 1961, the American Institute of Architects Hawaii Chapter conferred on him the Pan-Pacific Citation for consistent excellence in design. These awards were followed by many others, among them the Rizal Centennial Award for architecture in 1962, the Republic Cultural Heritage Award in 1970, the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award in 1972, and the Gold Medal of Merit from the Philippine Institute of Architects in 1978.

He died in&nbsp;Manila on 22 Jan 1952. He was the son of the painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> (Juan Luna de San Pedro) and Paz Pardo de Tavera. He married Grace V. McCrae. With his father and his uncle <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5468\">Antonio Luna</a>, the young Luna came home to Manila in 1894. Luna&rsquo;s early schooling was at Ateneo de Manila. He took art lessons under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\">Miguel Zaragoza</a>, then came under the tutelage of Ramon Santa Coloma and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3574\">Lorenzo Guerrero</a>. Although Luna wanted to become a painter like his father, the latter advised him to be an architect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He studied ceramics in Japan, then returned to Manila and took the course in architecture in the International Correspondence School. The school granted him a diploma in 1911. The following year he went to Paris, France, and studied under Charles Gilardi, artist and builder; then he enrolled at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and worked in the office of Paulin, a French architect. In 1918, he was recognized as an&nbsp;<em>architect diplome&nbsp;</em>by the French government. He worked in the office of Emil Bertoner, a government architect. He was admitted into the Societe Centrale des Architectes Francais.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After serving as architect of the city of Manila, 1920-24, he went into private practice and trained young Filipino architects who worked under him. Luna served as president of the Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA) in its early years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although schooled in the academic and revivalist beaux arts style, Luna became one of the pioneers of modern design for a school in the Philippines. His work shows that he was at home with both the revivalist and modern styles, using them with impeccable taste and a flair for elegance. A photograph in the <strong><em>Philippine Review</em></strong> of Oct 1920 shows his design in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neobaroque</a> style, which won a prize in Paris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His works in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">revivalist</a> style include the Legarda Elementary School, built in 1922; the Alfonso Zobel house on Dewey (now Roxas) Blvd and Padre Faura; the Jacobo Zobel house, now demolished near the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/331\">Malate Church</a>; the San Vicente de Paul Chapel (now Church) on San Marcelino St, built ca 1930; and the Rafael Fernandez house on Arlegui St, remodeled in 1976 and used by Pres Corazon Aquino as her official residence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Works in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> and modern styles include the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\">Perez-Samanillo Building</a> on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1429\">Crystal Arcade</a>&nbsp;also on the Escolta and destroyed during World War II; the Fernandez-Martinez house on Gen Solano St, San Miguel, Manila; and Saint Cecilia&rsquo;s Hall of St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College, also destroyed during World War II, but restored after the war.

He and painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\">Arturo Luz</a> are sons of landowners Valeriano Luz and Rosario Dimayuga of Lipa, Batangas. His mother was an interior designer. After finishing high school at Ateneo de Manila in 1940, Luz enrolled at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) School of Architecture. World War II interrupted his studies. After the war, he left for the United States and studied at the University of California (UC) Berkeley, where he received an award of distinction for one of his designs. In 1949, he graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He returned to Manila in 1950 and, upon receiving his license, began his practice with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2698\">Carlos Santos-Viola</a>, with whom he organized the firm Luz-Santos-Viola. After the partnership ended, Luz established his own office. In 1964, he organized AJ Luz Associates, an integrated architectural and engineering firm that offered a wide range of services for domestic and international projects. In 1967, Luz migrated to Canada after selling out to his partners. The firm was renamed Arcenas and Payumo Associates. In Canada, Luz worked briefly in the Ericksen-Massey architectural firm, then for 10 years with Townley Matheson and Partners as a partner. He returned to the Philippines in 1978 and opened a new office, Ameca Total Construction System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The major projects of AJ Luz Associates include the regional headquarters for the World Health Organization on Taft Ave, Manila, 1958; Far East Bank and Trust Company head offices in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>, 1959-60; the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna, 1961; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/365\">Ramon Magsaysay Building</a> on Roxas Blvd, Manila, 1966.

		"text": "<p><strong>Juan F. Nakpil</strong> (<strong>Juan Felipe de Jesus Nakpil</strong>) was an architect. He is a National Artist for architecture. He was born in&nbsp;Manila on 26 May 1899. He died in&nbsp;Manila on 7 May 1986. He was the only son of composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4093\"><strong> <strong> </strong></strong>Julio Nakpil</a> <strong><strong> </strong> </strong> and Gregoria de Jesus, the widow of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>. He was married to Anita Noble, by whom he had three sons, Ariston and Francisco, both architects, and Eulogio, a civil engineer. After graduating from Manila High School in 1917, Nakpil took up engineering at the University of the Philippines (UP). Then he enrolled at the University of Kansas, where he obtained a civil engineering degree in 1922. While studying in Kansas he supported himself by playing the piano for the Filipino String Orchestra. He also studied in France, where he obtained a diploma in architecture from the Fontainebleau School of Fine Arts in 1925. The following year, 1926, he received a master&rsquo;s degree in architecture from Harvard University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nakpil returned to Manila in 1926 and worked as assistant architect in the Bureau of Public Works. In 1928, he became a partner in the firm of architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a> and structural engineer Jose G. Cortes, and with them designed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/357\">Perez-Samanillo Building</a> on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/419\">Escolta</a>. As the designer of Puyat and Sons, 1928-31, he introduced <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">art deco</a> motifs into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> industry. In 1930, he won second prize in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\">Bonifacio Monument</a> Competition. That same year he opened his own office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He taught at Mapua Institute of Technology, 1927-31, and at the University of Santo Tomas, 1931-38. In addition, he took part in various initiatives to upgrade building standards and improve the condition of architects&mdash;for example, through the Building Code Committee of Manila. Soon after World War II he formed a partnership with his cousin <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2680\">Angel E. Nakpil</a> and his brother-in-law <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2698\">Carlos Santos-Viola</a>. In 1953, with his sons, he formed a partnership, Juan F. Nakpil and Sons. Both Ariston (b. 1928) and Francisco (b. 1929) had obtained a master&rsquo;s degree in architecture from Cranbrook Academy, while Eulogio (b. 1931) had obtained a master&rsquo;s degree in civil engineering from Yale University. The partnership was dissolved after the death of Ariston in 1981. Nakpil was one of the founders and the first president of the Philippine Architects&rsquo; Society, established in 1933, which later became the Philippine Institute of Architects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the start of his career and together with his sons, he designed more than 200 buildings, including office buildings, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">movie houses</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">school buildings</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a>, and residences. His first building, the Geronimo de los Reyes Building, was in the art deco style, with which he became familiar when he visited the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs in Paris in 1925. Other major works before World War II include the Capitan Pepe Building, the Quezon Institute Administration Building and Pavilions, the Manila Jockey Club, the Avenue Hotel and Theater, Quiapo Church (the nave of which has been altered), and the residence of Gen Vicente Lim on Vito Cruz, Pasay City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The range of his style is represented in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/217\">neobaroque</a> Quiapo Church; the art deco Nakpil-Bautista Pylon at the North Cemetery, which combined stylized flora and angular forms; and the Manila Jockey Club, done in the then-emerging International Style, notable for its minimal surface decor and for the facade&rsquo;s interplay between two rounded forms: the entrance hall and the glass-enclosed circular stairwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His major works after the war include the Philippine Trust Building on Plaza Goiti and the Security Bank and Trust Building constructed in 1954. Nakpil undertook the reconstruction of the Rizal house in Calamba, Laguna, which was completed in 1950.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the immediate postwar period, the buildings of Juan Nakpil and his sons, as exemplified by the UP Administration and Library Buildings, and Ever and State Theaters on Rizal Ave, at first kept to the rigors of the International Style. However, in the 1960s, an exuberant warmth began to affirm itself. The use of folded plate as a structural shell encouraged the use of diamond-shaped supports on the exterior. Within appeared a rich play of textures: pebble-washed floors, adobe screen walls, wooden stairs and screens with a natural finish. Examples of this new style were the now-demolished Rizal Theater in Makati, the Baldwin Young house in Forbes Park, the Rufino Building on Ayala Ave, and the Commercial Bank and Trust Company Building at the Quezon Blvd rotunda in Quezon City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nakpil received the Gold Medal of Merit in 1950 from the Philippine Institute of Architects, and was named Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1954. In 1968, he was given the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award by the city of Manila.

Murphy through Executive Order 451 in 1933 to identify, designate, and mark historic sites in the country. The PHRMC introduced the cast iron plaque with black background and white letters, which has remained as the type of historical marker used to the present.

He died on&nbsp;10 May 1984.&nbsp;He was the son of Dr Basilio Ocampo and Leoncia Hizon. With his wife Lourdes Luciano, he had four children, one of whom, Fernando Jr, became an architect. Ocampo graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from Ateneo de Manila in 1914, then studied surveying at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) where he graduated with a civil engineering degree in 1919. After earning an architecture degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1921, he took advanced architectural studies at the American Academy in Rome in 1922. He worked in the architectural firm of Ballinger and Perrot in Philadelphia. In 1923, he began working in the architecture division of the Bureau of Public Works, and in 1926 was named assistant architect. He started private practice in 1928 and formed a partnership with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2636\">Tomas Arguelles</a>. Ocampo was one of the founders of the UST School of Fine Arts and Architecture, established in 1930, and a member of the Board of Examiners for Architects, 1929-30.

At Yale, one of his classmates was Francis Burton Harrison, who became governor-general of the Philippines.

He died in&nbsp;Quezon City on 31 Jul 1994. One of the six children of Melecio de Guzman Santos and Miguela Magpitang Antonio, his siblings included Miguela, Cezar, Adriana, Cleotilde, and Jorge. He married Caridad Nakpil, architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>&rsquo;s youngest sister. He and Caridad had five children: Rosario, Milagros, Paz, Lourdes, and Carlos Jr. He grew up in a&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\">bahay na bato</a>&nbsp;</strong>(stone house) in San Miguel, whose basic form he later reinterpreted in the private residences that he designed. From San Miguel Elementary School, he moved to Ateneo de Manila to finish his high school in 1930. In Ateneo, he joined the school band and was active in playing basketball. He also played the saxophone and enjoyed lawn tennis throughout his life. He was one of the first graduates of the College of Architecture of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in 1935. His professors were outstanding architects and engineers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2636\">Tomas Arguelles</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2686\">Fernando Ocampo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, and Juan Nakpil. He placed 10th in the board examinations for architects in 1938. He worked as an assistant architect for Wurdemann &amp; Beckett, building the Jai Alai court and gallery on Taft Ave, Manila, and in the office of Juan Nakpil as a draftsman. He became an associate architect in Juan Nakpil&rsquo;s office in 1946 until 1950, when he set up his own office. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2672\">Alfredo Luz</a> was his partner for some time.

In contrast to the INC churches, Santos-Viola&rsquo;s Catholic churches are markedly horizontal. Among these are the Our Lady of Lourdes in Quezon City; the Franciscan churches of Singalong, Mandaluyong-Pasig, Tagaytay, and Lipa City; and the most visually satisfying, Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia in Ermita, Manila. Some of his more important residential designs were for Hilario Zialcita, Ford Wilkins, Pablo Sarangaya, Manuel Locsin, Bienvenido Tantoco, and Jorge Vargas.

		"text": "<p><b>Ildefonso P. Santos</b> (<strong>Ildefonso Paez Santos Jr</strong>), also known as IP Santos or&nbsp;Sir IP, was a landscape architect. He is a National Artist for architecture.&nbsp;He was born in Malabon, Rizal on 5 Sep 1929. He died on&nbsp;29 Jan 2014. His parents were Ildefonso Santos and Asuncion Paez. His father, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5687\">Ildefonso Sr</a>, was an educator and a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> poet, who wrote under the pen name Ilaw Silangan (Eastern Light). He was married to Amparo Eugenio, with whom he had four daughters. He got two bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in architecture, one from the University of Santo Tomas, 1954, and another from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles (USCLA), 1956, and a master&rsquo;s degree also from USCLA, 1960. He worked with Cornell, Bridgers, and Trollers, landscape architects, in Los Angeles, 1955-63. Upon returning to Manila in 1963, he established his own firm, undertaking projects in the Philippines, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Guam, Thailand, Singapore, Taipei, and Bahrain. Since 1964 he lectured at the University of the Philippines (UP). He was designated as landscape architectural consultant for the UP campus in 1965. In 1971, he introduced in UP the first Philippine undergraduate program in tropical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscape architecture</a>. He was appointed as head of the university&rsquo;s graduate program in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was president of the Philippine Association of Landscape Architects, 1977-85, and was elected fellow in 1985. He was a member of the Board of Examiners for Landscape Architecture of the Professional Regulation Commission, 1982-1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santos transformed the image of the landscape architect as a glorified gardener to an architectural profession that requires the knowledge of architecture, engineering, and aesthetics and the ability to plan irrigation, drainage, lighting, and a comprehensive topographical analysis in landscaping. Santos&rsquo;s landscapes take advantage of the rich bounty of tropical foliage and plants. His projects take into account the need for shade, close-seating, conversation, and social interaction, and is sensitive to the psychological, behavioral, and social needs of the Filipinos. This gives his works a distinctive Filipino feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His projects include landscaping for hotels, commercial and shopping centers, banks, resorts, sports complexes, memorial parks, parks and playgrounds, office buildings, condominiums, subdivisions, and housing projects. His first major project was with the Makati Commercial Center where he introduced landscape walks, fountains, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a> as part of a strip mall. Among his larger projects were the Batulao Village Club in Batangas, the Caliraya Lake Resort in Laguna, the Eternal Gardens Memorial Park in Caloocan City, the Loyola Memorial Park in Manila and Para&ntilde;aque, the Imus town plaza in Cavite, and the Raintree Sports Club in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At Rizal Park in Manila, Santos did the Artists&rsquo; Village, the Garden for the Blind, the Teodoro F. Valencia Circle, the rehabilitation of the Japanese Garden, and the setting up of the Execution of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Dr Jose Rizal</a><strong> </strong> site. He also did the landscaping for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/373\">San Miguel Corporation Building</a>, the defunct Nayong Filipino, Paco Park, Asian Institute of Management, all in Metro Manila; the Tagaytay Highlands Golf and Country Club, Tagaytay, Cavite; Mount Malarayat Golf and Country Club Lipa, Batangas, and Orchard Golf and Country Club, Imus, Cavite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Santos wrote papers on landscape architecture in the Philippines and in the context of a developing country. He also accumulated an impressive library on landscape architecture with about 1,200 books, published from 1960 to 2010. His collection was formally turned over to the UP College of Architecture Library in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1972, the city of Manila conferred on Santos the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinangan award. In 1979, Malaca&ntilde;an gave him a plaque of appreciation for his work in Nayong Filipino. In 1986, he was named Outstanding Landscape Architect by the United Garden Clubs of the Philippines and the Garden Clubs of the Philippines in 1988.

		"text": "<p><strong>Antonio Sede&ntilde;o </strong>was a Jesuit priest, architect, and builder. He was<strong>&nbsp;</strong>born in&nbsp;San Clemente, diocese of Cuenca&nbsp;in 1535. He died in&nbsp;Cebu on 1 Sep 1595. Antonio Sede&ntilde;o was 46 years old when he arrived in Manila on 17 Sep 1581. Before he joined the Jesuits on 25 Apr 1559, he worked for the duke of Feria, where he learned the principles and techniques of construction. Prior to the Philippines, Sede&ntilde;o had been rector of the German College in Rome and a veteran of the Florida mission. When the third general San Francisco de Borja closed Florida, Sede&ntilde;o was sent to Mexico, where he founded a college. Intending to volunteer for Japan, he could not get passage as no ship was sailing. While waiting for the next ship, he received the order from Borja&rsquo;s successor, Everard Mercurian, to head a mission to the Philippines. He left for the Philippines with Fr Alonso Sanchez, Bro Nicolas Gallardo, and Gaspar Suarez de Toledo. Suarez died on board the ship. Sede&ntilde;o&rsquo;s original directive was not to establish a permanent mission but to reconnoiter and report to Rome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the trip across the Pacific, he befriended Domingo de Salazar, OP, who was sent to Manila to be its first bishop. This friendship would benefit the development of colonial architecture. In Aug 1583, after a fire consumed Manila, then a humble collection of thatch, bamboo, and timber houses, Salazar asked Sede&ntilde;o to rebuild the bishop&rsquo;s residence using more permanent material. On an earlier exploratory trip up the Pasig River, the bishop came upon the&nbsp;<em>adobe&nbsp;</em>outcrops of Guadalupe. Quarrying the stones in Guadalupe, slaking lime from oyster shells, and hewing tropical hardwood, a team of workers, drawn from the Chinese artisans and workers in Manila, was directed by Sede&ntilde;o. After completing the bishop&rsquo;s residence, Gov-Gen Santiago de Vera asked Sede&ntilde;o to build a fortification for Manila. He built Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de Guia in 1587, a tower designed, said its critics, in the medieval style. In 1595, when Gov-Gen Luis Perez de Dasmari&ntilde;as began replacing the palisade around Manila with stonewalls, the tower was integrated into the city&rsquo;s defenses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1590, Sede&ntilde;o began his most ambitious project, a church for the Jesuits in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>. Named after Santa Ana, the mother of the Virgin Mary, the church was almost complete in 1595. That same year, Sede&ntilde;o was appointed vice-provincial of the Jesuits in the Philippines and a royal decree designated islands and provinces to the different orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sede&ntilde;o did not complete the year. Traveling by boat to Cebu, where he had asked Pedro Chirino to establish a central house for the Visayas, he was caught in a storm and arrived in Cebu quite ill. He died in the house Chirino had prepared, a gift of Lt Henao, a benefactor of the Jesuits. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2663\">Ren&eacute; B.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>United Architects of the Philippines</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>UAP</strong>)&nbsp;was established in 1974 and since then has been the only professional organization of architects in the country. Like all other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/257\">architectural organizations</a>, it was established by architects in order to foster unity and cooperation among themselves, thresh out common problems in the profession, uplift the standards of architectural education, and work for the development and upgrading of the profession and the welfare of its practitioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Spanish era, there were no <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/259\">schools of architecture</a> in the Philippines. Filipinos had to learn the skill of erecting architectural structures from a master builder who preceded him in the craft. In the last decade of the 19th century, the Spanish government opened the first formal school for master builders, the Escuela Practica de Artes y Oficios de Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under a civil government established by the Americans in 1901, highways, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/251\">bridges</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>, and government buildings transformed the Philippine landscape. In 1902, many graduates of the Escuela bonded with the civil engineers and surveyors in the country to found the first professional organization of architects and allied professions, the Academia de Arquitectura y Agrimensura de Filipinas. A year after, the academy changed its name to Academia de Ingenieria, Arquitectura, y Agrimensura de Filipinas (AIAAF).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1911, the engineers withdrew to form their own professional organization, but not before the AIAAF had struggled for the passage of an engineers&rsquo;s and architects&rsquo;s law. Act No. 2985, the first enabling law for the practice of the separate professions of engineering and architecture, was enacted later, in 1921. The first batch of Filipino architects was registered on the basis of this act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In view of the growing number of architects, the Philippine Architects Society was organized on the initiative of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2681\"> Juan F. Nakpil</a>. The first officers of the society were Juan F. Nakpil, president; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2677\">Tomas Mapua</a>, vice president; Harold H. Keys, secretary-treasurer; and Sidney D. Rowlands and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2686\">Fernando H. Ocampo</a>, directors. Among its early accomplishments were the draft of its constitution and by-laws, the rules of charges and professional fees, and the code of ethics of the society. One of the aims of the society was to seek the passage of a law by the National Assembly that would protect the architectural profession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1938, the society was renamed Philippine Institute of Architects and Planners and, subsequently, Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA). In 1946, the PIA held its first annual convention. In 1950, about 15 members left the institute and formed the League of Philippine Architects (LPA). It was led by some eminent architects at the time: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2630\">Pablo S. Antonio</a>, Antonio V. Ba&ntilde;as, Pablo D. Panlilio, Jose L. Reynoso, and Elias L. Ruiz. They elected the much younger Jose V. Herrera as the league&rsquo;s first president. The schism gave rise to two architects&rsquo;s organizations vying for the membership of the 350 registered architects at the time. (By 1962 LPA membership had grown to 600 when there were about 2,200 registered architects.) In 1955, the Boards of the Institute and the League met to discuss the merger of the organizations, but with no result. In 1957, the PIA was admitted as an affiliate organization of the Union Internationale des Architectes (UIA). The PIA College of Fellows was created in 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architects in the government service formed their own association in 1958 and named it Association of Philippine Government Architects (APGA). In 1965, the PIA, LPA, and APGA passed resolutions approving the Architect&rsquo;s National Code and the Architects&rsquo; Services and Schedule of Fees, which had been prepared by the PIA. Negotiations for the merger of the three organizations continued, but still fruitless. An attempt to have an umbrella organization to unify the three organizations was made by LPA and APGA by organizing the Council of Filipino Architects (CFA), but it was not recognized by PIA. However, it authored what resulted in Presidential Proclamation 934 Series of 1971, designating the second week of December as Nationwide Architecture Week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presidential Decree 223, was issued by Pres Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1973. Under this decree, the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) was authorized to regulate all professions and to accredit only one organization for each profession. Pursuant to this, the three architectural organizations voluntarily integrated into the United Architects of the Philippines (UAP). In 1974, the Boards of PIA, LPA, and APGA approved the constitution and by-laws of the UAP. PRC certified the accreditation of UAP as the only accredited professional organization for architects in the Philippines, with PRC Certificate of Accreditation No. 001 on 12 May 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAP aims to promote the highest standards of ethical conduct and excellence in the practice and service of the profession as well as upliftment of the standards of architectural education. The UAP is also committed to unify all registered architects of the Philippines through cooperation and coordination with allied professions, trade and industry, both local and international; participation in national development programs; and cooperation with the Board of Architecture and other government agencies. It is willing to render any lawful and appropriate assistance to any of its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the meeting of the Union Internationale des Architectes (UIA) in Hawaii in Jun 1982, the UIA Bureau concluded that according to laws of the Philippines, the UAP is the only organization with the right to represent the Filipino architects in the Philippines and internationally, particularly in the UIA. In the UIA Council at Santiago, Chile, in Apr 1983, a certification to this effect was issued to UAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAP is one of the founding member-institutes of the Architects Regional Council Asia. Established in 1979, it is composed of the architects&rsquo;s organizations of Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines. It was later joined by Country Institutes of Macau, China, Korea, Lao, Japan, Nepal, Mongolia, and Vietnam. In 1986, the Asian Congress Student Jamboree was launched, giving the would-be architects representing member-countries a chance to experience the benefits of an international conference. The UAP is also a lifetime member of the Eastern Regional Organization for Planning and Human Settlements (EAROPH).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, from the savings of its previous national presidents and contributions of members, the UAP was able to purchase a lot and initiate the construction of its own seven-story headquarters and offices in Quezon City, completed as of May 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The UAP is a four-time recipient of the PRC citation as &ldquo;Most Outstanding Accredited Professional Organization of the Year&rdquo; (2002, 2007, 2008, and 2011). It also received the EAROPH Golden Jubilee Award in recognition of its substantial contribution to the advancement of planning, development, and management of human settlements in the Philippines. It is the first accredited professional organization to receive the Father Neri Satur Award for Environmental Heroism, 2009. It was commended by the National Economic and Development Authority&ndash;Philippine National Service Coordinating Agency as one of the &ldquo;Outstanding Volunteers&rdquo; in Region IV and by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority as a valuable partner in its Urban Renewal Program. The Metrobank Foundation also honored the UAP as a Partner in Empowerment, Advocacy, and Commitment to Excellence or PEACE. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2693\">Rodrigo D.

He died in&nbsp;Makati City on 5 May 2018. Villalon&rsquo;s father, Augusto P. Villalon, belongs to a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> family whose ancestral home is on a mountaintop in Cebu&rsquo;s Guadalupe district, overlooking uptown Cebu and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/285\">Cebu Capitol</a>. His mother, Evelyn Fabella, is the daughter of Dr Jose Fabella who was the first secretary of health and public welfare during the Commonwealth era and member of the first board of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/305\">Gota de Leche</a>.

He was born in&nbsp;Manila on 6 Dec 1912. He died on 26 Nov&nbsp;1994. He was the son of Elias Zaragoza, an electrical and mechanical engineer, and Rosario Velez. His grandfather Jose Zaragoza was the owner and editor of <strong><em>La Ilustracion Filipina</em></strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>Two granduncles were distinguished artists, the painter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\">Miguel Zaragoza</a> and the architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2696\">Felix Roxas</a>. His wife, Pilar Rosello, is an interior designer; their son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2709\">Ramon</a> is an architect. Zaragoza finished high school at San Beda, and then studied architecture at the University of Santo Tomas where he obtained his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in 1936, with highest honors. He holds a diploma in liturgical art and architecture from the International Institute of Liturgical Art in Rome, and a diploma in comprehensive planning from the Hilversum Technical Research Center in the Netherlands. Zaragoza was an honorary fellow of the American Institute of Architects. He was also a fellow of the Philippine Institute of Architects (PIA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1938, Zaragoza has designed 36 office buildings; 5 public buildings; 15 airport terminal offices; 4 hotels; 2 hospitals; 45 churches, chapels, and religious centers; 5 low-cost and middle-income housing projects; 15 middle-income condominiums; and over 270 residences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His major projects include the Meralco Building in Pasig; Our Lady of the Holy Rosary in Tala, Novaliches; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/379\">Santo Domingo Church</a> and Convent in Quezon City; Villa San Miguel, Mandaluyong; Pius XII Catholic Center, Manila; Saint John Bosco Parish Church in Pasay Road, Makati; Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal Shrine in Sucat, Para&ntilde;aque; the Philippine Airlines Building on Ayala Ave, Makati; the Philippine Banking Corporation Building at Port Area, Manila; the Union Church in Makati, built 1975, now demolished; Virra Mall, Greenhills, built 1975, demolished 2005; and the Bataan Power Plant of the National Power Corporation. As a member of Hexagon Associated Architects, he was one of those who designed the National Library on T. M. Kalaw, Manila. Low-cost housing projects designed by him include the Saint Joseph the Worker housing project in Pasig and the Tala Leprosarium Housing in Novaliches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Meralco Building, a 15-story office building, is slightly curved to give it more stability and to avoid the boxlike appearance of rectangular buildings and &ldquo;train effect&rdquo; of straight corridors. Tapering vertical sunbreakers enhance the gentle curve of the concave facade. The 1,000-seat Meralco Theater was designed for musical and theatrical presentations, as well as for international conferences. The most famous building by Zaragoza is the present Santo Domingo Church and Convent, which follows the plan of the church-tower-<strong>convento</strong> (parish house) complex of the colonial period. While the building embodies the simplicity of modern design, such features as arches give it a traditional touch.

His parents are National Artist for architecture <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2708\">Jose Ma. Zaragoza</a> and Pilar Rosello. Ramon Ma. Zaragoza comes from a family of architects and engineers. The Zaragoza&rsquo;s Philippine lineage traces to Rafael Zaragoza who worked in Nueva Ecija in the tobacco industry of the 19th century. He had two children, Jose and Miguel. Jose married Rosa Roxas of Quiapo, whose son Elias is Ramon&rsquo;s grandfather. Elias was an engineer who graduated from Yale University in 1906. Elias married Rosario Velez y Infante, thus associating the family with Guagua, Pampanga. He studied at the University of Santo Tomas (UST).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ramon studied at De La Salle, completing his elementary years in 1959 and his secondary years in 1963. He obtained a bachelor of science in architecture from UST in 1967. He went to Spain and studied at the Escuela Tecnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid, where he took a postgraduate course in town planning and urban renewal from 1967 to 1968. During this same period, he also studied at the Instituto de Cultura Hispanica, Madrid, where he studied Spanish art. On 5 Jan 1970, he passed the board examination for architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ramon worked closely with his father but came to be known for his restoration works and advocacy expressed through a number of books that he wrote. As an advocate of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/6/255\">heritage conservation</a>, he succeeded his father in working on the restoration of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\">Intramuros</a>. From 1980 to 1990, he worked on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/310\">walls of Intramuros</a>, its <strong>baluarte</strong> or bastions, fausse-braye, moats, and drawbridges. He also worked on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>&rsquo;s gate, bridge, and moat and the Plaza de Armas. He also worked on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/4/216\">landscaping</a> and monumental lighting of this historic city. He has also been actively involved in the restoration of heritage structures, like the Shrine of Baldomero Aguinaldo at Binakayan, Cavite; Ermita de San Nicolas de Tolentino, West Rembo, Makati; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">San Agustin Church</a>, Intramuros; and Santa Ana Church, Santa Ana, Pampanga. In 1993, he authored a master plan for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/429\">Vigan</a>, which recommended that families bear responsibility for the maintenance and restoration of their heritage houses, rather than depend on foreign funding. He recommended that the historic district of Vigan, along Crisologo St be closed off to traffic, warehouses transferred elsewhere, and old residences be reused for tourism as inns, restaurants, and stores. He moved for the dredging of the Mestizo and Govantes Rivers, the removal of illegal fishpens, and the reopening of the Vigan port and the Vigan airport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His advocacy for heritage conservation took on a personal turn when he restored a house in Vigan, originally owned by the Encarnacion family. He purchased the house in 1998. In the restoration, some items from the Zaragoza house in Quiapo, like capiz windows, knocker and iron items were incorporated in the restored Vigan house. The house is L-shaped in plan and dated to the 1790s. The house has an inner patio, a unique feature among the Vigan houses. The house was blessed and dedicated to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Paz y Buenviaje, hence the name Villa Paz, and the patio dedicated to the Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Pilar in honor of Ramon&rsquo;s mother (Zaragoza 2004, 220-75). The house is also known as Museo Zaragoza. In 2005, he restored the altar of the Shrine of the Miraculous Medal in Sucat, Para&ntilde;aque, which his father Jose had designed in 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is the author of <strong><em>Old Manila</em></strong>, 1990, which had a Japanese edition; <strong><em>Lost Era</em></strong>, 1994; <strong><em>La Ilustracion Filipina: 1891-1894</em></strong>, 1992; <strong><em>The Philippines Images of the Past</em></strong>, 1993; and <strong><em>Zaragoza: The Art of Restoration</em></strong>, 2005.
