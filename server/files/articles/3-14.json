Through the creative and imaginative use of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials</a>, various art forms have developed as a response to existing social, cultural, economic, and political conditions of an era. Whichever manner the parcel of history is expressed, the visual art forms in every historical period reflect the triumphs and struggles of the time. Many of these art forms have shown resiliency and dynamism in adapting to the changing conditions, thus retaining their relevance to contemporary times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the study of the visual arts, a balanced understanding of the contexts of production,<b> </b>circulation, and reception of art helps in creating a deeper appreciation of its significance in Philippine history, culture, and society. Art production focuses on the material, technique, and social forces that have influenced the creativity of the artists; the circulation of art points to various ways an art form can be disseminated in society, while reception implies the importance of audience, perceiver, and users of these art forms. People engage with these art forms in various contexts, whether they are part of everyday life, used as decoration in houses and places of worship, studied in schools, appropriated in mass media, exhibited in museums, or collected by art connoisseurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In each historical period in Philippine history, it is therefore necessary to have an understanding of the following factors: (1) a sense of location, which evokes land and people, material resources, geopolitical space, local culture, town, city, metropolis, nation, and diaspora; (2) religion and belief systems such as mythology, rituals, worship, cosmology, folklore; (3) systems of patronage coming from the market economy, the state, individuals, communities, and social institutions; (4) encounters and interventions in art brought about by power relations such as colonialism, imperialism, resistances, war and revolutions, and global capitalism; (5) modes of exchange, which are influenced by trade systems and relations and mass media commodification; and (6) identity construction, which revolves around the issues of ethnicity, race, nationalism, social class, and gender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As art becomes a tool for understanding the human condition and the society, it becomes imperative to adopt a broader view of Philippine visual arts as a product of history and as it constructs history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:6.0pt\"><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a></span></span></span><strong>Indigenous Traditions and Transformations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ancient visual arts in the Philippines are invariably related to the Austronesian world that encompasses Asia and the Pacific. This is shown in the similarity of languages, lifeways, and art forms that have been unearthed through archaeological methods, exhibiting the integration of art in everyday life as well as in belief systems that art relates to. These art forms drew their origins from the indigenous cosmologies of the universe, from the rituals for fertility and abundant harvest, which ensured the survival of the human race.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The art forms connected to everyday life go through the processes of weaving, carving, molding, and building <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a>, which are used in the art forms of woven textile and mats, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\">dress</a> and headgear, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">personal ornamentations</a>, carvings, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2107\">metalcraft</a>, ritual implements, and decorations for festivals, food, and modes of transportation. These art forms and processes in the indigenous art traditions are characterized by the following: use of materials found in the immediate environment; valuation of handmade processes and localized technology; functional use in everyday life; and aesthetic connection with the traditional belief systems that are based on the physical environment. These art forms are also considered living traditions and are invariably related to other art expressions, both material and performative, within a specific locality and ethnicity. Therefore, as living traditions, the indigenous or local knowledge systems are an important component in its valuation in Philippine art as these become the vessel that represents the unique identities of Philippine culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Clay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">pottery</a> is among the most ancient arts, combining design and function. The<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2227\">Manunggul jar</a> excavated in Palawan is evidence of the high artistic level that the early Filipinos attained in ancient times. This large burial jar has a lid that features two men rowing in a boat, suggesting the belief of the early Filipinos in an afterlife that the departed reaches after crossing a body of water. Around its body are incised geometric patterns of scallops and dots. Another outstanding example is the<b><i> </i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2158\">Calatagan jar</a><b><i> </i></b>whose body contains inscriptions, which have gone through a process of deciphering. Scholars have documented examples of early Philippine pottery showing a wide variety of shapes and decorative techniques, such as incision, stippling, appliqu&eacute;, openwork, and design impressions by rope and mat, usually geometric with stylized nature motifs. The anthropomorphic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2224\">Maitum burial jars</a> in Sarangani Province depict facial characteristics and emotions of sadness and happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Indigenous pottery that survive to this day are primarily functional, examples of which are the <b>palayok</b> (clay pot) for cooking, and the <b>banga</b> (clay jar) and the <b>tapayan</b> (liquid container) for storing liquids, salt, and other substances. In the Ilocos, the tradition of <b>burnay </b>pottery is much appreciated by pottery connoisseurs of the region. Many parts of the country continue their lively wood carving traditions up to the present day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cordillera groups carve <b>anito</b> figures called <b>bulol</b>, which double as ancestral spirits and granary gods. They are often found in male and female pairs to signify the value of fertility. Also integrated into parts of houses, such as door posts, as well as in household articles such as bowls, forks and spoons, and other objects for dining, are human and animal wood carving motifs like the <b>tat-tagu</b>. In the South, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> of Mindanao and Sulu are widely known for their <b>okir</b>, ornate curvilinear designs and motifs primarily applied to wood carving. The principal okir designs are the <b>sarimanok</b>, the <b>naga</b>, and the <b>pako rabong</b>. The sarimanok, carved in wood, varnished or painted in many colors (it is also executed in brass), is the stylized design of a bird, a kingfisher, holding a fish in its beak or standing on a base in the shape of a fish. While its meaning derives from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a> and myths, it also alludes to Lake Lanao with its fertile waters. The naga has the form of an elaborate, mythical serpent with a distinct S-curve and numerous curvilinear motifs to suggest its scales. The pako rabong is a stylized growing fern with a broad base gracefully tapering upward in many levels. The sarimanok and naga are found as design ornaments of the <i>panolong</i>, the extended floor beam of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\"><i>torogan</i></a> or the large sultan&rsquo;s house, as well as in its interior beams and posts. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> of Palawan carve wooden figures in the shape of different kinds of birds. Again, meanings are linked to religion and ritual, for birds play an important part in Tagbanwa mythology as messengers that link the many levels of the celestial realm. The animals and other creatures, such as the pig and wild boar, have a part in ritual as sacrificial offerings. These carvings are of blackened wood, incised with geometric designs that expose the original light tone of the wood. It also goes without saying that these carved creations also serve the social function of toys for children to play with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The art of weaving also originated in precolonial times and continues to the present. The Cordillera groups of the North are well-known for weaving. By means of the backstrap loom, produced are blankets and articles of clothing that not only fulfill a practical function but also play a part in religion and ritual. This tradition spills over into the adjacent Ilocos provinces, particularly the <b>abel</b> weave. In Mindanao, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> of Cotabato weave abaca cloth called<b> tnalak</b> using a difficult tie-dye process in a decorative dyeing technique. The cloth has a large repertoire of motifs, such as the <b>g&rsquo;mayaw</b> bird, created with the sense of flapping wings; the frog, which signifies fertility; and the dancing man, which calls for rain. These motifs attest to the Tboli&rsquo;s deep-seated sense of harmony between human beings and nature, expressed in song and dance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Different <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2106\">weaving</a> techniques are also used in the exquisite mats with vivid hues and intricate geometric designs done by the women of Sulu, particularly from the islands of Laminusa and Siasi. In the Visayas, Samar and Leyte are also known for their colorful mats with bird and flower designs. The large mat meant for family use implies strong familial values, at the same time reflecting the environment and even historical change. A favorite mat design in these parts is the long San Juanico Bridge, which has made travel between the provinces easier. The making of hats, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2096\">baskets</a>, and fans also use weaving techniques in materials such as rattan, buri, and nito. The Cordilleras are rich in baskets for all purposes, reflecting occupational needs related to rice planting on the mountain terraces, hunting in the forests, and fishing in the streams. The backpack called<b> pasiking</b>,<b> </b>for instance, is not only an example of good design but of efficient structure made to support the human frame. Aside from baskets and containers related to hunting and agricultural activities, there are also many kinds of bamboo fish traps with shapes and sizes to suit the different species of fish and crustaceans found in the rivers. Other more urbanized parts of the country excel in hat weaving. The Southern <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> region specializes in making fine buntal hats made of buri, which are on display during the fiestas of Lucban and Sariaya in Quezon Province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ancient jewelry using beads and precious metals, such as gold, points to an active interisland trade system during ancient times. The exchange of goods paved the way for cultural encounters and influences with neighboring cultures. This is exemplified by the presence of jade from China used in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2204\"><b>lingling-o</b></a><i> </i>jewelry found in Palawan and in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2191\"><b><i>Golden Image of Tara</i></b></a> in Agusan, 13th-14th century, as possible evidence of the Hindu influence from India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jewelry did not so much begin as personal adornment but as amulets and charms to ward off evil spirits and to give supernatural powers to the wearer. Later they assumed a purely ornamental character. The Cordillera groups have an ancient amulet design called the lingling-o, said to signify fertility, widely found in necklaces, rings, and earrings. In Southern Philippines, the Tboli create some of the most splendid body ornaments in brass chains and bells, strings and nets of multicolored beads, fine chains of horsehair neckpieces, earrings, rings, bracelets, and anklets. Related to religious belief and to social function, body ornaments<b> </b>are worn to please the gods, signify the status of the wearer, and enhance the wearer&rsquo;s physical charms. A belt made of a row of brass bells that tinkle with every movement calls attention to the approach of a young nubile girl. At times, body jewelry is worn along with elaborate tattoos on the body, especially around the arms and legs, which function as an indelible design with motifs from nature related to the animist worldview. The <b>anting-anting</b> or medals with mystical symbols and figures in relief are worn by the folk as amulets rather than as simply body ornaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Related to jewelry is metalwork in brass, bronze, gold, and silver done in the traditional lost-wax method using clay molds and liquefied metal, which hardens in the mold. Native metalwork technology includes the use of the Malay forge with a blower to heat the metal in the mold. The Tboli make lively brass figurines as a narrative form of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>, which depicts occupations and activities, work and play, apart from any practical function. The Maranao community of Tugaya around Lake Lanao specializes in making exquisite brass bowls and vessels of all kinds and shapes ornamented with delicate incisions and highlighted with gold and silver designs, which are used in ceremonial functions and serve as household status symbols. Among these are the large <b>gadur</b> and the spouted liquid container called <b>kendi</b>, both of which often form part of the wedding dowry. Again, these vessels combine practical function with aesthetic design, as seen in their elaborate geometric and curvilinear motifs. Also noteworthy is the variety of betel-nut boxes in metal, wood, or bamboo produced by many ethnic groups, attesting to the widespread social custom of betel chewing often referred to in the epics still extant among some Philippine groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The<b> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2118\">tattooing</a></b> tradition is closely related to the Austronesian cultural milieu, as it is considered a form of dress infused with concepts of valor, brotherhood, and social status. Considered a body art, tattooing was practiced by the Visayans, whom the Spaniards named Pintados<i> </i>(Painted Ones), illustrated in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2152\"><b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b></a>, 1590. A few indigenous communities still retain the practice of traditional tattooing, albeit with different meanings and connotations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Rich living traditions that go back to precolonial times survive despite centuries of colonization. The survival of the oldest arts is in large part due to the resistance of indigenous communities to colonial imposition. These arts constitute an important part of the cultural heritage attesting to the inexhaustible creativity of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>Hispanic Traditions and Transformations </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the coming of the Spaniards in the 16th century, Spanish colonization sought to replace indigenous culture with one in the image and likeness of the West. Art became a handmaiden of religion and served to propagate Christianity by means of beautiful images that appealed to the emotions while they supported the colonial order. Since the Church was the sole patron of the arts up to the end of the 18th century, the practice of art was under the strict supervision of the friars, and Western models were provided for artists to emulate. In time, what resulted, however, was not a Western culture but a colonial culture marked by a fusion of folk indigenous and Western elements. Despite the efforts of the colonizers to suppress the local culture, the imposed Western model eventually fused with indigenous elements, resulting in syncretic art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 17th century, engraving by means of the xylographic method using woodblocks, a Chinese printing method, was one of the first art forms introduced in the country. The first book produced in this method was <b><i>Doctrina Christiana en la Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola y Tagala</i></b> (Christian Doctrine in the Spanish and Tagalog Languages), which appeared in 1593. Published by the Dominicans, the image of Saint Dominic on the cover created a prototype. Later, typographic printing of books replaced the xylographic process. In the 17th century, copper engraving of holy images became widespread in the illustration of books, novenas, and lives of saints. Soon, a large number of Filipino engravers were recognized for their talent, among them <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3429\">Nicolas de la Cruz Bagay</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3783\">Francisco Suarez</a> who affixed the title &ldquo;Indio Tagalo&rdquo; (Tagalog Native) to their signatures. The art of engraving was also put to use in cartography or mapmaking, as in the map commissioned by Fr Murillo Velarde, which the engravers ornamented along the borders with local landscapes and genre scenes, possibly the first secular images in colonial art.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folk and local motifs also appeared in the various arts such as architecture, sculpture, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a> built all over the country exhibit the blend of Philippine folk and European classical or baroque. For instance, the relief stone carvings on the main pediment of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">Miag-ao church</a> in Iloilo feature a lively folk motif in the figure of Saint Christopher carrying the Child Jesus under a coconut tree in combination with curving balustrade motifs and ornate baroque medallions. The same decorative spirit is found in the church <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\">retablos</a> </b>(altarpieces, usually with niches for statues) ornamented with gilded Solomonic columns topped by broken pediments. The <b>relleves</b> or holy images in relief and icons or paintings on wood sport curlicues in floral motifs for their borders. The same is true for silver ornaments, for altars in the ornate plateresque style of the silversmiths, as well as for the <b>carrozas</b><i> </i>(floats) that bore the saints in procession. The <b>santos</b> (religious figures) enshrined in church retablos or displayed on private altars showed the convergence of East and West. In churches, statues in the formal style, done under the strict supervision of the ecclesiastical authorities, followed European aesthetic canons. Classical santos followed the prescribed proportions for the figure and conveyed the values of restraint and cool elegance, while those showing baroque influence, whether in wood or in ivory, had an emotional, expressionistic character. On the other hand, informal or folk santos drew from the indigenous sculpture styles of the angular and squat anitos with round preternatural eyes. The main reason for church supervision of religious art was to prevent the entry of unorthodox elements in church iconography.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The folk arts that fused the indigenous and the colonial elements found expression primarily in the many productions that revolved around the fiestas (religious festivals). A multitude of folk arts was developed with bright colors and exuberant forms and shapes. Outstanding were the Christmas lanterns or <b>parol</b>, the decorated Lenten palm fronds or <b>palaspas</b>, the colorful papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; horses or <b>taka</b>, <b>tinapay ni San Nicolas</b> (San Nicolas cookies), <i>pastillas </i>(candy made from carabao milk) with cutout wrappers, and brightly colored native delicacies or <i>sapin-sapin</i>. These arts continue to the present in regional folk art centers such as Paete, known for wood carving and taka. In Angono, a lakeshore town, the harvest festival brings out papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; giants and carabaos in a parade. In the Quezon towns of Lucban and Sariaya, the Maytime fiesta of San Isidro Labrador decks the houses in <b>kiping</b>, colorful leaf shapes made of rice flour formed into chandeliers called <b>arangya</b> and floral bouquets, covering all available space on the walls together with the harvest of fruits and grains, handicrafts, and other products of the town. The art of lantern making has culminated in the huge Christmas lanterns of San Fernando, Pampanga, which are virtual kaleidoscopes of color and movement synchronized by music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the Visayas, other centers of folk art related to church fiestas are Kalibo, Aklan, where the Christ child is honored with the Ati-atihan festival in January. The participants don the most spectacular costumes and headdresses in a combination of feathers, beads, and boar&rsquo;s teeth as in primitive art, while bodies are blackened with soot. In the towns of Marinduque, the Moriones festival, based on the story of Longinus, is characterized by wooden masks in strong colors that resemble Roman centurions with their towering headdresses. These folk arts that fuse the indigenous and the colonial with their Christian subjects were established to win the people over to Christianity. Wood carving as folk art is also practiced in the Laguna towns of Paete and Pakil, and in Betis, Pampanga. Paete wood-carvers perfected the art of carving santos from native hardwoods. After the initial coating of glue and plaster of paris (gesso) to create a nonporous ground, the work of the<b> encarnador</b> (finisher) consists in giving the image a rosy lifelike hue or ivory finish. A neighboring town, Pakil, is known for its fans and toothpick trees of exquisite filigree of wood from the light-toned <i>matang-araw</i> and <i>cayetana</i> trees of the Sierra Madre, as well as for its intricately carved <b>bakya</b> or wooden slippers, while the Betis wood-carvers apply their skills to urban sala sets and dining tables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the formal opening of the country to international trade in the mid-19th century, significant economic change came about with cash-crop agriculture. With the independence of Mexico and the loss of the royal subsidy for the Philippines, Spain let go of its monopoly on trade and opened the ports of the country. Foreign merchant houses owned by the British, French, Germans, and Americans established their offices along Manila Bay and stimulated the cash economy. The new situation opened positions for local agents and dealers to serve as liaison for the merchants. Moneylenders, mostly Chinese mestizos, flourished. Landlords converted from the traditional produce of rice to the new export crops in demand, such as sugar, coffee, abaca, and copra. The quota system was introduced thereby applying greater pressure on the peasant farmers. The surplus from the sale of the cash crops was accrued to the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated) class whose members became the new patrons of the arts. Higher education in the universities in Manila or abroad, in Spain and France, became accessible with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1859. The resulting culture developed new tastes geared toward Western aesthetics and art forms. At the same time, they became exposed in Europe to liberal ideas and spearheaded the reform movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An important effect of cash-crop agriculture was the boom in the construction of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><i>bahay na bato</i></a>, the mansion of wood and stone that confidently combined indigenous features with classical and baroque elements. For its well-appointed interiors, the ilustrados commissioned <b>retratos</b><i> </i>or portraits. Portraits flourished in this period and artists ably met the demand, sometimes traveling to different towns to do commissions. Favored painters were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3548\">Simon Flores y de la Rosa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3644\">Antonio Malantic</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3417\">Justiniano Asuncion</a>, Dionisio de Castro, and Ysidro Arceo, to mention a few. They worked in a style called <b>miniaturismo</b> derived from the miniaturist&rsquo;s art of limning, which gives meticulous attention to details of costume, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>, and textures to fashion accessories and jewelry, as well as domestic furnishings and various objets d&rsquo;arts. Among the outstanding portraits of the period were Simon Flores&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2281\"><b><i>Quiason Family</i></b></a>, 1880; Antonio Malantic&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2202\"><b><i>Inocencia</i></b></a> and <b><i><strong>Soledad</strong> Francia</i></b>, both done in 1876; Dionisio de Castro&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2299\"><b><i>Soterania Puson y Quintos de Ventenilla</i></b></a>, 1892; and Justiniano Asuncion&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2286\"><b><i>Romana <strong>Carillo</strong></i></b></a>, 1870. These images reflected a dynamic stage in the development of the Filipino identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Along with the secularization of art, painters opened their ateliers to students who wished to study art. Along with Faustino Quiotan, one of the earliest art teachers was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\">Damian Domingo</a> who founded the original Academia de Dibujo y Pintura (Academy of Drawing and Painting) around 1823. After his early death, however, it was taken over by the Sociedad Economica de Amigos del Pais (Economic Society of Friends of the Country) whose administration patterned it after the Academia de San Fernando (Academy of San Fernando) in Madrid and invited Spanish teachers Cortina and Nieto to teach. They were later followed by Agustin Saez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3741\">Lorenzo Rocha</a>. The academy had many students, among them <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3733\">Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</a>, along with several women artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of those who went to Spain, Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo, two expatriate artists, won honors at the Madrid Exposition of 1884. Luna was awarded the first gold medal for his <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong> </i> </b>and Hidalgo a silver for his<b>&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2319\">Las&nbsp;Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho</a></em></b> (Christian Virgins Exposed to the Crowd). Luna also painted <b><i>La Muerte de Cleopatra</i></b> (The Death of Cleopatra), which also won him a silver medal in the Madrid Exposition of 1881. Hidalgo is also known for other big canvases, like <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2130\"><i>El Asesinato del Gobernador Fernando Bustamante Y Su Hijo</i></a> </b>(The Assassination of Governor Fernando Bustamante and Son), done in the late 19th century, portraying a violent episode in 1719. Hidalgo painted the later capitulationist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2264\"><b><i>Per Pacem et Libertatem</i></b></a> (Through Peace and Liberty) in 1903. Triumphs of Luna and Hidalgo were inspirational to Filipinos who needed the affirmation that it was possible to surpass the colonial masters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Not long after, in 1896, the Philippine Revolution was launched against Spain. Symbols that were associated with the Katipunan and the struggles of the Filipino masses derived from indigenous images and syllabary. From this tradition came the reconfigured revolutionary Christ and Virgin Mary garbed in a Filipino dress of the Aglipayan church, which continue to be meaningful to various communities in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:3.0pt\"><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a></span></span></span><strong>The Visual Arts during the American Occupation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The gains of the Philippine Revolution of 1896 were thwarted by the United States (US) who crushed native resistance in the Philippine-American War, forcibly occupied the country, and established a colonial government. Colonial strategy lay primarily in the domain of ideology and culture. This was implemented through the public school system and educational programs. The colonial project included the participation of the Philippines in the Saint Louis World&rsquo;s Fair in 1904 in Missouri. At the fair, various indigenous groups were forced to perform their ethnicity as America&rsquo;s &ldquo;other.&rdquo; The colonized Filipinos became the subject of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a> seen through the lens of American soldiers, journalists, and anthropologists, constructing the image of the Filipino as an inferior race that needs American tutelage and benevolence. In the visual arts, there was a demand for illustrations and cartoons<b> </b>for the textbooks and publications of the period. To answer the needs of the new corporations, commercial art and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising<b> </b>design</a> were integrated into the fine arts curriculum. The Academia de Dibujo y Pintura was transformed into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">School of Fine Arts of the University of the Philippines</a>, one of the first units of the institution. The first director was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Don Fabian de la Rosa</a> who painted excellent country landscapes<b> </b>and genre scenes. He also continued the tradition of <b>tipos del pais </b>(country scenes), which consisted of a range of Filipino physical types, which were mainly academic exercises but with aesthetic value. The secretary of the college for a long period was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3416\">Jose Ma. Asuncion</a>, a member of the Asuncion family of artists. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> also became its directors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the American period, landscapes, genre paintings, and portraiture prevailed. Fernando Amorsolo, the foremost exponent of the school, painted colorful rural scenes characterized by backlighting, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2272\"><b><i>Planting Rice</i></b></a>, 1921, while in his portrait of <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2181\"><strong>Fernanda de Jesus</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1915, he upheld the paradigm of the <i>dalagang bukid</i> or country maiden with its conservative feudal values regarding women&rsquo;s role in society. Amorsolo landscapes and portraits were much sought-after by the elite, American officials, and tourists as these served as souvenirs of the colony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In sculpture, the dominant personality was Guillermo Tolentino who was trained in the classical tradition in Rome. He did a number of works such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><b><i>UP <strong><strong>Oblation</strong></strong></i></b></a>,<i> </i>1935,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Venus</i></b>, 1951, as well as numerous busts and life-size statues of public figures such as President Quezon. However, he is best known for the <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><strong>Bonifacio Monument</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1933,<b><i> </i></b>in Caloocan rotunda completed on the eve of the Commonwealth. Expressing nationalist fervor in the struggle against colonial rule, it was in consonance with the spirit of the period. Bonifacio, at the center of the storm, is surrounded by episodes or stages of the revolution from the execution of Fathers Jose Burgos, Jacinto Zamora, and Mariano Gomez, or the GomBurZa, to the uprising of the revolutionary Katipunan. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3461\">Anastacio Caedo</a>, an apprentice of Tolentino, followed this approach. Another sculptor of the period was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3655\">Ramon Martinez</a> who did the single-figure prototype sculpture of Bonifacio, one arm raising a bolo, originally meant for Balintawak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The dominance of Amorsolo was challenged by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a> who introduced modernism in the country. Fresh from the United States in 1928, Edades had an exhibit at the Philippine Columbian. Edades, an advocate of modern art, triggered a lively press debate between conservatives<b> </b>who followed Amorsolo and modernists who were drawn to his principles. Edades, whose influence lay primarily in his role as educator, stressed that the subject of art goes beyond the beautiful and harmonious to include the ugly and the terrible. He asserted the importance of design and formal elements underlying modern art. He also had the vision of developing Filipino identity in art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"japanese\" name=\"japanese\"></a>The Visual Arts during the Japanese Occupation </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippines under Japanese occupation experienced a cultural overhaul wherein all Western influences were abandoned. Paintings during this period showed conformity to Japanese mores. Works by Gregorio Sibug and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3522\">Vicente Alvarez Dizon</a>, for instance, highlighted Japanese policies while works by Fernando Amorsolo, Marcelino Rivera, Emilio Santiago, and Cirilo Santiago emphasized Filipino traditions and values. Cartoonists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3593\">EZ Izon</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3568\">Liborio Gatbonton</a> worked for the Japanese-censored <b><i><strong>Tribu</strong>ne</i></b>, highlighting government policies and projects. Connoisseurs and patrons such as Jorge Vargas, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5036\">Aurelio Alvero</a>, and Jose Bantug continued to support the arts. Art criticism<b> </b>was kept alive as evidenced by critical exchanges between art critics. Many artists found ways to eke out a living during this difficult time. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a> worked for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>, designing billboards, sets, and posters for stage plays. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3745\">Manuel Rodriguez Sr</a> opened an art school in Naga and later made and sold brooches, fans, and bakya in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While Filipino artists had no choice but to acquiesce, they also managed to resist Japanese rule. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>did underground work for the US Army Forces in the Far East and Izon illustrated for the Japanese underground paper <b><i>The Liberator</i></b>. Subtle messages of subversion were also incorporated in the works of Izon and Gatbonton in the <b><i>Tribune</i></b>. But it was only after the war ended that artists were able to give free rein to their emotions by depicting Japanese atrocities in their works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"republic3\" name=\"republic3\"></a>Republic III: 1946-72</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The uncertainty and the unrest resulting from the war were harnessed by modernists using techniques of distortion. Modernists and conservatives thwarted content and any moral or utilitarian function during the disruptive aftermath, a period wherein form and self-expression prevailed. In addition, after the granting of formal independence by the United States of America and while Manila was still in ruins, the question of national identity was posed by writers and artists. In fact, the first impetus to modernism was coupled with the quest for identity, which artists dealt with in various ways: through subject matter,<b> </b>content,<b> </b>and<b> </b>form.<b> </b>Along with this issue was the debate between proletarian art and art for art&rsquo;s sake, which emerged with the widespread poverty of the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modern painting grew with the Triumvirate formed by Victorio Edades, Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco, and Galo B. Ocampo who in 1930 collaborated on commissioned murals for the State and Capitol Theaters, in which the public was first exposed to modern art with an Art Deco influence. Meanwhile press debates on conservatism versus modernism were resumed after the war. In painting, Edades demonstrated his modernist style primarily in <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2156\"><strong>The Builders</strong></a></strong> </i></b>and <b><i>The Artist and His Model</i></b>, both dated 1928.<b> </b>Angono-based Francisco did the magnificent historical mural <b><i>500 Years of Philippine History</i></b>, the first of its kind, for the 1953 Manila International Fair. This was followed in 1969 by the <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2182\"><i>History of the Struggles of the Filipino People</i></a> </b>for the Bulwagang Katipunan of the Manila City Hall during the time of Mayor Antonio Villegas. The second mural is divided into the various episodes of Philippine history and its central figures. Carlos Francisco also did many genre murals celebrating Filipino customs and festivals in his style of fluid curvilinear lines, graceful figures, and tropical colors. He drew most of his subjects from the life of his lakeshore town, and gave to genre painting a rich particularity of detail of the customs, traditions, and material culture of fishermen and farmers. Galo B. Ocampo is best remembered for his <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2154\"><strong>Brown Madonna</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<i> </i>1938, giving the traditional religious subject a Filipino iconography, and for his painting series Ecce Homo, 1950, alluding to the war. A later series was the Tabon Man,<b><i> </i></b>1970s,<b><i> </i></b>an homage to the earliest human fossil found in the Philippines, as well as to the primeval roots of the Filipino people&rsquo;s ancestors.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also after the war, the Thirteen Moderns pursued the campaign for modernism and constituted a new generation after the Amorsolo School. Merged with the original Triumvirate were the names of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3464\">Arsenio Capili</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3487\">Bonifacio Cristobal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3631\">Diosdado M. Lorenzo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3640\">Anita Magsaysay-Ho</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3686\">H.R. Ocampo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3703\">Jose Pardo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\">Ricarte Puruganan</a>. There was an earlier effort to organize under the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3420\">Atelier of Modern Art</a> headed by Diosdado M. Lorenzo with Victorio Edades and Carlos Francisco but World War II disrupted the initiative. Other noted abstract artists during this period were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3789\">Romeo Tabuena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3391\">Federico Alcuaz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3445\">Constancio Bernardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\">Arturo Luz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3738\">Cenon Rivera</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3696\">Victor Oteyza</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The support system for modern art was laid down with the founding of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3604\">Purita Kalaw-Ledesma</a>. It began a highly successful annual art competition, which welcomed modernist as well as conservative artists. Complementing the AAP was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3716\">Philippine Art Gallery</a> founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3414\">Lydia Villanueva-Arguilla</a>. As the pioneering gallery, it provided a venue for fledgling modernists and curated the first shows. A third important venue was the Contemporary Art Gallery founded and run by Manuel Rodriguez Sr, which specialized in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a> and offered continual workshops to disseminate the art form. The tension between the conservatives and modernists came to a head in 1959 during the semiannual art competition sponsored by the Art Association of the Philippines. The conservatives staged a walkout to protest the perceived bias of the jury who awarded most of the prizes to the modernists. The conservatives set up the Mabini Artists group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the main protagonists in painting were Amorsolo and Edades, in sculpture it was Tolentino and his pupil <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>. The latter championed modernist values in sculpture while striving for a Filipino idiom. Abueva has worked with a wide variety of materials and techniques, although his personal preference is wood, mainly narra and molave, carved directly by chisel. He has also worked with adobe and alabaster, different kinds of metal (brass, bronze, and aluminum), as well as concrete. Abueva&rsquo;s work is characterized by playfulness and charming wit, often integrating sculptural and functional aspects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Popular art<b> </b>was also alive during this period with <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">komiks</a> </b>continuing to gain ground, especially among the masses, because of its visuality, affordability, and availability. The humorous, historical, and fantasy themes of komiks in the postwar period provided a convenient escape from the harsh realities of life. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3477\">Francisco Coching</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2200\"><strong>El Indio</strong></a></strong></i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\">Mars Ravelo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong> </i></b> exemplify these themes.<i> </i>It was also an active period for journalism, with the major dailies churning out creative and original editorial cartoons by artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\">Larry Alcala</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\">Malang</a>, and Corky Trinidad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1950s, a number of artists formed a subgroup called the Neo-Realists consisting of Vicente Manansala, H.R. Ocampo, and Cesar Legaspi. Influenced by <b>cubism</b>, they sought to explore modernist styles of approaching the figure. They arrived at the style called <b>transparent cubism</b>, which fused the cubist structuring of the figure with transparent effects, resulting in the indigenization of the original School of Paris style. It is often observed that, unlike European cubism which fragmented the human form, the cubism of the Neo-Realists did more than cut up forms&mdash;they reorganized them into facets or transparent planes. One artist who showed cubist influence was Federico Aguilar<strong> </strong>Alcuaz who spent many years in Europe, where he designed abstract tapestries.<b> </b>Vicente Manansala expanded the subject matter of art, culling inspiration from the rural idylls of the Amorsolo School to the postwar urban realities of jeepneys recycled from the war, candle and amulet vendors in Quiapo (which was the hub of economic struggle), to the patchwork <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\"><i>barong-barong</i></a> (shanties) in Manila, which appeared following postwar displacement and poverty. H.R. Ocampo worked on proletarian art showing the poor and the stark social contrasts in the urban setting. One of the important works to come out of the period, <b><i>Calvary</i></b>, 1948, shows Christ on the cross, flanked by the two thieves against a background of factories spewing forth noxious orange fumes. He subsequently moved away from social themes and sought to develop a Filipino abstract idiom. Later, he became widely known for an abstract style of interlocking colored planes, as in his <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1969, curtain design for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>. Cesar Legaspi traversed different periods in his works during the development of his modernist idiom. Legaspi created proletarian art with his painting <b><i>The Beggars</i></b> (also titled <b><i><strong><strong>The Kiss</strong></strong></i></b>), 1945, showing two wretched figures huddled among the ruins in monochrome brown with cubist fragmentation. Later works drew their imagery from stone quarries and carved tribal icons in the search for basic origins. After experimental works in sculptured surfaces, Legaspi explored rhythmic figures in richly orchestrated tones and colors. Later, he painted the dynamic Jeepney<b><i> </i></b>series with suggestions of street graffiti in neorealist style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another neorealist, Romeo Tabuena was known for delicate watercolors of the rural scene. Subjects consisted mainly of rice fields with carabaos and nipa huts in an early morning haze as though forms are emerging from the mist&mdash;a style that combined exquisite linearity with tonal effects. But he also worked in an intense, vigorous style in dark tones and harsh, bold strokes diametrically different from the first, and in which he depicted sun-shriveled peasants and gnarled workers. This was also an active period for Anita Magsaysay-Ho displaying a distinct genre of etherealized female peasants in various rural activities. But she had earlier worked in a more vigorous style influenced by the New York School of the 1950s and its association with the painterly abstract expressionism. She also went through a nocturnal period of women selling their wares, primarily birds in cages as though etched in the darkness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A branch of modernism was <b>abstract art</b>, the major proponents of which in the 1950s were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\">Jose Joya</a> and Constancio Bernardo. Joya was strongly influenced by New York abstract expressionism. Federico Aguilar Alcuaz alternated between abstract and figurative painting in many landscapes done during sojourns abroad and charming genre scenes of women. <b><i>Carnival Forms</i></b>, 1956, by Arturo Luz showed greater texture and density but retained a linear character. Next, Luz approached his work with burlap collages and calligraphic works on handmade paper. He was also known for his sculptures ranging from large outdoor works to small silver pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1960s was characterized by the rise of second-generation abstractionists Jose Joya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3380\">Lee Aguinaldo</a>, Mauro Malang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\">Ang Kiukok</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3625\">Veronica Yu</a>, and younger artists using different styles like Ben Cabrera (aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\">BenCab</a>), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3422\">Antonio Austria</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3442\">Norma Belleza</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3684\">Justin Nuyda</a>. In the field of sculpture, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\">J. Elizalde Navarro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3523\">Edgar Doctor</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\">David Medalla</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3469\">Eduardo Castrillo</a> caught the public&rsquo;s attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Cultural Center of the Philippines was opened in 1969 as the most visible symbol of state patronage. Under Roberto Chabet and later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3385\">Raymundo Albano</a>, the CCP opened its exhibition programming to works influenced by Western avant-garde and conceptual tenets. Chabet initiated and maintained an experimental and conceptual approach with a valorization of materials and their semiotic potentials. Aguinaldo kept in close touch with art trends in the United States, churning out works that called to mind the &ldquo;zip&rdquo; paintings of Barnett Newman. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3740\">Alfredo Roces</a>, known for figurative landscapes and still lifes, maintained a highly personal and original approach to his art. At the heels of the first-generation modernists followed a more audacious, younger breed. Ang Kiukok, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3693\">Onib Olmedo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3507\">Jaime de Guzman</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\">Danilo Dalena</a> worked in expressionist styles with high visual impact. In contrast, BenCab developed a highly original idiom that combined realism with experimental devices to enrich the significations of the artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the climate of the Cold War, the nuclear threat, and American aggression in Vietnam, Ang Kiukok crystallized in vivid, cubist figures the terror and angst of the times. Ang Kiukok figures were strongly structured and concentrated in composition, often symbolic in content, with contrasting hues that conveyed emotional conflict. Jaime de Guzman painted historical murals of the 19th-century propaganda movement and revolution against Spain in a painterly, expressionistic style. Gifted with a sense of locale, he also celebrated Mount Banahaw, home to many folk cults, in paintings with indigenous symbols. Another strong artistic personality who lent brilliance to the 1960s was Danilo Dalena. A political cartoonist, he is known for paintings of large crowds of people in quest of luck or miracles and of unflinchingly realist character studies and drawings of the steamy side of the city. It was primarily Dalena who carried on the tradition in popular forms begun in the 1960s and resumed in the 1970s by the modernists. Ben Cabrera, in his low-key but intellectually experimental style, explored images of the Filipino in prints and watercolors inspired by turn-of-the-century photographs that he analyzed, drawing out a rich semiotic vocabulary with which he made subtle, ironic comments on the colonial relationship and the question of national identity. Another contemporary, Onib Olmedo portrayed the down-and-out, the street hawkers, and nocturnal denizens with the use of expressionist distortion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"republic4\" name=\"republic4\"></a>Republic IV: 1972-86</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Escalating mass protests against the worsening economic crisis led to the First Quarter Storm of 1970. The US-supported Marcos government responded to the highly charged political climate by declaring martial law in 1972 and establishing a conjugal dictatorship. Most of the artists who emerged in the 1960s continued to produce important work in the 1970s through the martial law years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In assessing the social and political situation, a number of artists maintained the importance of an art responsible to society and to the issues and concerns of the times. The social realists who grouped together in the 1970s were not an entirely new force since they firmed up the postwar direction in &ldquo;proletarian art&rdquo; and expanded the nationalist themes of older artists like Cesar Legaspi and Hernando Ocampo. To the Kaisahan (Solidarity) social realist group belonged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3764\">Pablo Baens Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3543\">Edgar Talusan Fernandez</a>, Papo de Asis, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3468\">Orlando Castillo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3519\">Antipas Delotavo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3577\">Renato Habulan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3524\">Neil Doloricon</a>, Al Manrique, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\">Jose Tence Ruiz</a>. Aside from them, there were other serious artists who produced or continued to produce significant works of social consciousness. A work that exemplified the period is Delotavo&rsquo;s <b><i>Itak sa Puso ni Mang Juan</i></b> (Knife in Juan&rsquo;s Heart), 1978, depicting a downtrodden Filipino worker oppressed by the economic tyranny of multinational corporations in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the same time, numerous artists were caught up in active state patronage of the arts and in the state-sponsored building boom, which resulted in a lucrative partnership between interior designers and artists. For one, the martial law years were marked by a high degree of tourism consciousness. The CCP Complex was part of the building boom, which began in 1969. Mrs Marcos used the CCP to project the image of the state as benevolent patron of the arts and to support state cultural ideology. Genre paintings flourished in this decade with highly original approaches seen in the work of Norma Belleza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3402\">Angelito Antonio</a>, Antonio Austria, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3704\">Mario Parial</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3432\">Manuel Baldemor</a>, and Mauro Malang Santos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paintings also conveyed a genuine feeling for the city folk with their small trades and modest pastimes, as in the subject of vendors and cockfighters popularized by Manansala, as well as folk traditions. There was an evident self-confidence and zest on the part of the artists in breaking away from the academic conventions and creating new figurative styles more suitable to their folk subjects. A particular group represented the trend in &ldquo;vanishing scene&rdquo; paintings, which rendered old churches, landmarks, and ancestral houses in meticulous detail. This kind of painting with an underlying documentary impulse was pursued by Al Perez and Elmer Gernale. While Lino Severino, a painter, was one of the first to do this type of work, he did not only render material appearance but also captured the mood and atmosphere of old crumbling structures, especially turn-of-the-century houses, by means of fine tonalities in monochrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abstract art continued primarily with the influence of Jose Joya, who had earlier caused a stir with bold paintings in the abstract expressionist style driven by kinetic impulse, as in<b> <i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2197\"><strong>Hills of Nikko</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b> </b>1964.<b> </b>Later, he moved to a more harmonious idiom in acrylic and rice paper collages that played on transparent and overlapping colored forms in space. Artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3611\">Lao Lianben</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3387\">Augusto Albor</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3553\">Mars Galang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3440\">Glenn Bautista</a>, Justin Nuyda, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3820\">Phillip Victor</a> also worked in developing their own abstract idioms. Albor opted for a minimalist abstraction in black and white, using a variety of materials including reflecting surfaces. Lao Lianben worked in wood with relief elements and found objects, at times singed and scratched, in contrasting black and white. Zen was an abiding influence in his work, which is based on a few significant signs. Phillip Victor developed a new medium of white-embossed paintings with nature symbols and small color accents in abstract landscapes recalling the fish ponds of his native Bulacan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of artists took up the ethnic theme, following the example of Muslim painter and sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\">Abdulmari Imao</a>. His themes were inspired by the life and culture of the fishing villages of Sulu and Lanao in Mindanao. He is best known for his series on the <i>sarimanok</i>, a principal cultural symbol derived from the ancient legends of Mindanao and Sulu. He introduced innovations in brassware among the craftsmen of Tugaya, Lanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Continuing from the 1960s, Manuel Rodriguez Sr&rsquo;s printmaking workshop at the Contemporary Art Gallery promoted the development of graphic arts. Another senior printmaker was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3702\">Rodolfo Paras-Perez</a> who produced an outstanding series of woodcuts of expressionist influence. Soon, members of the Philippine Association of Printmakers were producing works in etching and aquatint, collographs, embossments, and woodcuts. Among the artists who trained in the workshops were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\">Virgilio Aviado</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3462\">Imelda Cajipe-Endaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\">Brenda Fajardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3569\">Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3718\">Impy Pilapil</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3518\">Fil Delacruz</a>. Aviado&rsquo;s style ranged from highly detailed surrealist compositions to minimal constructions of paper collage. Imelda Cajipe-Endaya has explored the question of national identity in etching and serigraphy.<b> </b>Brenda Fajardo&rsquo;s prints at first showed the influence of classical figuration before she shifted to folk forms of representation, such as tarot figures. Based in Paris, Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi worked in the color viscosity printing technique, which makes possible simultaneous printing in different colors. She has also dealt with the question of Filipino identity and the threat of nuclear devastation in the Cold War. Impy Pilapil did cosmic landscapes in serigraphy, sometimes using origami-like elements. A printmaker who revived the mezzotint technique is Fil Delacruz who did works inspired by his sojourn among the tribal Filipino groups in Mindanao. He favored mezzotint for its wider and finer range of black-and-white tones that convey mood and atmosphere. These printmakers developed Philippine themes, drawing inspiration from indigenous and folk culture, as well as making comment on contemporary realities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of sculptors also emerged in the same productive decade. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3580\">Lamberto Hechanova</a> innovated in the use of metal and plastics in sculpture. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3807\">Virginia Ty-Navarro</a> worked in new techniques in wood with an in-carved intaglio method also done in metal with a pointillist<b> </b>approach, using beads of molten metal to shape figures on a basic framework. J. Elizalde Navarro pioneered in highly expressive wood and metal <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblages</a>.<b> </b>Ty-Navarro was also known for her metal sculptures of birdds.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3818\">Francisco Verano</a> was among the first to use bamboo in sculpture, as in his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2140\"><b><i><strong>Bamboo</strong> Fugue</i></b></a> in the CCP. Eduardo Castrillo produced a sizeable body of work, including monumental sculptures of religious themes for memorial parks, large open-form abstracts of welded metal, mobiles and modular pieces in chrome and plexiglass, metal relief sculptures of social themes, and sculptured body jewelry. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3767\">Solomon Saprid</a> created metal sculptures around the theme of the <i>tikbalang</i>, a mythological &ldquo;half-human half-horse&rdquo; creature. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3694\">Ramon Orlina</a> who trained in architecture developed glass sculpture in freestanding works or as elements of architectural design. Printmaker Impy Pilapil transposed her earlier themes to glass etching, which she combined with rocks for contrasting texture and three-dimensional form. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3629\">Julie Lluch</a> has consistently pursued her art with personal expressionist works and accomplishments in portraiture in the terra-cotta medium. Other sculptors who deserve mention are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3540\">Noel El Farol</a> who works in glass and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3620\">Gerry Leonardo</a> who works in resin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The large-scale anger that followed the assassination of former senator Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr in 1983 saw the proliferation of street rallies. Continuing through to and particularly evident during the post-Marcos period, <strong>p</strong><b>rotest art</b> in the form of murals and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2099\">effigies</a><b> </b>became the means to express dissatisfaction with the political situation. Underground publications also used the graphic arts to explain social and political issues, not just as protest to the Marcos dictatorship but to advance a revolutionary struggle to change the social conditions of Philippine society itself. Artists who worked for various causes at this time would plant the seeds of regional art groups and alternative ways of practicing art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"republic5\" name=\"republic5\"></a>Republic V: 1986 Onward</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The mid-1980s saw major upheavals in Philippine sociopolitical life. The 1986 EDSA Revolt that overthrew President Ferdinand Marcos and his dictatorial regime built high hopes for changes in governance and the realization of artistic freedom. This resulted in a reorientation of vision, mission, and goals of cultural institutions, such as the Cultural Center of the Philippines, to promote democratization and decentralization of creativity and art management in the country. In 1992, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> was created to address these issues as well as implement the National Artist Awards and the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan. An important development in this period is a growing recognition of the range of art forms that broadened the definition of the visual arts. Rather than being limited to two-dimensional and three-dimensional art forms, the visual arts now include video work, sound, performance, and the participatory experience, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\"><b>video art</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2117\"><b>sound</b> <b>art</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\"><b>performance</b> <b>art</b></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\"><b>installation</b> <b>art</b></a>, and <b>site-specific art</b>.<b> </b>Reflecting the rise of installation art was the First Bagasbas International Eco-Arts Festival held in Bagasbas in Daet, Camarines Norte, 2008, arguably prequeled by Siteworks in UP Los Ba&ntilde;os, Laguna three decades prior. Interestingly, both site projects consisted mainly of locally sourced materials. In Bagasbas, it consisted mainly of bamboo constructions along the beach which interacted, through the artists&rsquo; creativity, with the entire environment of land and sea. Participating artists in the first edition were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3750\">Ronaldo Ruiz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3404\">Alfredo Juan Aquilizan</a>, Henri Cainglet, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3581\">Hermisanto</a>, Edille Paras, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3705\">Diokno Pasilan</a>, and Tony&nbsp;Twigg.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Curatorial practice expanded with artist-curators working with alternative spaces for exhibitions rather than in traditional museums and galleries. Artworks were increasingly embedded in urban and community spaces, and public festival sites while also becoming more frequently upheld as commodities in market venues like auctions and art fairs. Meanwhile, regional art groups as well as urban artist formations, which advocated a definition of art that serves the needs of their communities, also flourished. Responding to various issues of poverty, environmental degradation, social inequities, and continuing struggle for human rights, these groups formed collectives and networks to create art platforms rather than art shows. This is exemplified by the activities of the now defunct <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3449\">Black Artists in Asia</a> of Negros, whose members included&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3474\">Charlie Co</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3394\">Nunelucio Alvarado</a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\">Baguio Arts Guild</a>, whose members included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\">Santiago Bose</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3824\">Roberto Villanueva</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3751\">John Frank Sabado</a>, and BenCab. Spaces for art would open up such as in the exhibits of the Silangan Foundation for the Arts, Culture and Ecology, based in Antipolo, which showcased a diversely aligned set of then emerging artists such as Salvador Alonday, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3452\">Elmer Borlongan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3566\">Emmanuel Garibay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3603\">Mark Justiniani</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3614\">Antonio Lea&ntilde;o</a>, and Jose Santos III.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Women artists during this period redefined art production and reception through the group<i> </i>Kababaihan sa Bagong Sining at Bagong Sibol na Kamalayan (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3605\">Kasibulan</a>), founded in 1989. Imelda Cajipe-Endaya, Ofelia Galvezon-Tequi, Brenda Fajardo, Julie Lluch, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3591\">Lydia Ingle</a>, and many others challenged male-centered narratives by bringing to the fore women&rsquo;s lives and experiences as part of political discourse. Highlighting the global network for the advocacy of women&rsquo;s voices, the exhibit <b><i>Trauma Interrupted</i></b>, 2007, held at the CCP, gathered several artists from different countries to present works in which women both evoked and worked out their experiences of oppression brought on by war and patriarchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2005, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3547\">Karen Flores</a> and Manny Garibay organized a series of Tutok shows, such as <b><i>Tutok: Kasaysayan </i></b>(Focus: History) dealing with historical issues. Its earlier project was <b><i>Tutok: Karapatan </i></b>(Focus: Human Rights), which tackled the extrajudicial killings of journalists and progressive community leaders. Following its success, the artist-organizers under the aegis of the Constantino Foundation continued on with the advocacy work of the Tutok<b> </b>series, which, like the first, brought together young and mid-career artists to harness their art&#39;s potency in popular education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The millennium years have been witness to a dynamic reconfiguration of artistic energies, influenced by a boom in the art market and the heady auctions in Hong Kong and Singapore. Art competitions sponsored by big corporations and banks, such as Shell, Petron, Metrobank, and the Philippine Art Awards (Philip Morris Group of Companies), developed mechanisms that recognized new and young talents and rewarded the accomplishment of elders. The participation of Filipino artists in international biennales and triennales as well as the upsurge in the global trafficking of art commercially also affected the international circulation of Philippine art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists are now more thoughtfully exploring the theme of national identity, mining and transforming materials and themes. Santiago Bose&rsquo;s <i>anting-anting </i>trope, for instance,&nbsp;brings out these political tensions not only in terms of the imagery but in the active approach to enable meaning through working with the material and ground, which is molded, scarified, gouged, fired, layered, and variously distressed with scratches, erasures, scribbles, and burns in a highly material kind of semiotics. Consistently the major proponents of the use of indigenous materials in their work are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3371\">Paz Abad Santos</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\">Junyee</a>, although Abad Santos has also geared her art to therapy in her work on color recognition for the blind. Another artist, the late <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3370\">Pacita Abad</a>, excelled in trapunto through which she created a prodigious body of fabric art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The search and desire for creative material has led artists to probe both site and history.&nbsp;Still another parallel practice is that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3731\">Alwin Reamillo</a>&nbsp;who conceptualized and realized the installation <b><i>Mang Emo + Mag-himo Grand Piano Project</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>2007, featuring assemblage-composites of an upright piano and a grand piano in two spaces, CCP and Galleria Duemila, complete with performances by musicians. Its background is supported by the artist&rsquo;s family roots in the piano-making industry in the Philippines. Another artist doing work in this vein is Lirio Salvador who is known for creating hybrid musical instruments that are unlike any that have been seen previously. These objects can surprisingly be played in a band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The themes of figurative artworks during this period range from questions of identity in the global world, power relations, postcolonial interpretation of history, and the value of local knowledge in art. Nunelucio Alvarado, based in Bacolod, consistently evokes such themes and excels in the emblematic potential of his large murals, as exemplified in <b><i>Duta Inde Bala</i></b> (Land Not Bullets), which fuses religious imagery and revolutionary struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The itinerant Manuel Ocampo&rsquo;s early&nbsp;paintings deal with clashes of culture in colonial and multicultural contexts, especially between the dominant West and the indigenous colonized cultures, and the human suffering that ensued from such encounters. They also allude to the 20th-century holocausts, and the dictatorships that swept the globe, as well as hardbound prejudices of race and gender. This turmoil is conveyed with the use of recurrent Western and Philippine symbols.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Manny Garibay, meanwhile, interrogates the traditional identity of God and replaces it with multiple identities: as woman, as derelict, as abandoned street child. In his works, there is a constant shifting of genders, man/woman and vice versa, as well as the surprising appearance of Christ in various guises. Another peer, Elmer Borlongan, is an artist who pursues an original vision that derives from the everyday life of ordinary people. He gives his subjects a mystical dimension that makes them stand out, suggesting a strength of will that can overcome the dreary and desperate conditions of their lives. Mark Justiniani in turn has weighed in on America&rsquo;s 9/11 event that shifted the political temper of international security in 21st century. Based on the artist&rsquo;s personal recounting, it ironically took a long-distance call from the Philippines to relay a wake-up message about the fiery devastation in the heart of New York. Avoiding a grim approach, the artist brings to his work on the subject a surrealist seriocomic touch. For on the crumpled bed lies a grunting, half-yawning half-shrieking humanoid jolted from sleep, the bedside TV turned on by remote control and unfolding the gut-wrenching catastrophe on an otherwise uneventful morning. Among Filipino artists, it is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3536\">Alfredo Esquillo</a> who has given close scrutiny to the subject of folk religiosity. He has discovered that the folk mind is captive to a powerful triad: folk Christianity centering on the Passion of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2146\">Nazarene</a>, the TV media, and sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The present barrage of media and sensory triggers have also enabled artists to bring in an abject performative mode to their work. An occasion in which Filipino artists shone before a foreign audience was the participation of the local group New World Disorder in the theater festival Trilogy of Globalization held in Hamburg, Germany, 2004. Stark visual contrasts also played an important part in one&nbsp;performance-installation-video of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3491\">Mideo Cruz</a>: antiseptic white walls and furniture against bloody red, sharp edges against chaos, bourgeois authority against squalid effusion, human against animal, one against many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The interactive impulse brought on by networking technology has further heightened artists&rsquo; willingness to collaborate, though this propensity itself has underpinned analog methods such as painting. The mural <b><i>Crossroads of the Filipino People</i></b>, 2007, is the collective work of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3680\">Neo-Angono Artists Collective</a> including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3805\">Rommel &ldquo;Wire&rdquo; Tuazon</a>, Richard Gappi, Katrina Miranda-Tuason, Michael de Guzman, and Allan G. Alcantara, a number of them fine arts graduates of the University of the Philippines. Relevant to the times, this National Press Club-commissioned mural dealt with the theme of the history of press freedom from the 19th century to the present, but this ironically became the subject of censorship. The CCP issued a statement commending the Neo-Angono Artists Collective for standing up for their rights, and enjoined the rest of the artistic community to do the same. Ironically, CCP became embroiled in another controversy concerning the closure of the exhibit <b><i>Kulo </i></b>(Boil), 2011, because of a contested installation work, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2273\"><strong>Poleteismo</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Polytheism), 2011, by Mideo Cruz. This incorporated an image of male genitalia on a Christian cross. Issues on the freedom of expression were compounded by the loud protest that came from the Catholic Church and the role of media and politicians in defining art based on diverging interests. Artists have gone through many exciting events, discoveries, and challenges that affect the production, circulation, and reception of art. While artists continue to respond to contemporary material conditions and global issues that affect the lives of all, the need for a discerning gaze and nuanced understanding of art is necessary for an integrated reading and retelling of the Filipino peoples&rsquo; multivocal stories at various periods of their collective history. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

Through the creative and imaginative use of <a href=\"/3/16/2121\">materials</a>, various art forms have developed as a response to existing social, cultural, economic, and political conditions of an era. Whichever manner the parcel of history is expressed, the visual art forms in every historical period reflect the triumphs and struggles of the time.

Art production focuses on the material, technique, and social forces that have influenced the creativity of the artists; the circulation of art points to various ways an art form can be disseminated in society, while reception implies the importance of audience, perceiver, and users of these art forms.

This is shown in the similarity of languages, lifeways, and art forms that have been unearthed through archaeological methods, exhibiting the integration of art in everyday life as well as in belief systems that art relates to. These art forms drew their origins from the indigenous cosmologies of the universe, from the rituals for fertility and abundant harvest, which ensured the survival of the human race."

These art forms and processes in the indigenous art traditions are characterized by the following: use of materials found in the immediate environment; valuation of handmade processes and localized technology; functional use in everyday life; and aesthetic connection with the traditional belief systems that are based on the physical environment. These art forms are also considered living traditions and are invariably related to other art expressions, both material and performative, within a specific locality and ethnicity. Therefore, as living traditions, the indigenous or local knowledge systems are an important component in its valuation in Philippine art as these become the vessel that represents the unique identities of Philippine culture."

The<i> </i><a href=\"/3/82/2227\">Manunggul jar</a> excavated in Palawan is evidence of the high artistic level that the early Filipinos attained in ancient times. This large burial jar has a lid that features two men rowing in a boat, suggesting the belief of the early Filipinos in an afterlife that the departed reaches after crossing a body of water. Around its body are incised geometric patterns of scallops and dots. Another outstanding example is the<b><i> </i></b><a href=\"/3/82/2158\">Calatagan jar</a><b><i> </i></b>whose body contains inscriptions, which have gone through a process of deciphering. Scholars have documented examples of early Philippine pottery showing a wide variety of shapes and decorative techniques, such as incision, stippling, appliqu&#xE9;, openwork, and design impressions by rope and mat, usually geometric with stylized nature motifs.

In the Ilocos, the tradition of <b>burnay </b>pottery is much appreciated by pottery connoisseurs of the region. Many parts of the country continue their lively wood carving traditions up to the present day."

				"value": "The Cordillera groups carve <b>anito</b> figures called <b>bulol</b>, which double as ancestral spirits and granary gods. They are often found in male and female pairs to signify the value of fertility. Also integrated into parts of houses, such as door posts, as well as in household articles such as bowls, forks and spoons, and other objects for dining, are human and animal wood carving motifs like the <b>tat-tagu</b>. In the South, the <a href=\"/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> and the <a href=\"/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> of Mindanao and Sulu are widely known for their <b>okir</b>, ornate curvilinear designs and motifs primarily applied to wood carving. The principal okir designs are the <b>sarimanok</b>, the <b>naga</b>, and the <b>pako rabong</b>. The sarimanok, carved in wood, varnished or painted in many colors (it is also executed in brass), is the stylized design of a bird, a kingfisher, holding a fish in its beak or standing on a base in the shape of a fish. While its meaning derives from <a href=\"/9/73/1549\">epics</a> and myths, it also alludes to Lake Lanao with its fertile waters. The naga has the form of an elaborate, mythical serpent with a distinct S-curve and numerous curvilinear motifs to suggest its scales. The pako rabong is a stylized growing fern with a broad base gracefully tapering upward in many levels. The sarimanok and naga are found as design ornaments of the <i>panolong</i>, the extended floor beam of the <a href=\"/2/5/229\"><i>torogan</i></a> or the large sultan&#x2019;s house, as well as in its interior beams and posts. The <a href=\"/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> of Palawan carve wooden figures in the shape of different kinds of birds. Again, meanings are linked to religion and ritual, for birds play an important part in Tagbanwa mythology as messengers that link the many levels of the celestial realm. The animals and other creatures, such as the pig and wild boar, have a part in ritual as sacrificial offerings. These carvings are of blackened wood, incised with geometric designs that expose the original light tone of the wood. It also goes without saying that these carved creations also serve the social function of toys for children to play with."

By means of the backstrap loom, produced are blankets and articles of clothing that not only fulfill a practical function but also play a part in religion and ritual. This tradition spills over into the adjacent Ilocos provinces, particularly the <b>abel</b> weave. In Mindanao, the <a href=\"/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> of Cotabato weave abaca cloth called<b> tnalak</b> using a difficult tie-dye process in a decorative dyeing technique. The cloth has a large repertoire of motifs, such as the <b>g&#x2019;mayaw</b> bird, created with the sense of flapping wings; the frog, which signifies fertility; and the dancing man, which calls for rain. These motifs attest to the Tboli&#x2019;s deep-seated sense of harmony between human beings and nature, expressed in song and dance."

				"value": "Different <a href=\"/3/15/2106\">weaving</a> techniques are also used in the exquisite mats with vivid hues and intricate geometric designs done by the women of Sulu, particularly from the islands of Laminusa and Siasi. In the Visayas, Samar and Leyte are also known for their colorful mats with bird and flower designs. The large mat meant for family use implies strong familial values, at the same time reflecting the environment and even historical change. A favorite mat design in these parts is the long San Juanico Bridge, which has made travel between the provinces easier. The making of hats, <a href=\"/3/15/2096\">baskets</a>, and fans also use weaving techniques in materials such as rattan, buri, and nito. The Cordilleras are rich in baskets for all purposes, reflecting occupational needs related to rice planting on the mountain terraces, hunting in the forests, and fishing in the streams. The backpack called<b> pasiking</b>,<b> </b>for instance, is not only an example of good design but of efficient structure made to support the human frame. Aside from baskets and containers related to hunting and agricultural activities, there are also many kinds of bamboo fish traps with shapes and sizes to suit the different species of fish and crustaceans found in the rivers. Other more urbanized parts of the country excel in hat weaving. The Southern <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> region specializes in making fine buntal hats made of buri, which are on display during the fiestas of Lucban and Sariaya in Quezon Province."

Later they assumed a purely ornamental character. The Cordillera groups have an ancient amulet design called the lingling-o, said to signify fertility, widely found in necklaces, rings, and earrings. In Southern Philippines, the Tboli create some of the most splendid body ornaments in brass chains and bells, strings and nets of multicolored beads, fine chains of horsehair neckpieces, earrings, rings, bracelets, and anklets. Related to religious belief and to social function, body ornaments<b> </b>are worn to please the gods, signify the status of the wearer, and enhance the wearer&#x2019;s physical charms. A belt made of a row of brass bells that tinkle with every movement calls attention to the approach of a young nubile girl. At times, body jewelry is worn along with elaborate tattoos on the body, especially around the arms and legs, which function as an indelible design with motifs from nature related to the animist worldview. The <b>anting-anting</b> or medals with mystical symbols and figures in relief are worn by the folk as amulets rather than as simply body ornaments."

The Tboli make lively brass figurines as a narrative form of <a href=\"/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>, which depicts occupations and activities, work and play, apart from any practical function. The Maranao community of Tugaya around Lake Lanao specializes in making exquisite brass bowls and vessels of all kinds and shapes ornamented with delicate incisions and highlighted with gold and silver designs, which are used in ceremonial functions and serve as household status symbols. Among these are the large <b>gadur</b> and the spouted liquid container called <b>kendi</b>, both of which often form part of the wedding dowry. Again, these vessels combine practical function with aesthetic design, as seen in their elaborate geometric and curvilinear motifs. Also noteworthy is the variety of betel-nut boxes in metal, wood, or bamboo produced by many ethnic groups, attesting to the widespread social custom of betel chewing often referred to in the epics still extant among some Philippine groups."

Art became a handmaiden of religion and served to propagate Christianity by means of beautiful images that appealed to the emotions while they supported the colonial order. Since the Church was the sole patron of the arts up to the end of the 18th century, the practice of art was under the strict supervision of the friars, and Western models were provided for artists to emulate. In time, what resulted, however, was not a Western culture but a colonial culture marked by a fusion of folk indigenous and Western elements. Despite the efforts of the colonizers to suppress the local culture, the imposed Western model eventually fused with indigenous elements, resulting in syncretic art."

Classical santos followed the prescribed proportions for the figure and conveyed the values of restraint and cool elegance, while those showing baroque influence, whether in wood or in ivory, had an emotional, expressionistic character. On the other hand, informal or folk santos drew from the indigenous sculpture styles of the angular and squat anitos with round preternatural eyes.

With the independence of Mexico and the loss of the royal subsidy for the Philippines, Spain let go of its monopoly on trade and opened the ports of the country. Foreign merchant houses owned by the British, French, Germans, and Americans established their offices along Manila Bay and stimulated the cash economy. The new situation opened positions for local agents and dealers to serve as liaison for the merchants. Moneylenders, mostly Chinese mestizos, flourished. Landlords converted from the traditional produce of rice to the new export crops in demand, such as sugar, coffee, abaca, and copra. The quota system was introduced thereby applying greater pressure on the peasant farmers. The surplus from the sale of the cash crops was accrued to the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated) class whose members became the new patrons of the arts. Higher education in the universities in Manila or abroad, in Spain and France, became accessible with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1859.

Influenced by <b>cubism</b>, they sought to explore modernist styles of approaching the figure. They arrived at the style called <b>transparent cubism</b>, which fused the cubist structuring of the figure with transparent effects, resulting in the indigenization of the original School of Paris style. It is often observed that, unlike European cubism which fragmented the human form, the cubism of the Neo-Realists did more than cut up forms&#x2014;they reorganized them into facets or transparent planes. One artist who showed cubist influence was Federico Aguilar<strong> </strong>Alcuaz who spent many years in Europe, where he designed abstract tapestries.<b> </b>Vicente Manansala expanded the subject matter of art, culling inspiration from the rural idylls of the Amorsolo School to the postwar urban realities of jeepneys recycled from the war, candle and amulet vendors in Quiapo (which was the hub of economic struggle), to the patchwork <a href=\"/2/5/221\"><i>barong-barong</i></a> (shanties) in Manila, which appeared following postwar displacement and poverty. H.R. Ocampo worked on proletarian art showing the poor and the stark social contrasts in the urban setting. One of the important works to come out of the period, <b><i>Calvary</i></b>, 1948, shows Christ on the cross, flanked by the two thieves against a background of factories spewing forth noxious orange fumes. He subsequently moved away from social themes and sought to develop a Filipino abstract idiom. Later, he became widely known for an abstract style of interlocking colored planes, as in his <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1969, curtain design for the <a href=\"/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>. Cesar Legaspi traversed different periods in his works during the development of his modernist idiom. Legaspi created proletarian art with his painting <b><i>The Beggars</i></b> (also titled <b><i><strong><strong>The Kiss</strong></strong></i></b>), 1945, showing two wretched figures huddled among the ruins in monochrome brown with cubist fragmentation. Later works drew their imagery from stone quarries and carved tribal icons in the search for basic origins.

Jaime de Guzman painted historical murals of the 19th-century propaganda movement and revolution against Spain in a painterly, expressionistic style.

Another strong artistic personality who lent brilliance to the 1960s was Danilo Dalena. A political cartoonist, he is known for paintings of large crowds of people in quest of luck or miracles and of unflinchingly realist character studies and drawings of the steamy side of the city. It was primarily Dalena who carried on the tradition in popular forms begun in the 1960s and resumed in the 1970s by the modernists. Ben Cabrera, in his low-key but intellectually experimental style, explored images of the Filipino in prints and watercolors inspired by turn-of-the-century photographs that he analyzed, drawing out a rich semiotic vocabulary with which he made subtle, ironic comments on the colonial relationship and the question of national identity.

This is exemplified by the activities of the now defunct <a href=\"/3/3/3449\">Black Artists in Asia</a> of Negros, whose members included&#xA0;<a href=\"/3/17/3474\">Charlie Co</a> and <a href=\"/3/17/3394\">Nunelucio Alvarado</a>, and the <a href=\"/3/17/3430\">Baguio Arts Guild</a>, whose members included <a href=\"/3/17/3453\">Santiago Bose</a>, <a href=\"/4/4/4490\">Kidlat Tahimik</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"/3/17/3824\">Roberto Villanueva</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3751\">John Frank Sabado</a>, and BenCab. Spaces for art would open up such as in the exhibits of the Silangan Foundation for the Arts, Culture and Ecology, based in Antipolo, which showcased a diversely aligned set of then emerging artists such as Salvador Alonday, <a href=\"/3/17/3452\">Elmer Borlongan</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3566\">Emmanuel Garibay</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3603\">Mark Justiniani</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3614\">Antonio Lea&#xF1;o</a>, and Jose Santos III."

Highlighting the global network for the advocacy of women&#x2019;s voices, the exhibit <b><i>Trauma Interrupted</i></b>, 2007, held at the CCP, gathered several artists from different countries to present works in which women both evoked and worked out their experiences of oppression brought on by war and patriarchy."

Its earlier project was <b><i>Tutok: Karapatan </i></b>(Focus: Human Rights), which tackled the extrajudicial killings of journalists and progressive community leaders. Following its success, the artist-organizers under the aegis of the Constantino Foundation continued on with the advocacy work of the Tutok<b> </b>series, which, like the first, brought together young and mid-career artists to harness their art&apos;s potency in popular education."

Art competitions sponsored by big corporations and banks, such as Shell, Petron, Metrobank, and the Philippine Art Awards (Philip Morris Group of Companies), developed mechanisms that recognized new and young talents and rewarded the accomplishment of elders. The participation of Filipino artists in international biennales and triennales as well as the upsurge in the global trafficking of art commercially also affected the international circulation of Philippine art."

Santiago Bose&#x2019;s <i>anting-anting </i>trope, for instance,&#xA0;brings out these political tensions not only in terms of the imagery but in the active approach to enable meaning through working with the material and ground, which is molded, scarified, gouged, fired, layered, and variously distressed with scratches, erasures, scribbles, and burns in a highly material kind of semiotics. Consistently the major proponents of the use of indigenous materials in their work are <a href=\"/3/3/3371\">Paz Abad Santos</a> and <a href=\"/3/17/3602\">Junyee</a>, although Abad Santos has also geared her art to therapy in her work on color recognition for the blind.

Its background is supported by the artist&#x2019;s family roots in the piano-making industry in the Philippines.

This turmoil is conveyed with the use of recurrent Western and Philippine symbols."

				"value": "Manny Garibay, meanwhile, interrogates the traditional identity of God and replaces it with multiple identities: as woman, as derelict, as abandoned street child. In his works, there is a constant shifting of genders, man/woman and vice versa, as well as the surprising appearance of Christ in various guises. Another peer, Elmer Borlongan, is an artist who pursues an original vision that derives from the everyday life of ordinary people. He gives his subjects a mystical dimension that makes them stand out, suggesting a strength of will that can overcome the dreary and desperate conditions of their lives. Mark Justiniani in turn has weighed in on America&#x2019;s 9/11 event that shifted the political temper of international security in 21st century. Based on the artist&#x2019;s personal recounting, it ironically took a long-distance call from the Philippines to relay a wake-up message about the fiery devastation in the heart of New York. Avoiding a grim approach, the artist brings to his work on the subject a surrealist seriocomic touch. For on the crumpled bed lies a grunting, half-yawning half-shrieking humanoid jolted from sleep, the bedside TV turned on by remote control and unfolding the gut-wrenching catastrophe on an otherwise uneventful morning. Among Filipino artists, it is <a href=\"/3/3/3536\">Alfredo Esquillo</a> who has given close scrutiny to the subject of folk religiosity. He has discovered that the folk mind is captive to a powerful triad: folk Christianity centering on the Passion of the <a href=\"/3/82/2146\">Nazarene</a>, the TV media, and sex."

An occasion in which Filipino artists shone before a foreign audience was the participation of the local group New World Disorder in the theater festival Trilogy of Globalization held in Hamburg, Germany, 2004. Stark visual contrasts also played an important part in one&#xA0;performance-installation-video of <a href=\"/3/17/3491\">Mideo Cruz</a>: antiseptic white walls and furniture against bloody red, sharp edges against chaos, bourgeois authority against squalid effusion, human against animal, one against many."

				"value": "The interactive impulse brought on by networking technology has further heightened artists&#x2019; willingness to collaborate, though this propensity itself has underpinned analog methods such as painting. The mural <b><i>Crossroads of the Filipino People</i></b>, 2007, is the collective work of the <a href=\"/3/17/3680\">Neo-Angono Artists Collective</a> including <a href=\"/3/3/3805\">Rommel &#x201C;Wire&#x201D; Tuazon</a>, Richard Gappi, Katrina Miranda-Tuason, Michael de Guzman, and Allan G. Alcantara, a number of them fine arts graduates of the University of the Philippines. Relevant to the times, this National Press Club-commissioned mural dealt with the theme of the history of press freedom from the 19th century to the present, but this ironically became the subject of censorship. The CCP issued a statement commending the Neo-Angono Artists Collective for standing up for their rights, and enjoined the rest of the artistic community to do the same. Ironically, CCP became embroiled in another controversy concerning the closure of the exhibit <b><i>Kulo </i></b>(Boil), 2011, because of a contested installation work, <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2273\"><strong>Poleteismo</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Polytheism), 2011, by Mideo Cruz. This incorporated an image of male genitalia on a Christian cross. Issues on the freedom of expression were compounded by the loud protest that came from the Catholic Church and the role of media and politicians in defining art based on diverging interests. Artists have gone through many exciting events, discoveries, and challenges that affect the production, circulation, and reception of art. While artists continue to respond to contemporary material conditions and global issues that affect the lives of all, the need for a discerning gaze and nuanced understanding of art is necessary for an integrated reading and retelling of the Filipino peoples&#x2019; multivocal stories at various periods of their collective history. <span class>&#xA0;</span> "

Scientific excavation is the chief means by which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials</a> are methodically retrieved and meticulously recorded for analysis in the laboratory. Stratigraphy, artifact typology, <strong><span style=\"font-weight:normal\">thermoluminescence</span></strong>, and radiocarbon dating are some of the methods employed to accurately date the sites and finds. Where cultural artifacts have been removed from their original contexts, the presence of metal and Asian trade ceramics and beads, among other datable objects found in direct association with them, are used to approximate their dates. Largely due to advances in scientific research of the past 30 years, the following have emerged as some of the most important markers of the region&rsquo;s ancient past.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><a id=\"modern\" name=\"modern\"></a><strong>Modern Early Humans</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some 50,000 years ago, modern humans&mdash;direct ancestors of Australian aborigines and Melanesians&mdash;reached Oceania from Australia. A skull in the Niah Cave in Sarawak, Malaysia, dating to around 38,000 BCE, and a skull fragment from the Tabon Cave in Palawan, dating to around 16,700 BCE, were the first direct evidences of modern early humans in Island Southeast Asia. Hunters and gatherers settled the Philippines, reaching Palawan around 47,000 years ago. In canoes or rafts, these pioneers crossed islands no more than 90 kms apart, using passageways of islands that became submerged after about 12,000 years during the late Pleistocene period. Early hunters and gatherers were basically stone toolmakers and users. However, recent studies indicate that they also used stone to make other tools out of bamboo, rattan, and wood. They caught game by trapping. Early modern humans&mdash;still hunters and gatherers&mdash;cultivated a few plants but did not yet domesticate animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"beginnings\" name=\"beginnings\"></a>Beginnings of Agriculture</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After two million years in the Paleolithic stage of hunting and gathering and not long after the rise and fall of sea levels about 10,000-12,000 years ago, agriculture emerged and irreversibly changed humankind&rsquo;s adaptation for survival. Out of southern China and into Taiwan around 5,500 years ago came farmers who domesticated rice and animals (pigs, dogs, and poultry), wove fiber, and knew carpentry skills. Agricultural records establish that speakers of Austronesian, the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, passed through the Philippines via Batanes and Luzon around 4,500 years ago and settled in lands occupied by hunters and gatherers. About 3,300-4,000 years ago, maritime knowledge allowed them to span out over Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific, practicing and introducing horticulture and boat-making skills as they migrated. Well before they spread beyond Luzon, however, these early agriculturalists had tools that included shell artifacts, shell and stone adzes, and gouges. They also made a variety of red-slipped, painted, impressed, incised, excised, and polished <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">pottery</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Crossing Island Southeast Asia into the Indian and Pacific Oceans, these early agriculturalists reached Madagascar in the West by 500 CE and New Zealand (Polynesia) in the East by 1200 CE. Evidence of their presence in Melanesia was the appearance of the Lapita Culture that later spread into the uninhabited Pacific. The settlement of the Asia-Pacific region by these Austronesian speakers was the earliest and most remarkable story of maritime colonization. The Philippines as a jump-off point was vital in the transference of Austronesian cultures that eventually reached halfway around the world. A significant marker of this migration that came through the Philippines was the knowledge of jade working from Taiwan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"jade\" name=\"jade\"></a>Jade Trade 2,500 Years Ago</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early artisans left evidence of an ancient workshop of green jade in Batanes, northernmost islands of the Philippines. The site was part of a trade network that survived for 2,500 years (1500 BCE through 1000 CE), which included Fengtian, Taiwan, the only known source of green jade (nephrite) in the region. The source of the white jade, used contemporaneously in the Philippines to make bracelets, adzes, beads, and the ubiquitous <b>lingling-o</b><i> </i>ear ornaments, has not been located. Lingling-o reached the Tabon Caves in Palawan, southern Vietnam, the Niah Caves in Sarawak, southern Thailand, and possibly Cambodia. Fengtian nephrites from Taiwan initially came in the form of adzes, axes, and spear points. These were later refashioned into prestige ornaments, as evidenced in excavated sites in Batanes and nearby Lanyu island, now part of Taiwan. While green jade came to the Philippines from Taiwan, with the tradition of jade perhaps coming from China through Taiwan, early Filipinos contributed to this ancient international trade with their skill and technique, developing a style of jade carving, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2204\">lingling-o found in Uyaw Cave</a>, Lipuun Point, Palawan (ca 500-300 BCE), which may have been carried to as far as Maori New Zealand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"pottery\" name=\"pottery\"></a>Early Pottery</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early Filipinos were adept at collecting clay and forming, sun-drying, and baking earthenware in open fires. Shaping was done by hand with or without a turntable, after which the earthenware was fired in the open field using forest wood, bamboo, dry leaves, and grass. There were no kilns or ovens in prehistoric earthenware sites in the Philippines. Hand-shaping methods included coiling, pinching, pressing, molding, and slab-building. While the simple globular pot was likely the earliest and most dispersed form, presentation dishes and jarlets were also found in ancient sites. As early as 5000-1000 BCE, pottery in Taiwan, the Philippines, the island of Borneo, and other parts of Indonesia had surfaces with red slips (clay with the consistency of cream poured onto the surface) while others were impressed with patterns using cord-bound and carved paddles. By about 4780-4400 BCE, dated archaeological artifacts from the central Philippines, Cagayan Valley, and Palawan demonstrate the already widespread use of slipped, painted, impressed, incised, excised, and appliqu&eacute;d pottery. Forms were not repeated in large numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">What began as the crafting of single pieces during the Neolithic period (4000/3000-500 BCE) evolved with technology into the sophisticated and mass-produced vessels of the late Metal Age (200 BCE-900 CE), such as the anthropomorphic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2224\">burial jar from Maitum</a>, Sarangani Province (5 BCE-370 CE). Their larger numbers, wider range of forms, and elaborately decorated surfaces characterized local pottery prior to contact with the great traditions of China and India (before 900 CE), a period popularly regarded as the golden age of Philippine pottery. The ever-increasing local demand for high-fired Chinese ceramics during the Song (906-1279), Yuan (1279-1368), and Ming (1368-1644) dynasties resulted in a leveling off of artistic culture in the region, with local pottery forms becoming simplified and their functions more utilitarian, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2158\">pot with inscriptions from Calatagan, Batangas</a> (possibly 1600s). Local pottery technology did not recover until the 19th century, and only temporarily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><strong><a id=\"interisland\" name=\"interisland\"></a>Early Interisland Trade</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ancient trade networks operated on similar economic principles as modern ones. Local pottery was a major item of commerce then as it was in historical times. In prehistory, pottery may have been more intensely manufactured during off-planting seasons with the goal of exchanging pots for other needed items. Pottery sharing traits in manufacture, form, and decoration but found in widely dispersed archaeological sites seems to indicate long-established patterns of exchange. Gleaned from these finds are networks of early interisland trade, most notably between (a) Mindoro, Batangas, Laguna, and Rizal provinces; (b) coastal northeast Panay, eastern Negros, and northwest Cebu; (c) southern Bohol, southern Leyte, and northeastern Mindanao; (d) western Bicol, northern Samar, and Marinduque; (e) the Pe&ntilde;ablanca area of Cagayan Valley and Northern Luzon; (f) the Tabon Cave complex in Palawan; and (g) the Bacong site, Negros Oriental, and the Hoyop Hoyopan Cave in Albay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong><a id=\"gold\" name=\"gold\"></a>Early Gold</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Before ironwork in Southeast Asia, linguistic studies show that people using stone and shell implements had words to describe metal and man-made metal items. Although this cannot be dated scientifically, gold was probably the first precious metal to be shaped. Gold beads from Guri Cave in the Tabon Cave complex of southwestern Palawan are the earliest gold items associated with archaeologically excavated artifacts in what is now the Philippines. They trace back to 500-300 CE. Only from the 10th century CE onward, however, and particularly from the 12th to the 15th century, do intricately crafted gold artifacts occur plentifully in the archipelago.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Gold was abundant in the Philippines, and ancient burial customs favored adornments made from this precious metal. Worked gold was found in various parts of the archipelago: central Luzon (Novaliches, Rizal, Laguna) yielded <i>piloncitos</i> (tiny gold coins used by Filipinos for barter during pre-Hispanic times) similar to those found in Sri Vijayan sites (700-1377 CE); northwestern Luzon (Bolinao in Pangasinan) and southern Luzon (Sorsogon) yielded gold beads and ornaments; and the islands of Mindoro, Palawan, Cebu, Panay, and Bohol in the central Philippines yielded a variety of <b>repouss&eacute; </b>jewelry, beads, dental inlay, and gold sheet face covers, such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2244\">Oton death mask</a> (late 1500s to early 1600s). So far, excavated sites in Butuan and Surigao in northeastern Mindanao and Samar in eastern Visayas have produced the widest range and largest quantities of gold ornaments. These centers of gold production have yielded pieces unrivaled in Island Southeast Asia, evidencing sophisticated techniques like <b>granulation</b>, where minute balls of gold are used to create patterns on gold sheets; <b>fusion welding</b>, in which organic glue and acetate copper are used to adhere gold granules onto surfaces upon which oxygen-free flame is applied; <b>chasing</b>, in which designs are inscribed on the surface; repouss&eacute;, in which the designs are hammered out from the back; and <b>casting</b>, in which the <b>lost-wax</b> method is employed to make solid components for gold chains, necklaces, rings, and earrings. The gold collection of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3435\">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas</a> (Central Bank of the Philippines) possesses numerous examples made with these techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"trappings\" name=\"trappings\"></a>Trappings of Power</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As far back as the Neolithic period (4000/3000-500 BCE), charismatic chieftains emerged from pools of &ldquo;valiants&rdquo; or men of prowess. These leaders, only sometimes inheriting their offices, knew how to gather followers by making ostensive displays of influence, wearing sumptuous jewelry, and dressing in resplendent clothing. They periodically sponsored elaborate feasts that fed and entertained multitudes, thus reinforcing their status and authority. After contact with the great traditions of India and China, indigenous leaders and their small states began taking the trappings of the greater ones. The Song Shi or Song dynasty history notes that Butuan and Samal kings began co-opting foreign emblems of authority at the start of the 11th century. Rulers coveted ceremonial flags and military titles that the Chinese court bestowed on tributary states and, as late as the 16th century, high-ranking persons wore the <i>upavita </i>(<i>yajnopavita</i> or sacred thread), a cord slung over one shoulder by all those twice-born (having undergone both physical and spiritual births), a tradition reserved for members of the higher castes of Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas in India. A gold upavita of significant weight and proportion is in the collection of the Ayala Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"polities\" name=\"polities\"></a>Early Polities</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chinese and Arab chronicles record the rise of power centers in the 10th and 11th centuries, including P&rsquo;u-tuan/Butuan and Ma-I, and in the 15th and 16th centuries, including Manila, Maguindanao, Sulu, and Cebu. These chieftainships held sway over shifting alliances with second-tier power centers. Chieftains wore gold regalia to reinforce their legitimacy and many used gold for adornment, marriage, burials, and other rituals. They exchanged pottery for sea and forest products from second-tier power centers, which in turn paid for Chinese, Thai, Vietnamese, and Khmer stoneware and porcelains&mdash;goods that enhanced their status during &ldquo;feasts of merit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the largest yields of archaeological gold has come from Butuan, Agusan del Norte, northeastern Mindanao. As early as 320 CE and on vessels called <b>balanghai</b> constructed for long-distance travel, Butuanon navigated not only the Agusan River and marshlands but also the sea. Like others plying the South China Sea, they used wooden planks for their hulls with edges pegged down side by side, as seen in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2135\">balanghai<i> </i>(320 CE)</a>. The location of their settlements shifted with changes to local shorelines and riverbanks. They depended on metal, pottery, forest produce, and foreign trade. Gold was bountiful and goldsmithing was practiced vigorously, alongside bronze- and ironworking. Butuan&rsquo;s population appears to have expanded and contracted between the 10th and 13th centuries. As evidenced by high-fired Asian trade ware, other urban centers took part in the same maritime networks, including Surigao, also in northeastern Mindanao; Batangas and Mindoro in southern Luzon; and Samar in eastern Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\"><a id=\"indian\" name=\"indian\"></a></span></span></span><strong>Indian Influence</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After Sanskrit came into the Philippine languages between 900 CE and 1000 CE, gold began to be worked on with increasing sophistication. Indic influence on Philippine religious, intellectual, and cultural life may be seen in words like <i>bathala</i> (god), <i>diwata</i> (deity), <i>budhi</i> (conscience), and <i>bhas</i>a (language), some of the 150 Indic words that entered the Philippine languages. Studies show that these terms came through non-Sanskrit speakers, such as Filipino travelers and other Southeast Asian islanders, possibly from the Hinduized Sri-Vijaya empire whose base was in Sumatra (700-1377 CE). As important carriers of Indic influence in Southeast Asia, these non-Sanskrit speakers had brief but profound links with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> speakers and had made independent contact through trade at separate periods of history with the people of Sulu and the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While these may not have been found in archaeological contexts, gold figures in the Ayala Museum collection&mdash;the <b>garuda</b>,<i> </i><b>nagaraja</b>, and <b>kinnari</b>&mdash;have nonetheless broached the possibility of a local Hindu-Buddhist iconography developing in the Philippines. Other evidence, possibly from the Proto-historic period (1000-1300 CE), found in the past 30 years include an <b><i>Ivory Seal </i></b>that reads &ldquo;But-wan&rdquo; in ancient Javanese or early Kawi script (undated) at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a> and a Tantric inscription on a strip of gold found in Butuan in a private collection. Pieces established early on in the country&rsquo;s archaeological record are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2191\"><b><i>Golden Image of Tara</i></b></a>,<b><i> </i></b>consort of a Bodhisattva of Mahayana or Vajrayana/Tantric Buddhism (late 13th to early 14th century), which a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a> woman found in Esperanza, Agusan del Sur, now in the Field Museum in Chicago; the <b><i>Avalokitesvara-Padmapani Clay</i> <i>Medallion</i></b> from Calatagan, Batangas (12th-13th century), in the National Museum of the Philippines; the <b><i>Bronze Lokesvara Statue</i></b> from Cebu (12th-13th century), lost during World War II; and the <b><i>Golden Garuda Pendant</i></b> from Brooks Point, Palawan (early 14th century), stolen from the National Museum in 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"rise\" name=\"rise\"></a>Rise and Fall of Butuan</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Understanding early links with Hindu-Buddhist and Muslim traditions perforce starts with the rise and fall of ancient Butuan. Over the span of four years (1003-1007 CE), Chinese chroniclers note that the Butuan ruler Kiling (Qi-ling) sent missions requesting to pay tribute directly to China, thereby bypassing Champa in the exchange of tribute gifts. Kiling was denied, but other Butuan missions followed. In 1011, a Butuan ruler with the Indianized name Sri Bata Shaji succeeded in having Butuan recognized as a tributary state after having sent the Chinese court a memorial engraved on a gold tablet, along with an impressive stock of cloves from the Moluccas. &ldquo;To honor a distant land,&rdquo; the Chinese awarded the Butuan representative with a military title, armor, ceremonial flags, and pennons (flags with tapering tails). After 1300, Muslim influence in Southeast Asia grew. Islamized Brunei, Sulu, western Mindanao, and southern Luzon challenged Indianized Butuan and, not long after, Brunei claimed Butuan as a dependency. When the Spaniards arrived in 1521, Butuan was past its zenith. While Butuanons continued to extract gold, they did so only for personal use, and because the early Spanish colonizers confiscated what gold they found, the locals eventually discontinued its sourcing, processing, and production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"international\" name=\"international\"></a>International Trade during Protohistory</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since the Proto-historic period (900-1500 CE), seamanship was an important feature of trade and population movements. Chinese junks came with ironware, brassware, tin, porcelain, stoneware, unglazed pottery, silk threads, sarsaparilla (chinaroot), incense, and glass beads. Bornean <i>parao</i> sailed in with camphor, fine-woven mats, sago cakes, perfumes, drugs, Bornean red cloth, Indian chintz, and Javanese batik. The Visayas traded with wax, civet musk, cinnamon, dyewood and aromatic hardwood, red resin, and red ants (for Chinese ink), and Sulu provided pearls, corals, and tortoise shell. Butuan supplied its staple trade of gold, wax, and slaves; and other sites in Mindanao sent deerskin, antlers, and caged civet cats to Japan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1565, Basque Spanish navigator Miguel Lopez de Legazpi arrived in the Visayas to colonize the Philippines. His chronicler recorded an interview with the chief pilot of a captured parao owned by a Portuguese and loaded with cargo funded by the sultan of Brunei. The &ldquo;Moro&rdquo; informed the general that their two junks from Luzon were in Butuan bartering for gold, wax, and slaves and that the captured parao traded with goods similar to those carried by the Borneans: all from China. While the locals considered the Bornean and Luzon boats as Chinese junks, he added, the actual junks from China were too large to come close to the islands (Anon. 1565, 467).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In fact, large Chinese junks delivered goods to Manila and Borneo and smaller Malay-operated boats redistributed goods to the Visayas in exchange for gold and slaves. What is gleaned from these early chronicles is that highly developed polities in the archipelago enjoying a thriving international trade were in place long before the Europeans first mentioned the Philippines as people of Lu&ccedil;oes in Suma Oriental, 1513, and that a system of interregional cooperation was in practice well before explorer Ferdinand Magellan first landed in these islands in 1521. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by&nbsp;<em><strong>Purissima Benitez-Johannot</strong> </em></strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"related\" name=\"related\"></a>Related Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\" target=\"_self\">Pottery</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2191\" target=\"_self\">[Golden Tara of Agusan]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2204\" target=\"_self\">[Jade&nbsp;lingling-o with three budlike projections]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2224\" target=\"_self\">[Maitum Jar No. 21]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2158\" target=\"_self\">[Calatagan Pot Nmp 1961-A-21]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2135\" target=\"_self\">[Balanghai CE 320]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><a id=\"sources\" name=\"sources\"></a>Sources</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Bacus, Elizabeth A. 1996. &ldquo;Late Prehistoric Chiefly Polities in the Dumaguete-Bacong Area and Central Philippine Islands.&rdquo;<em>Philippine Quarterly of Culture and Society</em>24 (Mar/Jun): 5-58.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bellwood, Peter, Hsiao-Chun Hung, and Yoshiyuki Iizuka. 2011/2012. &ldquo;Taiwan Jade in the Philippines: Three Thousand Years of Trade and Long-Distance Interaction.&rdquo; In<em>Paths of Origins: The Austronesian Heritage in the National Museum of the Philippines, Museum Nasional Indonesia, and the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde</em>, edited by Purissima Benitez-Johannot, 30-41.

Out of southern China and into Taiwan around 5,500 years ago came farmers who domesticated rice and animals (pigs, dogs, and poultry), wove fiber, and knew carpentry skills. Agricultural records establish that speakers of Austronesian, the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family, passed through the Philippines via Batanes and Luzon around 4,500 years ago and settled in lands occupied by hunters and gatherers. About 3,300-4,000 years ago, maritime knowledge allowed them to span out over Island Southeast Asia and the Pacific, practicing and introducing horticulture and boat-making skills as they migrated. Well before they spread beyond Luzon, however, these early agriculturalists had tools that included shell artifacts, shell and stone adzes, and gouges.

The settlement of the Asia-Pacific region by these Austronesian speakers was the earliest and most remarkable story of maritime colonization. The Philippines as a jump-off point was vital in the transference of Austronesian cultures that eventually reached halfway around the world. A significant marker of this migration that came through the Philippines was the knowledge of jade working from Taiwan."

These are the ethnolinguistic groups that traditionally reside in Northern Luzon and Mindanao, and parts of Luzon and the Visayas. Their living traditions are also called <b>indigenous art</b> (referring to a place and locality), <b>ethnic art</b> (referring to ethnicity), and <b>traditional art</b> (referring to art practices of more than one generation), based on categories of identity, language, and longevity of practice. In many ways, these art forms defy Western art categories, and should be seen in integration with the lifeways of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Scholars of Philippine culture have introduced various concepts to refer to the art practices that either originated from precolonial times, or developed during the period of colonization&mdash;both of which continue to persist and are still practiced in the Philippines. &ldquo;<b>People&rsquo;s art</b>&rdquo;<b> </b>refers to art of the Filipino masses, in contrast to the academic and elite connotation of art (de Leon 1981, 1-15). Alternately, &ldquo;<b>sining bayan</b>&rdquo; refers to art forms and practices that exhibit the fusion of indigenous and lowland Christian culture, adapting the use of its material to its immediate environment (Fajardo 2005, 119). Finally, &ldquo;<b>sining lumad</b>&rdquo; refers to the art and culture of communities that resisted the influences of the colonizers and largely maintained their traditional culture linked to Southeast Asia (De La Paz and Flores 1997, 122). Another discourse refers to <b>Philippine Muslim arts</b> as a distinct category to signify the hybridity of the Islamic faith with traditional culture of the <i>lumad</i> (Sakili 2003, 21-49). The commonality of these concepts points to the resiliency of traditional culture to become living traditions in contemporary times, the capacity to resist and/or adapt to the changing physical and social environment, and the belief that such a discourse is a necessary alternative to counteract the Western-dominated understanding of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The art forms that have developed and transformed in time may be traced to the ancient past and continue to the present as living traditions, adapting to and transforming based on the changing conditions in the physical and social environment. Closely linked with the natural environment, the production of such art is part of everyday life. It creates functional and decorative art forms using the processes of molding, weaving, carving, and casting. In many instances, the traditional belief system of animism permeates these art forms. Spirits are believed to inhabit nature, so that the designs and motifs found in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2114\">pottery</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2119\">textile</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2106\">mat weaving</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2112\">personal ornamentation</a>, wood carving, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2107\">metalcraft</a>, are derived from the natural world. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">Rituals</a> performed to propitiate spirits created a material culture of traditional belief systems in the form of ritual implements and symbolic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ancient cultural sources come from the Oceanic cultures of the Polynesian South Pacific, as in the practice of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2118\">tattooing</a> and wood carving. In precolonial times, a number of regional cultural traditions made their influence felt. These were the Southeast Asian Malay animist, the Indian Hindu Buddhist, the Chinese, and the Arabic-Islamic strains, which left lasting traces in Filipino culture. Before the 16th century, there were cultural links between southern Japan, the Ryukyus, and the Northern Philippines groups, brought about by ocean currents called &ldquo;culture of the warm currents.&rdquo; The seafarers from both sides exchanged dyestuff, beeswax, horn, and raw cotton, creating similarities of art practices in pottery and weaving (Respicio 2007, 19-21). In time, these various strains did not remain separate but intermeshed. Indigenous wood carving in the Philippines is a local expression of the larger Southeast Asian Malay wood-carving tradition. This is evident especially in the <b>okir</b><i> </i>art of the Muslim <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> of Mindanao and Sulu. The Maranao designs of the <b>sarimanok</b>, <b>naga</b>, and <b>pako rabong</b><i>&mdash;</i>with their repertoire of motifs&mdash;are related to the designs and motifs of the region. The sarimanok, which is a kingfisherlike bird, usually with a fish in its beak or base, belongs to the region&rsquo;s rich bird imagery derived from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, myths, and legends, such as the epic of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\">Darangen</a>. It is akin to the Indonesian <b>garuda</b><i> </i>and the Bornean hornbill, which grace house facades and boat prows. In Asian mythologies, birds are symbols of the human spirit and the transcendence of that spirit over matter, and symbols too of the liberation of the individual spirit as it merges with the universal soul. When the Islamic belief took hold in Mindanao in the 13th century in Sulu and spread to the island, the indigenous groups, such as the Tausug and Maranao, fused indigenous culture with Islamic belief, creating art forms that may be interpreted as hybridities in meaning and content. Thus, the sarimanok<i> </i>motif was regarded as Muslim art. Another figurative image in Islamic belief is the <b>burraq</b>, the hybrid half-animal and human, believed to be the vehicle of the Prophet Mohammed on his ascent to heaven. The image is comparable to the sphinx image of Egypt and Syria but, in the context of Muslim Mindanao, became integrated in <b>boras</b><i> </i>mat weaving, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>, and wood carving (Sakili 2003, 192-97).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The origins of the<i> </i>naga, the serpent design, is Indian Hindu-Buddhist, and the word itself is from Sanskrit. This is one of the traces of Indian influence in the country. In Agusan and other parts of Mindanao, figures of Hindu-Buddhist origin, such as the Shivaite golden image and the clay medallion of Avalokitesvara Padmapani, a lotus-bearing Hindu female deity, have been excavated. Furthermore, a number of Indian words have been assimilated into the native languages. Often, these words are spiritual concepts or have to do with spiritual activities, such as <i>diwa </i>(spirit),<i> diwata </i>(deity),<i> budhi </i>(conscience),<i> guro </i>(teacher), and even <i>bathala </i>(god). Moreover, a Philippine version of the Ramayana has been found by scholar Juan Francisco in the Lanao area of Mindanao and transcribed as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1899\"><strong>Maharadia Lawana</strong></a></i></b>,<i> </i>Lawana being the local version of the original Ravana. In Tausug dance, there is an emphasis on hand gestures as in the Indian <i>mudras</i>, further enhanced by the use of the <i>janggay </i>or silver fingernail extenders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early Chinese influence was seen in matters pertaining to trade and commerce. During the centuries of precolonial trade with China, large quantities of porcelain were brought into the country. These were highly valued and their shapes and designs soon influenced indigenous pottery. It was, however, with Spanish colonization that the Chinese influence on the arts became manifest. Chinese artisans were in great demand in the making of <i>santos</i> or holy images in wood and ivory. For xylography, the Chinese system of engraving was adopted for the first books printed in the country. Chinese artisans were also in demand in the building of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">churches</a> and houses, particularly for their supply of building <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials</a> such as tiles for roofing and lime for bonding stone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Preceding Spanish colonization by a century, Islam penetrated the islands from the Malay Archipelago in the 14th century. A Muslim sultanate was first established in Sulu, effectively introducing Islam as a way of life to a large area of the South. In art, Islamic manifestations were the mosques with their minarets and bulb-like domes and their calligraphic inscriptions from the Koran. Brassware in the making of ritual vessels, such as the <b>kendi</b><i> </i>and the <b>gadur</b>,<i> </i>shows the influence of Middle Eastern forms and motifs. An example of three-dimensional Islamic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> is the <b>burak</b>, the half-woman and half-horse figure that Mohammed rode on his way to heaven. Arabic calligraphy embellished brass vessels, jewelry, and various articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To this day adherence to these varied traditions persists even in the midst of serious challenges to lifeways brought about by economic and political impositions from colonizers and migrant settlers. During the Spanish colonial period, the indigenous traditions of wood carving, metalcraft, and embroidery were transformed for religious purposes in Catholic church rituals. The celebration of fiestas (religious festival) and Holy Week processions became platforms to exhibit and showcase the fusion of indigenous and Western art and beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the Spanish colonizers largely saw the indigenous groups as heathens that need to be converted to Christianity through military might, the American colonizers applied the derogatory term &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; to the indigenous people to imply backwardness and lack of civilization. Armed with this rationalization, the Americans subjugated the natives as part of their &ldquo;Manifest Destiny&rdquo; in the process called &ldquo;benevolent assimilation&rdquo; (Fermin 2004, 24). Along with military might, the American rulers sought to &ldquo;civilize&rdquo; the Filipinos through the introduction of education and the American way of life, turning the colonized Filipinos as &ldquo;little brown brothers.&rdquo; The discipline of anthropology and museology were used to depict the indigenous people as exotic cultures below the standards of the West. In the Saint Louis World&rsquo;s Fair in 1904 held in Missouri, USA, the American colonizers exhibited indigenous peoples of the Philippines as &ldquo;uncivilized&rdquo; and in need of American benevolent guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the Spanish period, the Americans continued the cash-crop economy system, which changed the terrain of the land. The planting of crops for export, such as sugar, corn, tobacco, and garlic, meant the displacement of indigenous plants that supply materials for the textile and mat-weaving traditions. Furthermore, American bombings during World War II in Northern Luzon in pursuit of the Japanese army destroyed lands where abaca used to flourish. Together with the introduction of industrial cotton and dyes, the weaving tradition of Ilocos also changed with the times, affecting texture, color, suppleness, and sturdiness of the woven fabric. In the south, Mindanao became the destination of migrant settlers from Luzon and the Visayas. While intermarriages occurred among indigenous, Christian, and Muslim groups, ethnic and cultural tensions sometimes arose, affecting the cultural context of indigenous art making. Christian missionary movements have also affected the religious and social dynamics of indigenous communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Subsequent Filipino governments after World War II contributed to the problem of ethnicity by creating a concept that divides majority vs minority cultures, fine art and craft, civilized groups and tribes. Such biases affected policymaking and resulted in sociocultural injustices. The continuing armed conflict in Mindanao and military campaigns against the Moro secessionist groups have resulted in the displacement of the indigenous peoples from their ancestral homes. Exploiting the ancestral lands of the lumad, mining corporations and multinational corporations have planted pineapple on large tracks of land, forcing out these communities, disrupting their link with the ancestral land, which is the ultimate source of inspiration of the indigenous arts. Moreover, the introduction of the market economy has changed the value of these art forms into commercial products. Tourism has also influenced the demand for these art forms as souvenirs of an &ldquo;exotic culture.&rdquo; Sometimes promoted by state institutions, the exotic fetishism of the traditional arts have created a problematic relationship between the ethnolinguistic groups and the creation of a national identity. While these art forms are often used as symbols of national identity and pride, the needs of the traditional communities have not been properly addressed by the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In keeping up with the times, laws and cultural policies from the state have also affected and influenced art production. With the introduction of the Indigenous People&rsquo;s Rights Act of 1997, the lumad have began asserting their right to their land and culture. With the institution of the state awards meant for the indigenous art, started by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> and continued in 1992 by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a> through the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (National Living Treasure Award), a few traditional artists have been given recognition for their artistry and contribution to traditional art. A parallel program is the establishment of the School of Living Traditions in areas where traditional art processes and knowledge could be passed on with the financial support of the state. In the midst of these challenges and opportunities, the traditional communities continue to develop these art forms along directions that reaffirm and strengthen the core of their own culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"pottery\" name=\"pottery\"></a>Pottery</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pottery stands among one of the most ancient arts. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2227\">Manunggul jar</a>, excavated in Palawan circa eighth century BC, shows the high artistic level that the art attained in ancient times. This large burial jar has a cover showing two men rowing a boat, suggesting the belief among early Filipinos in an afterlife across a mythical body of water. This could be related to the Southeast Asian belief that the dead ride &ldquo;spirit boats&rdquo; across a body of water to reach the other world. Around its body is an incised design of curved lines and dots. Extant examples of early Philippine pottery display a wide variety of shapes and decorative techniques, including incision, stippling, appliqu&eacute;, openwork, and impression by rope and mat. Designs are often geometric and include stylized nature motifs. A significant earthenware from the Late Neolithic period are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2224\">Maitum burial jars</a> found in Sarangani Province in Mindanao featuring anthropomorphic designs of individualized faces. Ancient burial jars were also found in Sorsogon and Samar (Briones 1977, 205-9). Smaller ancient pieces were unearthed in Luzon and the Visayas (Solheim 1977, 121-25). One of the better documented sites is Calatagan, Batangas, where diggers uncovered a whole range of pottery styles and forms: ring-footed bowls, stemmed and wide-bottomed cups, jars in the shape of turtles, female breasts, and gourds. Some sites in Batangas have also yielded small stone human figures called <b>licha</b>.<i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In contemporary times, pottery would become more and more associated with objects for daily use, such as the <b>palayok</b><i> </i>(clay pot) for cooking, and the <b>banga</b><i> </i>(clay jar)<i> </i>and <b>tapayan</b><i> </i>(liquid container) for storing liquids. Of the existing pottery traditions, that of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> of northern Luzon is unique for its overall stamped-in designs on the jars that are used for storing grains. The detailed, repetitive geometric designs are applied with metal-stamping tools on the full roundness of the jar as well as on the lid, which has a handle on top. In Vigan, Ilocos Sur, a tradition of high-temperature pottery, called <b>burnay</b>,<i> </i>persists in response to the continued demand for all kinds of containers: the palayok<i> </i>for cooking; the banga for storing drinking water; the <b>asinan</b><i> </i>(salt container) for storing salt; and the tapayan<i> </i>for fermenting basi<i> </i>(sugarcane wine) or curing bagoong (fish or shrimp fry preserved in brine). The materials for these pots are clay and sand previously mixed by carabao feet trudging round and round for about six hours. The mixture is prepared for the potter&rsquo;s wheel and there shaped into pieces, which are excellent studies in form. They are fired with wood gathered from nearby hills in a giant walk-in kiln that measures half-a-city-block long and is set on an incline. Only a few of these kilns are still operating. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3570\">Fidel Go</a>, 1990 Manlilikha ng Bayan awardee, is one of the notable potters in Vigan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"craving\" name=\"craving\"></a>Carving</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wood carving in the Cordilleras features stylized human figures, such as the male and female <b>bulol</b><i> </i>and <b>tat-tagu</b>, and numerous animal figures of ritual and the hunt, including the dog, the pig, and the boar. Its subject and style show affinities with the arts of Oceania and Polynesia, as well as New Guinea and Celebes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many centuries ago in northern Luzon, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a> built their magnificent stone-walled <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/241\">rice terraces</a>. These terraces make way for water from the mountaintop to irrigate the tiered fields and the valley below. Central to the Ifugao rice culture is the bulol, a stylized sculpture representation of a human figure in wood, used in rituals associated with the many stages of rice planting, healing, and the resolution of intertribal feuds, functioning as ancestral spirits and granary gods. Often found in pairs, these signify the value of fertility. The bulol also appears in spoons, bowls, walking sticks, grain containers, and even chili crushers. Human and animal motifs are also carved into the posts of Cordillera houses and into household objects like bowls, forks, and spoons. In the central post of the traditional house the same carved human figure appears and is referred to as <b>kinabagat</b>.<i> </i>On both sides of the main entrance door frame, similar guardian figures in relief are often found. The outer walls, never left plain, are often etched or gouged in geometric designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Status-conscious Ifugao society has numerous ways of demonstrating rank. The <b>hagabi</b>, a huge wooden bench with a slightly arched midsection, is the ultimate status symbol and proof of the owner&rsquo;s economic and political power. As the hagabi is transported over mountains and hills from the carving site to his house, the owner has to host a ritual feast in every village the hagabi passes. When the bench finally arrives in his place, it is positioned under the house where it is visible to passersby (Peralta 1977, 314-18).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ifugao carving is distinguished by its technique of using a sharp tool to contour, mold, gouge, and etch wavelike patterns and animal forms, such as pigs, lizards, and birds, on the surface of ritual boxes and containers, wooden food bowls, spoons, and other household utensils. Simpler carvings of stylized animal heads are found on the lids of the squarish coffins in the cliffs of Sagada and the caves of Kabayan, whose lids have reliefs of stylized animal heads in various permutations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wood sculpture among Muslim groups in western Mindanao is basically decorative. Its use of geometric patterns and stylized representations of floral and animal forms derives from the orthodox Islamic prohibition of realistic representations of humans and animals. This repertoire of carved forms is referred to as okir<i> </i>in Maranao or <b>ukkil</b><i> </i>in Tausug, meaning &ldquo;carved.&rdquo; In the islands of Sulu, limestone tombstones mark <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Badjao</a> graves, which are small enclosures resembling beds with headboards. These are embellished with stylized naga<i> </i>figures and vine-and-leaf designs. In Tunggusong and Tubig Indangan in the islands of Simunul and Manok Mangkao are found the most elaborate grave markers that make use of limestone blocks quarried from the site and stylized in openwork carving. Where wood is used, the figure of a horse or serpent is set inside the squarish enclosure. In Manubul island, small upright human figures mark the graves. When these figures are shrouded with a piece of white cloth, this means a ritual has just been performed. Okir also decorates the enormous naga figure while the sides of the boat sport elaborate vine-and-leaf motifs. These decorations are seen less and less nowadays with the introduction of outboard motors and the increasing tendency of the Islamic acculturated Badjao to settle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The principal okir designs are the sarimanok, the naga, and the pako rabong. The sarimanok, which is carved in wood, simply varnished or painted in many colors, or sometimes executed in brass, is the stylized design of a bird holding a fish in its beak and/or standing on a base in the shape of a fish. While its meaning derives from epics and myths, it also alludes to Lake Lanao&rsquo;s fertile waters. The naga has the form of an elaborate mythical serpent or dragon with a vigorous S-curve and numerous curvilinear motifs to suggest its scales. The pako rabong is a stylized growing fern with a broad base gracefully tapering upward. The sarimanok and naga are found in the <i>panolong</i>, the extended floor beam, and the interior beams and posts of the large sultan&rsquo;s house called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/229\"><i>torogan</i></a>. The torogan<i> </i>of the Maranao in mainland Mindanao features the flamboyant panolong, the protruding beams with colorful and exuberant serpent and vine-and-leaf okir. This impressive structure is expressive of the prestige, power, and wealth of its noble occupants. Side panels and boards are also embellished with okir and so too is its <i>tinai a walai </i>central crossbeam. The okir also ornaments other objects such as the <i>lankongan</i> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">kulintang</a> holder, the <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/815\">kudyapi</a> </i>or two-stringed lute, the <i>kampilan </i>or fighting sword, and the <i>pairaan </i>or tobacco container. It is also used in carving horns to produce the traditional Maranao chess set whose most elaborate piece is the knight. This knight is normally carved in the serpent motif identical to that used in the panolong. A variation of the okir is manifested in the handwoven <b>malong</b><i> </i>(Maranao cylindrical skirt) and in the surface decoration of metal, brass, and bronze containers used for betel-nut chew. Other carvings worth mentioning are the backstrap loom weaver&rsquo;s backrest, which is delicately carved with okir, and the wooden horse saddles and kris handles often made of bone or ivory. Scabbards are embellished with mother-of-pearl shell plates etched with tiny okir designs. The kris, encased in a mother-of-pearl-decked scabbard, used to be a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2098\">dress</a> imperative for the Tausug male who felt insecure without it, but the modern gun has just about rendered it extinct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> of Palawan use whimsical sculptures of birds, lizards, turtles, snakes, pigs, and other animals for their rituals, as house d&eacute;cor, and, at times, as toys for children. For these sculptures, a white softwood, called <i>tika</i>, is sun-dried for two days, carved then shaped with a small knife. After this, the figure is sandpapered with <i>is-is</i> leaves, rubbed with fresh camote leaves, which serves as primer, and blackened with soot produced either from burning the bark of the cashew tree or holding the figure over an open flame in which wood resin burns. Minute designs are then incised or etched on the surface, exposing the white wood underneath. Other notable pieces from the Tagbanwa are animal figures on dart holders. Blowguns made of double-layered bamboo tubes that propel darts at a phenomenal speed are themselves elaborately decorated with burnt-in surface designs. The carving of wooden figures may be linked to religion and ritual, for birds in Tagbanwa mythology are the messengers that link the many levels of heaven. Animals, like the pig and the wild boar, are the sacrificial offerings in rituals. The wooden sculptures are blackened and incised with geometric designs that bring out the original light tone of the material.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bamboo, which grows extensively and prodigiously throughout the country, has been utilized in so many ways by the different cultures. In Bulacan, bamboo is the primary material used in the construction of <b>singkaban</b> through the process of carving, whittling, and installation in public spaces. One of the most unique uses of the bamboo is found among the Maranao in its <i>lakob</i>, the traditional container for tobacco leaves. Multicolored geometric and okir motifs are imprinted on the body of the bamboo tube in a dye-resist process similar to the <b>ikat</b>, which is a complex process of paper pasting, tying, and boiling. The Maranao also do burnt-in designs on the <i>insi </i>or bamboo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flutes</a>, and the pairaan. Like them, the Kalinga, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2332\">Bagobo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2362\">Mangyan</a>, Hanunoo, and Palawan groups also burn in designs on bamboo, the latter more notably on their bamboo blowguns. Containers of lime are also often embellished with these designs. The Hanunoo Mangyan of Mindoro incise letters of their ancient syllabary called <i>surat mangyan</i> and other designs on the surface of bamboo containers and strips of bamboo. The letters are those of the <i>ambahan</i>, a poem that expresses personal feelings and thoughts. A master of this script, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5120\">Ginaw Bilog</a> from Oriental Mindoro, was honored in 1993 as a Manlilikha ng Bayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:-1.0pt\"><a id=\"weaving\" name=\"weaving\"></a></span></span></span><strong>Weaving</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The Philippines&rsquo; ethnic tradition of textiles also goes back to early times and shows its cultural affinity with the rest of Southeast Asia. Decorative weaving techniques, such as the supplementary weft found in much of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2380\">Yakan</a> weave, are shared with many countries of the region. Ikat is a decorative dyeing technique that is a regional tradition practiced among many Philippine groups, including the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> in their abaca <b>tnalak</b> weave and the Bagobo in their <b>dagmay</b>.<b> </b>In fact, the earliest example of ikat tie-dye in the region has been documented as having been found in an archaeological site in Banton Island off Romblon. Ethnic clothing also shows affinities with the rest of Southeast Asia. The Maranao cylindrical skirt called malong, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a> rectangular skirt called <b>tapis</b>,<i> </i>and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> checkered or striped skirt called <b>patadyong</b><i> </i>are prevalent in the region and so are different kinds of headgear such as the <b>pis</b><i> </i>and the <b>tubao</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippines was known to have woven fibers, such as pineapple, abaca, ramie, maguey, cotton, and bark cloth, but very few survived the humid tropical conditions that make the fiber disintegrate very fast. It is only through accounts of the early explorers and colonizers as well as travelers&rsquo; drawings that the materials of the clothes of the early lowland Filipinos have been documented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Evidence of bark cloth is found among the Ifugao and some of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> groups scattered throughout the Philippines. To make this cloth, the bark of two trees is stripped and spun into rough threads and then woven. Later, the introduction of cotton, which was successfully cultivated in the Ilocos region, was to alter the use of weaving materials, particularly in the adjoining regions of the Cordilleras. The use of indigenous dyes from the indigo plant also resulted in a major resurgence in traditional weaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santa Maria, Santiago, and Vigan in Ilocos Sur; Sarrat and Paoay in Ilocos Norte; and Bangar in La Union are major weaving towns. Santiago, Vigan, and Sarrat have been producing blankets with intricate designs called <b>binacol</b><i> </i>and <b>pinilian</b>. Early samples of these in handspun cotton dyed in light or dark indigo occasionally surface in antique shops in Manila. Some of these blankets are characterized by repetitive geometric designs that produce optical illusions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the Cordillera people, especially the Ifugao, Bontok, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2356\">Kankanaey</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2351\">Isneg</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a>, the tapis is standard wear for women and the G-string or loincloth for the men. Some wear capes, like the Gaddang; or a blanket, like the Bontok and Ifugao; or an abbreviated shirt, like the Isneg or Kalinga&mdash;but the basic dress remains the same. The ancient art of the ikat was known among the Ifugao, but by the 1970s it had all but totally vanished as a tradition. However, in the mid-1970s, an old lady named <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3701\">Kahhimngan Palatic</a>, 1990 Manlilikha ng Bayan awardee, revived the tradition in her native Amganad, six kilometers from Banaue. Subsequently, the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan (National Living Treasure) was given to the following textile weavers: Tboli tnalak weaver <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3527\">Lang Dulay</a> and Tagabawa Bagobo <b>inabal</b> weaver <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3667\">Salinta Monon</a>, both awarded in 1998; Tausug pis syabit weaver <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3769\">Darhata Sawabi</a>, in 2004; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> abel weaver <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3556\">Magdalena Gamayo</a>, in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Binodbodan</b><i> </i>(tied), a remarkable technique of embedding a design on the thread, is done by dyeing the tied threads in a vat with colors derived from natural sources&mdash;yellow from wild ginger, red from narra shavings, and black from mud with high iron content. The tied section will resist the dye. Once untied, the design appears on the finished cloth. This method is used for weaving blankets, G-strings, and tapis. The ikat process is also the dominant and, in some places, the only method used by the highland groups of eastern Mindanao, such as the Tboli, Bagobo,Tagakaolo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a>, Ubo, and Kalagan. Highly precise human, animal, and plant figures on top of geometric designs are produced on abaca cloth. The complexity of the ikat process is appreciated most with figurative designs, which may include frogs, birds, lizards, and human figures. Often the finished cloth is further enhanced by the addition of antique glass or ceramic beads, particularly among the Bagobo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another method is the <b>tritik</b> tie-and-dye technique used on the cloth of the Bagobo male headdress. The design is produced by sewing in portions of the cloth to resist the dye during the dyeing process. A headpiece may signify bravery and masculine power, the ultimate status symbol. The ikat process is also known among the western Mindanao Muslim groups, particularly among the Maranao and the Maguindanao. Producing intricate ikat designs on the malong using as many as four colors is definitely a very complex process, for it entails dipping in dye as many times as the number of colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A simpler form of ikat is the <b>tanggob</b><i> </i>(blanket), generally referred to as <b>babaloban</b><i> </i>(tied) in Maranao. The design on the <b>malong landap</b><i> </i>of the Maranao is characterized by the use of a narrow woven vertical strip called the <b>langkit</b>, crisscrossed horizontally by two narrower strips of langkit. Before World War II, the langkit was done in silk. As the supply of silk dwindled, the production of the tapestry strip also diminished. However, the small village of Bacolod Chico on the shore of Lanao Lake in Marawi continues to weave these strips. Their weaving styles include the <b>seputangen</b>, the square headdress; the <b>piantupan</b>, the brief skirts used over women&rsquo;s pants; the <b>siniluan</b>, pants material for both sexes; the <b>bunga sama</b>, for blouses; and the <b>inalaman</b>, the ceremonial skirts. Each of these woven materials uses a different weaving technique. Special weavers are needed for special pieces because each type needs a special skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The pis syabit<i> </i>and the <b>kandit</b><i> </i>are outstanding examples of Tausug weaving. The pis is a square headdress for the male, with complex multicolored geometric designs. The kandit or sash is a silk waistband in bold geometric patterns with sharp color contrasts. The sash has practically disappeared, while the pis continues to be woven in the towns of Parang and Maimbung in Jolo, Sulu. Also noteworthy is the &ldquo;tree of life&rdquo; appliqu&eacute; tapestry of the Sama of Tawi-Tawi. Impressive in its size of 2.1 x 3 m, it adds color and a festive air to weddings, circumcision rites, and other celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_6\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The weaving of hats, baskets, and mats is also widely practiced in the Philippines. The heat of the tropical sun and the recurrent rains make head covers necessary. These come in various forms and materials, as may be seen in the fine twine Tausug hat, the conical <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2360\">Maguindanao</a> hat, the flattish Maranao <b>sayap</b>, the &ldquo;cardinal&rdquo; hat of the Bontok, the rattan skullcap of the Ifugao, the wide-brimmed <b>salakot&nbsp;</b>of the Ilonggo, the <b>vakul</b> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2353\">Ivatans</a>, and the gourd helmets of the Ilocano. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3564\">Teofilo Garcia</a> of Abra received the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan in 2012 for creating headgears called <b>kattokong nga tabungaw </b>made of <i>upu </i>or gourd.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_7\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2096\">basketry</a> traditions in the country are many. On the eastern Mindanao highland is woven one of the most interesting baskets&mdash;the Mandaya backpack with an arched cover and trimmings that contrast with its black resin-coated body. The Bagobo baskets, on the other hand, are generally simple and functional, but personal bags are often decked with tiny bells and multicolored beads. The baskets of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a> of Cotabato are embellished with geometric motifs achieved by interweaving natural and dyed materials of contrasting colors. Occasionally, human figures appear as motifs. Among the Tagbanwa of Palawan, a highly attractive basket, called <b>basag</b>, with a conical cover stands out. The Hanunoo baskets of Mindoro are characterized by overplaiting on a basic woven surface. Basketry attained a high level of sophistication in form and function among the Ifugao. The sheer number of variations in design, form, and function is truly impressive. No decoration is added that is not intrinsic to the function of the basket. It is, however, the manner of plaiting, trimming, and shaping that make the Ifugao basket unique. Major Ifugao basket categories include the <b>acob</b>, a basket with a square base and a round cover used for storing husked rice; the <b>agawen</b>, a small, open basket carried on the hip and used for gathering snails in the fields; the <b>bangaw</b>, a traveler&rsquo;s backpack with a smooth black fiber covering it against the rain; the <b>binali</b>, a coiled-technique basket used to store grain; the <b>bulot</b>, a locust-storage basket; the <b>camoan</b>, a storage basket for husked rice; the <b>hoop</b>, a square basket for carrying food to the fields; the <b>hulol</b>, a funnel-shaped basket to catch locust; the <b>pasiking</b>, a backpack; the<i> </i><b>topil</b>, a food container for the field; and the <b>ulbong</b>, a spherical basket using the coiled technique for grain storage. Another unique Cordillera basket is found among the Kankanaey: a grain-storage basket trimmed with figures of lizards on all four corners, their necks serving as hooks for the string handles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the warm and humid climate of the Philippines, mats provide cool comfort. The giant and dwarf species of the pandanus leaf, swamp grass, buri palm leaf, bamboo,and rattan are used as basic materials for mats. In Romblon, wedding couples dance on a white buri mat with lacelike design on the edges resembling an outsized doily. As the couple dance, both groups of relatives compete with one another in pinning the biggest amount of money on their clothes. The mats of Basey, Samar, come in bright primary colors embroidered with designs of flowers, peacocks, and imaginary scenes, and when commissioned may carry the image and name of the owner. Just as colorful are the Maranao <b>sesed</b><i> </i>mats, which are mostly done in stripes and plaids. On the other hand, the Bontok use the simple <b>oho</b><i> </i>mats for rituals outside the house. The mat makers of the Tagbanwa in Palawan are notable for their workmanship in producing uniform strands, while the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a> are known for plain brown mats woven over with beige geometric decorations. But nowhere is mat making as developed as among the Badjao or Sama of Tawi-Tawi. The Badjao display bolder and freer use of color and concepts in comparison with the Sama who show a more restrained and disciplined approach to design. The mats of these groups are technically excellent, highly pliable, uniform in strand length, and durable because of their tight weave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Sama mats made in the island of Laminusa in Tawi-Tawi use the leaves of dwarf pandanus, which grows abundantly in the limestone and coral-based island. The leaves are cut, their spines and ribs removed, then halved, rolled into a coil about 25 cm in diameter, and boiled in salt water to make them insect proof. After boiling, the coil is sun-dried, opened, sliced evenly into smaller strips, and dyed in various colors using commercial dyes. The strips are then dried in the shade and pounded into the desired softness. After this, the strips are all woven into an intricate geometry of colors unmatched in the world. A complicated mat can take as much as a month and a half to finish. It is lined with a plain and coarser mat for protection and durability. Of the mats created in Laminusa, those woven by the household of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3757\">Maluy Lasa Sambaloni</a>, 1990 Manlilikha ng Bayan awardee, are among the finest. In 2004, mat weaver <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3403\">Haja Amina Appi</a> of Tawi-Tawi received the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\"><a id=\"metalwork\" name=\"metalwork\"></a></span></span></span><strong>Metalwork</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Metalwork has ancient roots in the Philippines. In practically all the archaeological sites, metal surfaced in the form of jewelry and weaponry. One of the most stunning achievements in this line is the precolonial gold jewelry retrieved from diggings in Butuan and Agusan. Most of the gold sites associated with the remains of the <b>balangay</b>, the huge hulking boats, have been plundered by illegal excavators. Nonetheless, what have surfaced in the antique market&mdash;such as belts, buckles, earrings, necklaces, head ornaments&mdash;are most impressive, demonstrating high technological skill.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another earliest artifacts were weaponry used not only for tribal warfare but also for hunting and food gathering. In the Metal Age, spears were produced as well as bladed weapons, some of them with handles embellished with geometric and curvilinear designs. These weapons were produced by means of the Malay forge in the cire perdue<i> </i>or lost-wax process wherein clay molds held the molten metal which took shape as it cooled. The weapons of southern Philippines, particularly the wavy kris, is part of a long Southeast Asian tradition of Malay metalwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_8\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the Mandaya woman&rsquo;s prized possessions is the huge silver-disk neckpiece. Some are as much as 20-25 cm in diameter, heavily etched with geometric motifs arranged in concentric patterns. The Bagobo attach tiny bells to practically everything they use: carrying bags, necklaces, anklets, bracelets, bolo handles, musical instruments, horse saddles, and others. The use of tiny bells is also popular among the Tboli. They use wide belts entirely made of brass chains trimmed with tiny brass bells. The Ifugao and the Bontok cast small brass or gold jewelry pieces. They produce necklaces in the form of stylized animal heads or full animal figures like pigs, dogs, and deer. The <b>dudong</b>, a small brass piece, sometimes but rarely in gold, representing a human figure and worn as wedding accessory, is one of the rarest and most valued status symbols. Walking sticks used for balancing on the terraced rice fields have handles ornamented with brass figures. The Ilongot or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2338\">Bugkalot</a> of Nueva Vizcaya use belts made of brass coiled tightly over copper wires and trimmed with tiny shells with serrated edges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Metal casting is actively pursued in the town of Tugaya where it is the main source of income of most residents. Small figures with intricate okir motif are produced in the ancient lost-wax technique, rendering each piece unique. This process involves the making of a wax model of the piece. A mixture of beeswax and wood resin is used for the model as well as for the intricate okir motif that overlays these. After the wax model is finished, it is cut into halves to extricate the wood mold inside. The halves are pieced together once more and coated on both sides with a mixture of pounded charcoal mixed with some clay. To make the wax model steady, the insides are filled with packed earth. The outside is once again coated with another layer of clay on top of the charcoal-based coat. After the model dries in the sun, the clay-coated piece is heated to melt out the wax model inside the piece, after which the molten brass is poured into the hole. After firing, the piece is split open and out comes the brass-casted piece. This piece is refined by filing, while the separate cast pieces are welded together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A metal product from Tugaya is the brass gadur, traditionally used as ceremonial containers for rice and tobacco. Cannons, as well as ceremonial pieces that could go as high as 2.4 m and carry complex figurative designs, are also produced by highly skilled metalworkers. One of them, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3608\">Rasid Laidan</a>, 1990 Manlilikha ng Bayan awardee, is known for the fine artistry of his brass works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The <b>loto-an</b>, betel nut container, is an excellent example of silver-inlaying technique. Some boxes that are not inlaid are found in the Bagobo, Tboli, Maguindanao, and Sulu areas. Larger boxes are used at home, while lighter pieces are carried around the waist. Most are rectangular, but a few are shaped like crescents, butterflies, and frogs. Metal buttons used to deck ceremonial clothes of both men and women are used by the Tausug, Yakan, Maranao, and Maguindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_9\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Weapons such as the kris, kampilan, or <b>gonong</b><i> </i>are cast in iron. Cooking pots, serving trays, tobacco-leaf trays, fireworks dispensers, as well as bracelets and rings with intricate designs, are all crafted in metal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Whether in weaving, metal casting, or brassware, surfaces are covered with rhythmically repeated geometric shapes, stylized male figures and animal forms, and other symbolic and decorative patterns. Of all the motifs, the male figure is most preferred by the Bagobo. The use of the male figure encased in broken line borders is expressive of the Tboli&rsquo;s confidence in themselves, their reverence for ancestral spirits, and their need for protection from evil. Animal forms have their own meanings: crocodiles and lizards are believed to have special magical traits; birds signify the flight of the soul to another realm; and frogs symbolize rain, magic, and fertility. Nature is represented by abstract symbolic designs. Horizontal zigzag lines stand for clouds, vertical ones for lightning, upright parallel lines connote rain, and crisscrosses are rice paddies. The river, which is associated in Blaan mythology with the origin of life, is represented by three lines and is sometimes done on cloth with glass beads and mother-of-pearl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The process of metalwork were utilized in Catholic rituals in the form of church <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> and objects. In Pampanga, the art of <b>pukpuk</b> or silver plating was used to create designs on altars and <b>karo</b> for religious procession. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3673\">Eduardo Mutuc</a><strong> </strong> was awarded as Manlilikha ng Bayan in 2004 for this art form and process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"personal\" name=\"personal\"></a>Personal Ornamentation</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Precolonial body ornaments and jewelry, which functioned as charms and amulets to drive away spirits, also constitute an important collection of artifacts. Many of these were fashioned in gold from the mines of the Cordilleras in the north and Camarines in southern Luzon. The tradition of silver filigree is also part of Filipinos&rsquo; Southeast Asian heritage. Indigenous designs in jewelry began in early times and continued into the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/14/2087\">Spanish period</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jewelry, another ancient art, began as amulets and charms to ward off evil spirits and to give supernatural powers to the wearer. The Cordillera groups have an ancient amulet design called the <b>lingling-o</b>. Said to signify fertility, this is found in necklaces, rings, and earrings. The Tboli wear some of the most splendid body ornaments of brass chains and bells; strings and nets of multicolored beads; and fine chains of horsehair forming neckpieces, earrings and rings, bracelets and anklets. Related to religious belief and social function, body ornaments are worn to please the gods, signify the status of the wearer, and enhance her charms. A belt, made of a row of brass bells that tinkle with every movement, calls attention to the presence of a young marriageable girl. Often, jewelry is worn along with elaborate tattoos on and around the arms and legs. These permanent body designs use motifs expressive of the animist worldview. To this day, <b>anting-anting</b><i> </i>or talisman medals with their mystical symbols and figures in relief are worn by the local folk as amulets rather than as mere body ornaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Part of body ornamentation in the precolonial period was the body tattoo. The ancient art of tattooing was so prevalent that Spanish colonizers did not fail to notice it, at one point calling the Visayas &ldquo;Islas de los Pintados.&rdquo; So elaborate were the designs covering entire bodies that they were mistaken for printed cloth from a distance. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2152\"><b><i>Boxer Codex</i></b></a>, which contained drawings of human types from different ethnic groups, shows men tattooed on the face and body with spiral designs and floral motifs. Up to the present, many old men and women of the Cordilleras bear the tattoo symbols of their group. The practice of tattooing was widely spread over the seafaring communities of Oceania and the South Pacific, including New Zealand where the chiefs sported elaborate facial and body marks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Kalinga and other Cordillera groups practice tattooing for beauty and status. A tattoo on a male may be a mark of seniority, bravery, and prowess in headhunting. Among women the tattoo tends to be purely ornamental, although it may also indicate her status as the headman&rsquo;s wife (Cabrera 1977, 141-45).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_10\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tattoo or <b>hakang</b><i> </i>is also popular among the Tboli. The forearm and chests of the men and the forearms and calves of the women are tattooed with zigzag or geometric and highly stylized animal and human forms. It is believed that the hakang not only enhances one&rsquo;s appearance but also facilitates a person&rsquo;s journey to the afterlife. For a Tboli woman, being fashionable means wearing many earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings for fingers and toes, with her anklets and tresses done in traditional style&mdash;even while working in the fields or doing household chores. Other articles of personal adornment are made of beads, carabao horn, bone, feathers, and seashells, the mother-of-pearl being the favorite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Kalinga women combine the shells with brightly colored antique beads to embellish their skirts. Shell butterflies are also worn by the Kalinga and the Gaddang as ear ornaments. The Bontok use the whole shell as hip ornaments, usually etched with designs similar to those used for body tattoos. The Ifugao circular shell disks with scalloped edges held together with rattan are called <b>ginoto</b><i> </i>and hang as hip ornament next to the bolo. This is often matched by a necklace of flat, square pieces of mother-of-pearl, also strung together in rattan. The Ilongot use shells as part of necklaces and head ornaments. A ceremonial piece made out of the head of a hornbill is likewise decked with small shell pieces serrated at the edges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Bones, and sometimes ivory, are used in making jewelry and other accessories. The <b>rinti</b> bracelets of the Maranao are supposedly made from the bone of the giant fish or whale, which they used to hunt near the Visayan area. Some rings and cosmetic containers are also made of this bone. The Tboli use small bone pieces on wooden ear ornaments that hold their elaborate necklaces in place. The Mandaya wear bracelets similar to the Maranao, with alternating black bands made of black ebony wood. Although carabao horn is very difficult to carve and is seldom used, the Maranao <b>gukom</b>, traditional container for the aromatic beeswax used for massaging the lower lip, is made of carabao horn. The gukom has a beaded train handle topped with another piece of carabao-horn carving. Wild boar&rsquo;s tusks, topped with a small carved sitting human figure, are used by the Ifugao as armlets. Similar tusks are strung together with fine rattan into a necklace for men (Fox 1977, 757-66). Glass and ceramic beads imported from Europe, India, and China as trade items or as legal tender during the colonial period are valuable ornaments. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2364\">Mansaka</a>, a bib-like piece totally made of beads is used as a neckpiece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Something similar but smaller in scale is used by the Tinguian of Abra. The Tboli and the Bagobo use beads more extensively than any other group. Tiny beads are sewn on clothes and bags, and made into armlets, anklets, and belts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Gaddang are extremely fond of beads and use them extravagantly on their clothes and as personal ornaments. Even the men use them on their capes, loincloth, jackets, and hats. The women&rsquo;s blouses, skirts, pouches, hairpieces, and combs are encrusted with beads. The Kalinga and the Tinguian wear armbands that completely cover their forearms with beads up to the elbow. Among the Kalinga are found antique agate and other beads from Chinese sources. Among the Muslim groups, only the Maranao use beads extensively to decorate their silver box, their gukom, and, occasionally, some belts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_11\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In later times, jewelry assumed a purely ornamental character. Due to the demand of the market brought by tourism and migrant settlers, the meaning of traditional jewelry and personal ornaments has changed in time. The sources of materials have also changed, adapting to its availability and scarcity. For example, melted ballpens have been used as alternative to glass beads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The intrusion of Western concepts of beauty and mass-manufactured beauty products has relegated many of these traditions to the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"resiliency\" name=\"resiliency\"></a>Resiliency of Indigenous Traditions</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fortunately, many of the ethnic traditions in weaving, carving, pottery, and metalwork continue to produce articles needed for everyday life as well as for newly developed commercial demands. The burnay jars of Vigan are still in demand for storing food and water, and as decorative objects in gardens and houses. The Tboli tnalak<i> </i>or the dyed abaca cloth is used for bags, folders, cigarette cases, and wall hangings. The Maranao and Maguindanao tubao<i> </i>has become fashionable among students, just as Maranao metalwork (such as kulintang, gadur, kendi) and carvings (such as sarimanok<i> </i>and lakob, and inlaid <b>baul</b>) are popular among foreign and local tourists. Conscious efforts by individuals and groups to revive and experiment with traditions, such as the ikat, have resulted in the revitalization of these traditions with new design concepts. Furthermore, the interest of different cultural communities in each other&rsquo;s artistic traditions has resulted in ingenious mutations. The Cordillera pasiking, for instance, has now been interpreted by the Dumaguete folk and by the Tboli using homegrown materials, while the mat weavers of Basey, Samar, render the designs of the Tausug pis syabit in an outsized mat version. The Tboli and tnalak weavers have worked with Bagobo ikat weavers, transforming textile designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The folk art traditions have also been appropriated by local government units as the primary focus of grand festivals such as the Pahiyas Festival of Lucban and the Higantes Festival of Angono. The singkaban and<i> </i><b>tiniban</b> arches of Bulacan have also been used in art festivals and other celebratory events. NCCA has supported events that celebrate indigenous culture through the Dayaw Festivals. Exhibits dedicated to the importance of the living traditions as symbol of the Filipino identity have been constructed at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a>, Cultural Center of the Philippines, and, at one point, Nayong Pilipino. Scholars and researchers in Philippine art and culture have published books on the different art forms, from the perspective of art studies, cultural studies, Philippine studies, gender studies, and interdisciplinary studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_12\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Finally, in their effort to evolve Filipino themes and idioms in the visual arts, contemporary artists have rediscovered the ethnic traditions and now use them as bases for their creations. Many urban-based artists are collaborating with ethnolinguistic groups or have lived with traditional communities and run workshops among these groups. Thus takes place a lively interchange between the artist and the communities. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2315\">Uma ti Biag</a> </i></b>(Garden of Life) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3824\">Roberto Villanueva</a> of Baguio features the <b><i>dap-ay</i></b>, a spiral space defined by a bamboo fence, derived from a Bontok rice-field design, and dotted with Cordillera-inspired sculptures and stone arrangements to represent a ritual center. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3371\">Paz Abad Santos </a>has used the tnalak and other native fabrics for her tapestries, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3518\">Fil Delacruz</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3541\">Roberto Feleo</a> have taken characters and elements of ethnic culture to make contemporary statements. National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\">Abdulmari Imao</a> has popularized the sarimanok motif as an emblem of Muslim culture in both <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> and sculptural work. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3462\">Imelda Cajipe-Endaya</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\">Brenda Fajardo</a> have appropriated images in traditional culture as tropes for their exploration of tensions between indigenous culture and colonization. Such works underscore the importance of indigenous living traditions in the construction of a national culture and advocate for the diversity of cultures in an increasingly globalized world. An understanding and appreciation of the past and a sensitive and sympathetic attitude toward the events that have altered, shaped, and enriched Philippine culture are important guiding lights in the journey toward self-discovery. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by David Baradas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\"><strong>Alice Guillermo</strong></a>, updated by Cecilia S.

				"value": "There are Filipino cultural communities from the highlands of the Cordilleras to the expanses of the Sulu Sea with a culture antedating the coming of the colonizers and linked with the Austronesian world encompassing Asia and the Pacific. These are the ethnolinguistic groups that traditionally reside in Northern Luzon and Mindanao, and parts of Luzon and the Visayas. Their living traditions are also called <b>indigenous art</b> (referring to a place and locality), <b>ethnic art</b> (referring to ethnicity), and <b>traditional art</b> (referring to art practices of more than one generation), based on categories of identity, language, and longevity of practice. In many ways, these art forms defy Western art categories, and should be seen in integration with the lifeways of the community."

				"value": "Scholars of Philippine culture have introduced various concepts to refer to the art practices that either originated from precolonial times, or developed during the period of colonization&#x2014;both of which continue to persist and are still practiced in the Philippines. &#x201C;<b>People&#x2019;s art</b>&#x201D;<b> </b>refers to art of the Filipino masses, in contrast to the academic and elite connotation of art (de Leon 1981, 1-15). Alternately, &#x201C;<b>sining bayan</b>&#x201D; refers to art forms and practices that exhibit the fusion of indigenous and lowland Christian culture, adapting the use of its material to its immediate environment (Fajardo 2005, 119). Finally, &#x201C;<b>sining lumad</b>&#x201D; refers to the art and culture of communities that resisted the influences of the colonizers and largely maintained their traditional culture linked to Southeast Asia (De La Paz and Flores 1997, 122). Another discourse refers to <b>Philippine Muslim arts</b> as a distinct category to signify the hybridity of the Islamic faith with traditional culture of the <i>lumad</i> (Sakili 2003, 21-49). The commonality of these concepts points to the resiliency of traditional culture to become living traditions in contemporary times, the capacity to resist and/or adapt to the changing physical and social environment, and the belief that such a discourse is a necessary alternative to counteract the Western-dominated understanding of art."

				"value": "The art forms that have developed and transformed in time may be traced to the ancient past and continue to the present as living traditions, adapting to and transforming based on the changing conditions in the physical and social environment. Closely linked with the natural environment, the production of such art is part of everyday life. It creates functional and decorative art forms using the processes of molding, weaving, carving, and casting. In many instances, the traditional belief system of animism permeates these art forms. Spirits are believed to inhabit nature, so that the designs and motifs found in <a href=\"/3/15/2114\">pottery</a>, <a href=\"/3/15/2119\">textile</a> and <a href=\"/3/15/2106\">mat weaving</a>, <a href=\"/3/15/2112\">personal ornamentation</a>, wood carving, and <a href=\"/3/15/2107\">metalcraft</a>, are derived from the natural world. <a href=\"/7/55/469\">Rituals</a> performed to propitiate spirits created a material culture of traditional belief systems in the form of ritual implements and symbolic <a href=\"/3/15/2103\">installations</a>."

				"value": "The ancient cultural sources come from the Oceanic cultures of the Polynesian South Pacific, as in the practice of <a href=\"/3/15/2118\">tattooing</a> and wood carving. In precolonial times, a number of regional cultural traditions made their influence felt. These were the Southeast Asian Malay animist, the Indian Hindu Buddhist, the Chinese, and the Arabic-Islamic strains, which left lasting traces in Filipino culture. Before the 16th century, there were cultural links between southern Japan, the Ryukyus, and the Northern Philippines groups, brought about by ocean currents called &#x201C;culture of the warm currents.&#x201D; The seafarers from both sides exchanged dyestuff, beeswax, horn, and raw cotton, creating similarities of art practices in pottery and weaving (Respicio 2007, 19-21). In time, these various strains did not remain separate but intermeshed. Indigenous wood carving in the Philippines is a local expression of the larger Southeast Asian Malay wood-carving tradition. This is evident especially in the <b>okir</b><i> </i>art of the Muslim <a href=\"/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> and the <a href=\"/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> of Mindanao and Sulu. The Maranao designs of the <b>sarimanok</b>, <b>naga</b>, and <b>pako rabong</b><i>&#x2014;</i>with their repertoire of motifs&#x2014;are related to the designs and motifs of the region. The sarimanok, which is a kingfisherlike bird, usually with a fish in its beak or base, belongs to the region&#x2019;s rich bird imagery derived from <a href=\"/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, myths, and legends, such as the epic of <a href=\"/9/78/1858\">Darangen</a>. It is akin to the Indonesian <b>garuda</b><i> </i>and the Bornean hornbill, which grace house facades and boat prows. In Asian mythologies, birds are symbols of the human spirit and the transcendence of that spirit over matter, and symbols too of the liberation of the individual spirit as it merges with the universal soul. When the Islamic belief took hold in Mindanao in the 13th century in Sulu and spread to the island, the indigenous groups, such as the Tausug and Maranao, fused indigenous culture with Islamic belief, creating art forms that may be interpreted as hybridities in meaning and content. Thus, the sarimanok<i> </i>motif was regarded as Muslim art. Another figurative image in Islamic belief is the <b>burraq</b>, the hybrid half-animal and human, believed to be the vehicle of the Prophet Mohammed on his ascent to heaven. The image is comparable to the sphinx image of Egypt and Syria but, in the context of Muslim Mindanao, became integrated in <b>boras</b><i> </i>mat weaving, <a href=\"/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>, and wood carving (Sakili 2003, 192-97)."

While its meaning derives from epics and myths, it also alludes to Lake Lanao&#x2019;s fertile waters. The naga has the form of an elaborate mythical serpent or dragon with a vigorous S-curve and numerous curvilinear motifs to suggest its scales. The pako rabong is a stylized growing fern with a broad base gracefully tapering upward. The sarimanok and naga are found in the <i>panolong</i>, the extended floor beam, and the interior beams and posts of the large sultan&#x2019;s house called <a href=\"/2/5/229\"><i>torogan</i></a>.

Side panels and boards are also embellished with okir and so too is its <i>tinai a walai </i>central crossbeam.

An understanding and appreciation of the past and a sensitive and sympathetic attitude toward the events that have altered, shaped, and enriched Philippine culture are important guiding lights in the journey toward self-discovery. <span class>&#xA0;</span> "

The native populations were relocated &ldquo;<i>bajo las campanas</i>&rdquo; (under the bells) in a process called <i>reduccion</i>, which intended to bring the converted people to newly founded pueblos or towns under the purview of the religious orders and the secular Spanish government. In these pueblos, the <i>indios</i> (Christianized natives) worked under the supervision of the friars who provided them with European models for iconography and style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Spanish colonizers aimed to replace indigenous culture with one in the image and likeness of Europe. Art became a handmaiden of religion, serving to propagate the Catholic faith and thus support the colonial order at the same time. However, in time, what resulted was not a Western culture but a colonial culture marked by a fusion of indigenous and Western elements. Some years after the image of the Christ Child was offered by Ferdinand Magellan to the rulers of Cebu as a baptismal gift, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, upon his arrival in 1561, found the same image in native garb and adornments, venerated by the populace of Cebu. The image had become transformed in the indigenous belief system and way of life after a few decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A mercantile economy supporting the Spanish colonial officials and government was in place, as the galleon trade plied the route between Manila and Mexico from the 1600s to 1815. As goods flowed into Manila, Chinese participants of the galleon trade were there to teach native artisans techniques and themes of carving. On the one hand, with the galleons came the Mexicans, whose cultural influence on the Filipinos, and vice versa, has until now received scant attention from scholars. Together with Portuguese, Italian, and even Bohemian priests they influenced the practice of the Catholic religion and its manifestations. The influence of the Spanish, Mexican, and other European artworks and styles on Philippine arts may be called Hispanic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the opening of the country to international trade in the mid-19th century, via the opening of the port of Manila in 1834, economic change came with cash-crop agriculture. The new situation enriched the merchants, moneylenders, and the landlords&mdash;mostly Chinese mestizos or half-breeds&mdash;who converted their lands from their traditional produce to the new export crops like sugar, coffee, abaca, hemp, and copra. The quota system was introduced, thereby applying greater pressure on the peasant farmers. The surplus from the cash crops that accrued to the landlords soon gave rise to the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated) class, whose members became the new patrons of the arts. It was the ilustrados who gained access to higher education in local universities and, with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, in foreign shores. Their contact with European culture developed new tastes geared to Western aesthetics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The cash-crop agriculture of the mid-19th century led to a boom in the building of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><i>bahay na bato</i></a>, the mansion of stone and wood that combined indigenous features with classical and baroque elements. For their handsomely furnished interiors, the ilustrados commissioned portraits celebrating their social ascendance and a new identity for the natives. Along with portraiture, the first genre <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> appeared, as did the<i> </i><b>letras y figuras</b><i> </i>(letters and figures) commissioned by the new entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the same period that saw the secularization of painting, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3525\">Damian Domingo</a> opened his Tondo studio as the first art <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">school</a>, the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura. After Domingo&rsquo;s death, the school was reopened under the supervision of the Junta de Comercio, which brought over Spanish art professors from the peninsula. It was through them that the European classical tradition was introduced into the country. Furthermore, the school imported oil paintings and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a> from Europe to serve as models for local students. Products of these schools were painters like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3733\">Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</a>, who by winning top honors at the Madrid Exposition of 1884 proved that Filipinos could hold their own in the world of Western art, thus winning one more point in the Reformists&rsquo; campaign for political equality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period culminated in a tension between the movement for reform, on the one hand, and the push for revolution, on the other. Ideological tensions between the elite and the Filipino masses would continue into the subsequent historical periods in Philippine history. Meanwhile, efforts to fuse seemingly disparate symbolism resulted in an appropriated image in Western art fused with new meanings. In particular, the image of Christ described in the various texts of the<b><i> </i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><i>pasyon</i></a> (Passion of Christ), ritually sung every Holy Week in the Philippines, was possibly reimagined as a revolutionary figure by Filipino revolutionaries like Apolinario de la Cruz aka Hermano Pule, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>, and Macario Sakay. The Filipinized image was dressed in Western-inspired concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The phenomena of indigenizing colonial images may also be seen in the symbology of the Katipunan flag, which was influenced by Masonic beliefs of the West but incorporated the <i>baybayin</i>, or the traditional style of writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>The Hispanic Forms of Visual Arts</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Spanish missionaries embarked on their campaign to Christianize the Filipinos, they harnessed the visual arts to great effect. The colorful pageantry of the Roman Catholic Church helped the new evangelists to win over the natives to the new faith. Religion was thereafter to provide such great impetus for the visual arts that in virtually every art form the sacred aspect became far more developed than the secular, thus continuing the intimate relationship between art and religion long established in ancient Filipino belief systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">Rituals</a> and processions were the first visual aids. From the technologies used in crafting ritual paraphernalia developed the various visual art forms that characterized the Spanish colonial period: sculpture, painting, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a>, fine <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2107\">metalwork</a>, metal casting, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2119\">textile arts</a>, and fiesta decor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"sculpture\" name=\"sculpture\"></a>Sculpture</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of all the arts, sculpture was the most familiar to the Filipinos. The carving of <b>anito</b>, images of the native religion, was replaced by the carving of <b>santos</b>, images of Christ and the saints. Technically, the transition may not have been too difficult, as the Filipinos were already familiar with the ways of wood, but adjustments had to be made on proportion and style. In time, santos tried to take on the iconography of their Western prototypes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">European influence was evident particularly in classical and baroque sculpture and in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> architecture. The classical canons of art prescribed proportion, balance, and harmony in figurative representation marked by serenity and restraint. Classical santos observed the conventional proportion, symmetry, and serene expression. Baroque santos carved in wood and ivory were marked by dynamic, asymmetrical form and emotionalism in expression, with a predominance of spirals and curved lines to suggest movement, as in the highly expressive and polychrome figures of the Spanish sculptors Pedro de Mena and Alonso Cano. The rococo style heightened the decorative tendency in church ornaments: silver <b>ramilletes</b><i> </i>(floral wreaths) for altars and <b>carrozas</b><i> </i>or floats that showed the skill of the silversmith&rsquo;s hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos commissioned by the church were usually large, carved from hardwoods, such as molave, and placed on church facades or altars. The houses of the rich often displayed processional santos like those in the church. Small santos were kept in miniature altarpieces with niches called <b>urnas </b>while others were protected under cylindrical glass globes called <b>virinas</b>. It was the santos of the ordinary folk, however, which displayed a variety of innovations. Many were carved by their owners who ignored Western rules on anatomy and proportion in favor of their own personal preferences. Every so often, santos harked back to earlier carving traditions: they sported large heads that recall the description of <b>anitos</b> in the early 16th-century Cebu (Pigafetta 1969, 42). Aside from these, there were folk santos whose forms and expressions showed more affinity to indigenous sculptural forms, especially the fearsome apotropaic or demon-repelling figures of the Cordilleras. Moreover, rituals usually done for the <b>bulol</b> or traditional wooden deity, such as wiping, perfuming, and smoking of the wood, were also done to images of the Santo Entierro (Dead Christ), thus evoking the importance of the potent dead and the need for propitiation through the performance of rituals. Santos are also popularly referred to as <b>poon</b>, invoking the potency of these images to heal and grant wishes through the performance of a <i>panata</i> or vow, such as touching, wiping, kissing the feet; dressing the image; singing the pasyon<i> </i>chant; and joining religious processions (De La Paz 2011).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To make santos appear more lifelike, they were finished in the process called <b>encarnacion</b>.<i> </i>A coating of gesso, a mixture similar to plaster of paris, was first applied all over the wood to cover cracks and smoothen the surface on which flesh-colored paint was later applied. Lifelike qualities were enhanced by the application of glass eyes and tears, and wigs of human or fiber hair. If a statue was carved with drapery, these were polychromed or painted in various colors. Intricate floral designs were often painted on the gowns. Gold-leaf decoration was also applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from carving whole statues of wood, artists crafted mannequins with wooden heads and hands that were attached to a <b>bastidor</b> or framework body. These bastidor santos were outfitted with gowns of expensive <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">material</a>, elaborately embroidered with gold thread and sequins. Made chiefly for processions, they were mounted on men&rsquo;s shoulders or on carriages and brought around town. After the procession the santos were returned to the church or to the houses of their <i>camareros</i><b> </b>or caretakers, where they were usually kept in huge glass cabinets until the next procession. So much was needed for the maintenance of the santos that earnings from rice fields and other properties were especially set aside for their upkeep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ivory santos deserve special mention. Although the presence of elephants was recorded in Sulu up to the end of the 16th century, ivory was for the most part imported from countries, such as Mozambique, India, and Vietnam. Substitutes for ivory were fishbone and the teeth of the <i>dugong </i>or sea cow. The ivory-carving trade was first assigned to the Chinese, who had in fact begun carving Christian ivory statues in their home country. As 17th-century Philippine ivory santos may be seen today in numbers in Mexico and Spain, it may be surmised that the early images were created mainly for export.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some scholars have proposed that, in view of the absences of Chinese artists from Philippine shores, the Filipinos themselves must have carved great numbers of these ivory santos. The Filipinos learned carving skills from the Chinese. Under the influence of these teachers, they carved in the Chinese manner, creating flat oval faces with heavy eyelids. The slight curve found in many statues was due to the natural curve of the elephant&rsquo;s tusk. This posture became so popular that even santos carved from large blocks of wood were given a similar curve. Another peculiar feature of Philippine ivory carving may be seen on the backs of many 17th-century images of the Virgin Mary: a <b>suksok</b> or tuck at the back of the robes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Santos could also be made of stone, but this material was not as popular as wood. Stone santos seem to have been made exclusively for the church, and most often for their exteriors. Most do not display sophisticated modeling and detail, although the examples in Tumauini, Isabela, and in San Joaquin, Iloilo, suggest a more proficient hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 19th century, miniature tableaux depicting religious scenes became popular. Santos carved in wood or ivory, and clothed in gold, silver, or expensive threads were placed amidst luxuriant settings with blown-glass flora and fauna. The landscape was made luminous with the iridescent wings of the <i>salaginto </i>or beetle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from freestanding images, religious scenes were also carved in relief. Known as <b>relleves</b>,<b> </b>these ranged in size from small plaques hung in houses to the large and heavy ones used to adorn churches. A series of these panels was fitted into altarpieces. As <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/483\"><b>Via Crucis<i> </i></b></a>or Stations of the Cross, they were hung in sequence along the church walls to illustrate the passion and death of Christ on Calvary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After three centuries of religious sculptures, images other than santos were carved. In the second half of the 19th century, the increasing number of businessmen traveling to the Philippines created a market for souvenirs. Particularly popular were the <b>tipos del pais</b>, figures of ordinary people in local costume. When the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura began to include sculpture in its classes in 1879, students began to carve not only tipos del pais but also heads of various Philippine ethnographic types, and genre or scenes from everyday life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from santos and relleves, the Filipinos carved ornaments to embellish the interiors and exteriors of churches, houses, and other buildings. The grandest achievements in this manner are the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/240\"><b>retablos</b></a> or altarpieces, the focal point inside churches. The earliest retablo is found in San Agustin Church in Intramuros, saidto have been carved in 1617 by JuandelosSantos, a native of San Pablo, Laguna. This altarpiece reflects 16th-century Spanish influences, notably in the orderly rows of niches for santos, the strong vertical movement, and the use of ornate motifs reminiscent of the plateresque style, so called because of its resemblance to the intricate silverwork of that era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Later retablos showed baroque influences, albeit modified to native preferences.<strong> </strong>Altar pieces became wider, providing a strong horizontal movement to balance the vertical upward thrust. Flamboyant and swirling vegetal forms and the twisted Solomonic column, based on the pillars believed to have been used in King Solomon&rsquo;s temple, were characteristics of these decorations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the second half of the 18th century, rococo motifs began to be adopted. The most popular one was the <b>rocaille</b> or ornamentation characterized by asymmetric, jagged lines&mdash;which at times resemble rock- or coral-like forms, at other times resemble tongues of fire. However, the retablo with orderly rows of niches, as exemplified by the retablo of San Agustin, was replicated all over the islands, with only the decorations varying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tastes began to change in the 19th century when retablos became more formal and architectural, with very restrained carved decorations. An interesting development may be seen in the Ilocos and a few other regions where retablos of stone and mortar, not of wood, were constructed. Later in the century, a few altarpieces reflected the vogue for gothic revival, manifesting spires and pointed arches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Filipinos&rsquo; mastery of wood carving was reflected not only on retablos but also on such other religious furnishings as pulpits, doors, choir screens, and carrozas. The era&rsquo;s last burst of grandeur was achieved by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a>, who carved the <b>artesonado</b><i> </i>or coffered ceilings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/370\">San Ignacio Church</a> in Intramuros, inaugurated in 1890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">East and West converged as well in santos or holy statues enshrined in church retablos or displayed on private altars. The formal santos for churches crafted under the strict supervision of ecclesiastical authorities followed European aesthetic canons. The statues carved in the classical style followed prescribed proportions for the figure and conveyed the values of restraint and measure, while those showing baroque influence had an emotional, expressionistic character. On the other hand, informal or folk santos drew from the indigenous sculpture styles typified by the angular and squat anitos with round, bulging eyes. Church supervision of religious art existed precisely to prevent the entry of unorthodox elements. Yet it is clear in representations&mdash;for example, of the Holy Trinity depicted as human figures seated together in a row and not according to the prescribed imagery&mdash;that local artisans still managed to do things their way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Wood carving as folk art is also practiced in the Laguna towns of Paete and Pakil, as well as in Betis, Pampanga. Paete wood-carvers have perfected the art of carving santos from native hardwood. After the initial coating of glue and gesso<i> </i>(plaster of paris) to create a nonporous ground, the <b>encarnador </b>(finisher) gives the image a rosy lifelike hue or an ivory finish. A neighboring town, Pakil, is known for its fans and toothpick trees of exquisite wood filigree, while the Betis wood-carvers of Pampanga apply their skills to furniture. Bamboo was also utilized for decorative purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carved facades reflect another aspect of Filipino artistry. Stonecutters worked on adobe, coral stone, volcanic rock, and stucco to delineate figures of saints, floral decorations, and architectural elements. The facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/342\">church in Miag-ao, Iloilo</a>, is a joyful adaptation of classical and rococo motifs. Its pediment highlights San Cristobal dressed in native costume carrying the Christ Child on his shoulder. He clutches a coconut tree and is flanked by guava and palm trees. On the other hand, the facade of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/345\">church of Morong, Rizal</a>, carved by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2689\">Bartolome Palatino</a> of Paete, Laguna, is an exuberant compendium of virtually every classical architectural component and motif. In a lighter vein, the carver&rsquo;s proclivities were expressed in such household items as wooden molds used for making the biscuits to be given away on the feast of San Nicolas de Tolentino. Touches of the carver&rsquo;s art may also be seen in other domestic utensils like coconut graters, clothes presses, and <i>sungka </i>game boards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Philippine revolution of 1896 created the impulse toward the Filipinization of holy images. This is exemplified by the image of the <b><i>Virgen sa Balintawak</i></b> (Virgin in Balintawak), 1900s, of the Aglipayan church, a localized version of Catholicism fused with the spirit of the Philippine revolution (Gealogo 2011). Here the image of Virgin Mary and Child is garbed in peasant clothes called <i>balintawak</i>, thereby constructing the symbol of Inang Bayan (Motherland) calling her children to fight for freedom&mdash;a colonial image completely transformed into a powerful symbol of a new nation. Indigenization, combined with issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and social class, informs the iconography of the <b><i>Virgen sa Balintawak</i></b>, pointing to the manner in which Filipinos appropriated ideas and concepts from the colonizers, for both the visual arts and the Philippine revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"painting\" name=\"painting\"></a>Painting</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For much of the Spanish rule, religious icons were the prevalent form of painting. Paintings of saints and religious scenes were constantly commissioned for churches, <i>conventos</i> or residences of parish priests, monasteries, schools, chapels, and private residences. Although the bulk of the paintings was created for churches and buildings, they could also be found in lowly nipa huts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest extant religious paintings are the late 16th-century frescoes in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/369\">monastery of San Agustin</a> in Intramuros. The paintings on the stone walls of the sacristy are in abstract, strapwork patterns. The frescoes on the stone ceiling of the refectory, probably of a later date, are more floral and depict the initials of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since paintings from Europe and America were understandably scarce, the religious orders took it upon themselves to teach basic artistic skills to their parishioners. As the <i>sangleyes</i> or Chinese immigrants knew how to paint, it was easy for them to learn Western techniques and to imitate what few paintings the friars brought with them from Mexico and Spain. This skill was eventually learned by Filipinos who in effect inherited Chinese and Spanish techniques. Using the Chinese brush, Filipinos began painting exceedingly fine details. For example, the embellishment of initial letters in the medieval manuscripts is echoed in the letters in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2127\"><b><i>Anales Eclesiasticos de Filipinas</i></b></a> (Ecclesiastical Annals of the Philippines), late 16th century, with one letter decorated with figures and scenes of all kinds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipinos copied from Spanish models, but since black-and-white engravings of saints were often the only material from which to gain inspiration, the native artists developed their own color scheme of bright, primary hues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Religious imagery tended to be more Byzantine than baroque in feeling. The subjects were depicted frontally, usually in static postures. A multipoint perspective was used, which made a scene appear to be viewed from above. The size of the personages increased according to their importance in the painting. Christ in a Crucifix ion scene, for example, would dwarf the Roman soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paintings of nonreligious subjects became popular in the 19th century, although secular scenes had already appeared in engravings in the 1730s. Paintings were also used for propaganda purposes, as when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2142\">a series of paintings was commissioned in 1821 to commemorate the victory of Spanish forces over the Ilocano in the Basi Revolt</a>. The artist was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3823\">Esteban Villanueva</a> from Vigan, Ilocos Sur, who interpreted the event in 14 paintings, depicting the gruesome death of the Ilocano rebels, and the class distinctions between the elite and the masses. The paintings also feature symbolisms that convey the portents of nature, thus opening the paintings for alternative interpretation of martyrdom instead of the original intention to warn the public of the price of rebellion (Flores 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As travel to and from the island became easier, a demand for tourist souvenirs arose. Like their counterparts in sculpture, the tipos del pais were much sought-after. Albums showing different native types in their characteristic costumes were painted by various artists. The most popular of these were the series by Damian Domingo, one of the most famous artists of the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the earliest portraits were those of bishops, other Church officials, and founders of religious orders, secular art portraiture gained importance by the beginning of the 19th century, with the rise in fortune of the mestizo and native elite. These new wealthy classes, wishing to document their affluence, commissioned artists to paint their likenesses in all their finery, and luxurious details were not to be missed: their delicate pi&ntilde;a<i> </i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>, the luster of their pearl-encrusted combs, and the glow of their gold <b>tamborin </b>(big round beads). Portraits were also painted on lockets and kept as souvenirs of loved ones. Portraits in the style of <b>miniaturismo</b>, depicting minute details on large canvases, remained popular until the end of the 19th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some of the more important portraitists of the previous century were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3408\">Juan Arceo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3697\">Severino Flavier Pablo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3644\">Antonio Malantic</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3417\">Justiniano Asuncion</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3548\">Simon Flores</a>. These homegrown artists worked in the miniaturist style, so called because it was concerned with recording minutely and meticulously the features of costume, the elaborateness of embroidery, the fineness and transparency of the bodice, the textures of cloth and jewelry. As to the sources of the miniaturist style, the direct influence could have been the miniature portraits from the limner&rsquo;s art in vogue in Europe since the Renaissance. This fashion was introduced in the Philippines where at one time the most valued gift became the miniature portrait of the loved one or of the Virgin or a saint enclosed in a gold locket. A number of portraitists, like Domingo and de la Rosa, also did miniature paintings. The influence could have come directly from Spain alongside the numerous art objects in the period of international trade or from Mexico, where paintings of saints carried incidental still life rendered in painstaking detail. More indirect but nonetheless important sources were the Dutch and Flemish strains in Spanish art since Spain in its imperial heyday extended as far as the Netherlands. Philip II himself was an avid collector of Flemish art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aspecial form of the miniaturist style was the <b>letras y figuras</b><i> </i>of which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3633\">Jose Honorato Lozano</a> was the principal exponent. In this form done in watercolor on brown Manila paper, the letters of the patron&rsquo;s name were painted as genre figures detailing occupations of the period, and were thus valuable as artistic records of the late 19th century. Although the letters were only a few inches high, the details of costume, accessories, and other material features of the setting were painted in remarkable detail. The figures were, moreover, often supplemented with scenes of Manila Bay with its foreign merchant boats anchored at bay, and of the Pasig River and Intramuros, as in Lozano&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2185\"><b><i>Francisco Garcia Ortiz</i></b></a>. In <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2139\"><strong>Balvino Mauricio</strong></a></strong></i></b>, the principal feature is a mansion and its lavishly furnished interiors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the same time period, the British <b><i>Punch </i></b>magazine of the Victorian era featured similar illustrations in which letters, especially those beginning a text, were embellished with figures of all kinds&mdash;humans, animals, and plants. In the British mode, most letters were clearly drawn and the figures served as embellishments, but in the letras y figuras it was the figures themselves that formed the letters, a more clever and skillful accomplishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first formal art school in the country, the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura, establishedin 1823, was headed by Damian Domingo. Closed in 1834, the <i>academia</i> opened again in 1850, this time with professors from Spain. The tendency in the academia was to turn away from miniaturismo and emphasize painting through brushwork. Single-point perspective was introduced wherein a subject was seen from only one point of view. This style, later termed the &ldquo;academic,&rdquo; was gradually favored by the church and the government. Artists commissioned by churches painted icons in this style, but continued to portray their sitter in the miniaturist style, which was preferred by the middle class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under the influence of the academia, other forms of painting, such as everyday scenes, landscapes, and <b>bodegones</b><i> </i>(still lifes), became popular. Among the artists who distinguished themselves in these forms were Simon Flores, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3574\">Lorenzo Guerrero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3748\">Felipe Roxas</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3653\">Felix Martinez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3709\">Paz Paterno</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3708\">Adelaida Paterno</a>. Extant examples include Simon Flores&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2276\"><strong>Primeras Letras</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(First Letters), which brought out the primary role of mothers in child education, and <b><i>Alimentando Pollos</i></b> (Feeding Chickens), which showed a mother and her child feeding chickens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the death of Domingo, the academia was taken over by the Junta de Comercio, which brought over to the country Spanish art professors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3741\">Lorenzo Rocha</a> and Agustin Saez. Through them, the influence of the European Academy made itself felt in the art scene. The Spanish professors introduced classical norms in representation and the academic conventions of rendering and modeling while juxtaposing their subjects to the local environment. Among the pupils of the second academia was Lorenzo Guerrero who later became a teaching assistant. Guerrero furthered landscape and genre painting in the country with such works now known as <b><i>The Water Carrier </i></b>and <b><i>Bride Before a <strong><strong>Mirror</strong></strong></i></b>. Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo had brief stints at the academia. Luna did portraits of his mother and brother Manuel in a character study, <b><i>El Violinista </i></b>(The Violinist). Hidalgo produced tranquil landscapes and delicate portraits. The two artists later chose to pursue their art in Europe. Unlike the homegrown painters, Luna and Hidalgo were not concerned with capturing minute detail in their portrait works. Influenced by late 19th-century Impressionism, they were interested instead in the general aspect of the figure and in the psychological values of portraiture. This can be seen, for instance, in the two artists&rsquo; Chula paintings and in Luna&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2157\">La Bulaque&ntilde;a</a> </i></b>(The Lass from Bulacan), as well as portraits of family members he painted on his last visit to the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Madrid, the expatriate artists Luna and Hidalgo produced masterpieces that showed the tutelage of the European Academy and were approved as entries in academic expositions. They followed contest prescriptions to deal with large-scale works in oil on canvas, their subjects drawn from Greek or Roman antiquity or mythology, following a classical style with room for baroque and romantic strains. In 1884, Luna&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2300\"><strong>Spoliarium</strong></a></strong> </i></b>won the first gold medal in the Madrid Exposition, which also saw Hidalgo garnering a silver medal for his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2319\"><b><i><span style=\"letter-spacing:-.05pt\">Las Virgenes Cristianas Expuestas al Populacho</span></i></b></a> (Christian Virgins Exposed to the Populace). Inspired by Desobry&rsquo;s novel on Roman times, Luna&rsquo;s <b><i>Spoliarium </i></b>had as subject the cruel gladiatorial combats in which Christians and captives from the colonies were pitted with one another or with animals for sport in the arena of the Colosseum. The <i>spoliarium</i> itself was the basement of the Roman Colosseum to which the dying and dead gladiators were dragged after the combat, there to be despoiled and stripped of their last worldly effects by human vultures before their bodies were claimed by loved ones. In Hidalgo&rsquo;s <b><i>Virgenes</i></b><i> <strong>C</strong><b>ristianas</b></i>, Christian women were sold as slaves in the marketplace where they were scrutinized by leering men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"print\" name=\"print\"></a>Print</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Up to the 18th century there were only four printing presses, all located in Manila. The oldest method of printmaking was xylography or woodcut printing, the Chinese printing process using woodblocks that involved cutting the reverse of an image on a plaque of wood. The first books impressed and printed in this method were <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1600\">Doctrina Christiana en Lengua Espa&ntilde;ola y Tagala</a> </i></b>(Christian Doctrine in the Spanish and Tagalog Languages), the <b><i>Doctrina Christiana en Letra y Lengua China </i></b>(The Christian Doctrine in the Chinese Script and Language), and the <b><i>Apologia por la Verdadera Religion </i></b>(In Defense of the True Religion)&mdash;all of which were published by the Dominicans in 1593. The first book featured a woodcut engraving of Santo Domingo de Guzman done by the Chinese convert Juan de Vera. Printing from woodcuts was a popular practice until the 18th century, when copperplate engraving became more widely used. In this method, the reverse image was etched in acid on a copperplate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">All presses were owned by the religious orders; hence most works printed were either religious treatises or prayer books. The engravers illustrated prayer books and literature on the lives of saints. The <b>estampas</b><i> </i>or prints appearing in these publications featured portraits of saints and religious scenes, like the Crucifixion; smaller <b>estampitas</b><i> </i>were also distributed to the townsfolk during feast days. Many of these were later embroidered, framed, and hung on walls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 18th century may be said to be the golden age of Philippine printmaking. The fact that Filipino printmakers then signed their works, and affixed &ldquo;Indus Manil,&rdquo; &ldquo;Indio Tagalo,&rdquo; even &ldquo;Indio Filipino,&rdquo; implies confidence in both their art and ethnic identity. The most important engravers of this period were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3783\">Francisco Suarez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3429\">Nicolas de la Cruz&nbsp;Bagay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3421\">Lorenzo Atlas</a> (previously identified as Laureano but with recent evidence seems to be Laurentius in Latin or Lorenzo in Spanish), and Felipe Sevilla. The art of engraving was highlighted in its use in cartography or mapmaking. Suarez and Bagay&rsquo;s contribution to the first complete map of the Philippines commissioned by Fr Murillo Velarde in 1734 are the scenes of flora and fauna on the map. In 1760, Bagay and Suarez also illustrated the fifth edition of what is regarded as the first pasyon, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5056\">Gaspar Aquino de Belen</a>. Another Atlas, Cipriano, did engravings of a canon, signifying the importance of military might in the 1760s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Copperplate engraving continued up to the 19th century, although by then it had lost much of its vigor. Eventually, it was displaced by the new technology of lithography, a process in which a greasy medium is used to delineate the image on a flat stone and was crucial to the advancement of newspapers and periodicals. The magazines <b><i>La Ilustracion Filipina</i></b>, 1859-60, and <b><i>La Ilustracion del Oriente</i></b>, 1877-78, featured beautiful lithographs. Apparently the most ambitious project using lithography was the printing of the plates of Fr Manuel Blanco&rsquo;s <b><i>Flora de Filipinas</i></b> (Plants of the Philippines) in 1878. Filipinos did not develop lithography as efficiently as they did engraving. Most lithographers during the Spanish period appeared to have been Spaniards and other foreigners. Blanco&rsquo;s <b><i>Flora</i></b> in 1878 had designs made by Filipinos, but with color lithography done in Spain. In contrast to colored lithography, <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a></strong> at its inception developed photographs in black and white.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Photography was introduced to the Philippines in the 1840s. One of the first practitioners were the Spanish photographer Laureano Rodriguez who documented <i>komedya</i> plays. By 1895, Filipino photographer Felix Laureano would publish <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2282\"><b><i><strong>Recuerdo</strong>s de Filipinas</i></b> </a>(Memories of the Philippines) depicting the everyday life at the end of the 19th century (Laureano 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"furniture\" name=\"furniture\"></a>Furniture</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipinos, especially members of the elite, emulated the lifestyle introduced by the Spaniards. In native homes the furniture resembled those used in churches, conventos, and the houses of Spaniards. Furniture during this period may be roughly classified into three, according to function: pieces for storing things in, pieces for resting on, and pieces for laying things on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the earliest pieces for storage was the <b>baul</b>, a wooden chest. Locally made baul reproduced in carvings the intricate markings of tooled Cordovan leather, which was used to cover chests brought in by the galleons. The <b>aparador</b><i> </i>was a large cabinet that had one, two, or even three doors. Huge aparadores stood in church sacristies for storing various utensils and silver ornaments. Smaller aparadores were found in residences, often in the bedrooms. As fortunes rose in the 19th century, aparadores began to sport large mirrors on their doors and elaborate carvings on the crown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An upright chest with two or more drawers was called a <b>comoda</b>, where such things as table linens and small articles were kept. Church sacristies used elongated and bulky chests of drawers called <b>cajonerias</b>, for altar cloths and elaborate priests&rsquo; vestments. The tops of these cajonerias were wide and polished, so that the priest could lay out his chasuble and other accessories as he prepares for mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In virtually every home, one comoda was reserved as the family altar for household santos. Today this piece of furniture is popularly called the <b>mesa altar</b><i> </i>(altar table), although this is a misnomer as it is a cross between a table and a comoda. It usually has two to three large drawers supported on four legs reinforced by a stretcher. Some mesa altar also incorporate long slender drawers for storing candles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the bedroom was the <b>painadora</b>, a dresser or chest of small and large drawers surmounted by a mirror. A more elaborate form of the painadora was the <b>tremor</b>,<i> </i>which features three full-length mirrors, two of which can be adjusted so that the woman could see herself from three angles. Also found in the bedroom was the <b>almario</b>, an interesting example of Filipino adaptation of Spanish imports. Originally used in Spain as a cabinet for weapons and called <b>armario</b>, in the Philippines it referred to a tall, slender, four-posted bedroom rack that stored pillows, mosquito nets, rolled-up mats, and other beddings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At one end of the dining room was at least one <b>platera</b>, a cabinet that displayed the family&rsquo;s porcelain and silver tableware. In the kitchen, food was stored in the <b>paminggalan</b>, a cupboard with shelves and drawers, usually protected by two slatted doors. Finally, hat and cane racks, usually with mirrors, were placed at the entrances to living rooms for the convenience of residents and guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Furniture in the second category were made up of pieces used for resting on, such as chairs and benches, sofas and beds. Chairs came in a variety of forms. The so-called bishops&rsquo; chairs were heavy and elaborately carved, and were located by the main altar of a church for the priest and his assistants. The <b>frailero</b><i> </i>was so named because it was supposed to be wide enough to accommodate a portly friar. The term came from Spain itself, an indication that even there the cliche of the fattened cleric was a popular one. The seats and backs of chairs were often of <b>solihiya</b> or open rattan fretwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Evocative of the tropics was the <b>butaca</b><i> </i>(planter&rsquo;s chair). Its most prominent features were a reclining back and long wide arms that often extended way beyond the front of the seat. This chair, also called <b>silla perezosa</b><i> </i>(lazy chair), was the epitome of relaxation in those days; the sitter could rest his legs up on the long wide arms as he took his afternoon siesta.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Benches, known as <b>bancos</b><i> </i>or <b>kapiyas</b>, were kept on the ground level of the house for visitors and tenants to rest on while waiting to be called upstairs. A popular bench was the <b>gallinera</b>, so-called because the slatted bottom half was supposed to keep roosters while their owners carried on their business with residents of the house. Intricately carved benches were also used in churches. There were no pews then as they are known today. Most of the congregation knelt or stood, following the liturgy. Only the principal citizens were allowed the privilege of sitting on the long benches that were placed along the middle of the nave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Toward the end of the 19th century many living rooms had a sofa popularly known as the <b>mariposa</b>, named after the butterfly shape of its back and derived from the Victorian horsehair sofa. Like chairs, beds were an innovation in the Filipino lifestyle. Unlike Western beds, Filipino beds had sleeping surfaces of woven solihiya, ensuring coolness and comfort for the occupant. Beds were often of the four-poster variety, which was convenient for hanging mosquito nets. In the late 19th century, the more popular four-posters with abundant floral and vegetal motifs were crafted by a Chinese in Binondo, Eduardo Ah Tay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third category was furniture for laying things on. The most important in this group were the tables, among which the dining table was the most noteworthy. Traditionally, Filipinos ate while squatting around the <b>dulang</b>, a very low table. Gradually, Filipinos, particularly the upper class, adopted the higher <b>mesa</b> (table) with matching chairs. Tables for large families were often constructed from wide elongated panels of wood, which could seat up to 36 people. Side tables were known as <b>consolas</b>.<i> </i><b>Escritorios</b><i> </i>(office tables) were outfitted with folding or roll-up desk tops to store paper and other writing materials. In the bedroom were <b>lavaderas</b><i> </i>or tables provided with porcelain wash basins for morning ablutions. Tables were made of wood or marble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine furniture absorbed artistic influences from the different peoples trading with the islands. Many 17th-century pieces manifest touches of Chinese design in the use of dragon heads and ball-and-claw on the feet of tables, chests, and benches. Some pieces are known to have been inlaid with mother-of-pearl, such as the present to the viceroy of Peru. Later 18th-century pieces, especially some mesas altares, exhibit modified and flattened rocaille motifs, reminiscent of rococo. In the 19th century, as trade with England and the United States increased, furniture design began to show influences from French Louis XV to English Victorian styles. The inlaying of furniture with bone had by this time become a specialty of the provinces of Bulacan and Nueva Ecija. At the turn of the century, neo-Gothic pointed arches appeared on such items as door panels for cabinets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\"><a id=\"fine\" name=\"fine\"></a></span></span></span><strong>Fine Metalwork </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">Early Spanish chronicles may have differed in their observations of Filipino customs, but all were unanimous in noting the Filipino love for jewelry. Jewelry making, and goldsmithing in particular, was an ancient practice in the country. Proof of this comes from archaeological excavations all over the country and from 17th-century <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> dictionaries containing a wealth of terms related to the art of goldsmithing, such as techniques, weights and measures, and types of jewelry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One indigenous jewelry technique that flourished during the colonial era was granulation. Minute beads of gold were applied on flat surfaces to form designs, or were soldered together to form larger beads for <b>alukon</b><i> </i>chains, which resembled a vine of that name. Other popular types of gold chains were finely wrought <b>bejuquillo</b>, known since the 16th century; the double-linked flat <b>alpahor </b>or<b> alfajor</b>, which resembles a Spanish pastry; the <b>San Felipe</b>, an alpahor variant mixed with beads; and the <b>tornasol</b>, which was made of double interlinked cut sheets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Very early in their conversion, Filipinos, upon the encouragement of the friars, developed the habit of wearing rosaries and crucifixes around their necks. The habit gave rise to the finest jewelry for personal devotions. The <b>relicario</b>, also called <b>agnos</b>, was a necklace from which dangled a pendant encasing a religious relic. Another popular name for this necklace was <b>tamborin</b>, perhaps because the shape of its pendant resembled a <i>tambor </i>(embroiderer&rsquo;s hoop) or maybe because a kind of frame similar in shape to a tambor was needed to guide the needlelike instruments in twirling the fine gold wire. The tamborin referred as well to filigreed beads used for rosaries. The <b>escapulario</b><i> </i>or <b>kalmin</b><i> </i>was a scapular, a pair of medals worn on the breast and the back. Some escapularios and cross pendants are noteworthy for their intricate, lacelike patterns, incorporating motifs akin to the rococo. A few rare examples resemble thorns or pineapple leaves; hence the term <i>tinik </i>(thorn) or pi&ntilde;a or pineapple. Gold crosses incorporated a variety of materials: tortoiseshell, red coral, ivory, and mother-of-pearl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Not everyone, of course, could afford expensive religious jewelry. The common people developed the tradition of wearing medals with abbreviated Latin inscriptions and relief representations of religious personalities, ranging from the eye of God to San Cristobal. These <b>anting-anting</b><i> </i>(amulets) acquired different forms and various &ldquo;powers.&rdquo; They were said to render the wearer invisible, safe from evil, irresistible to women or immune to bullets. Other amulets eventually took the form of double crucifixes, dwarves, or even animals, such as the crocodile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the advent of the galleon trade, silver began to pour in from Mexico and the Chinese started to settle in Manila. Used to working only with solid gold, the Filipinos learned the techniques of silverwork and gilding introduced by the Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the affluence of Chinese mestizos grew, so did their collection of jewelry. By the 19th century a variety of personal items were being crafted in gold and silver. The upper-class woman nestled a <b>peineta</b><i> </i>(comb) in her hair or used a <b>pantoche</b><i> </i>(pin) to hold her veil in place. From her ears hung <b>criollas</b><i> </i>or <b>aretes</b><i> </i>(hoop earrings), and around her neck was a <b>gargantilla </b>(choker). Her <b>pa&ntilde;uelo</b><i> </i>(shoulder scarf) was pinned together by an <b>alfiler</b><i> </i>(brooch). She wore any number of <b>anillos</b><i> </i>(rings) on her fingers, and <b>pulseras </b>(bracelets) on her wrists. From one wrist dangled the <b>porta abanico</b><i> </i>(fan chain), which kept a fan conveniently near. Tucked into the skirt waist was a<i> </i><b>llavero </b>(keyholder)&mdash;more keys meant more doors and more chests to open, indicating affluence. Even the <i>colchos</i> (slippers) were adorned with silver decorations, and the salakot or headgear studded with silver ornaments. Silver and gold glinted from the <b>baston </b>(walking stick) and the <b>cairel </b>(watch chain) of the upper-class gentleman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Already adept at making jewelry, the goldsmith gradually learned to fashion religious vessels for church use. Chalices and patens, ciboria, monstrances, and other ecclesiastical accessories commonly used silver said to have been melted from Mexican coins. The <i>naveta </i>was a boat-shaped container for the <i>kamanyang </i>or native incense, which was sprinkled into the coals of the <b>incensario</b><i> </i>or censer, for incensing altars and other objects on special occasions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were the <b>candeleros</b><i> </i>(candlestands) in various shapes and sizes, and ramilletes<i> </i>(stylized bouquets) to decorate altars. The <b>lampara</b><i> </i>was a huge lamp suspended by chains from the ceiling, which contained the oil for the sanctuary lamp. Silver sheet&mdash;chased, hammered, and brightly polished&mdash;were mounted on wooden frames to form crosses, tabernacles, <i>guiones</i> (processional standards), altar <i>frontales </i>or flats and panels for the carrozas or processional floats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Patron saints of churches were adorned with gold and silver, usually in the form of <b>coronas </b>(crowns) and <b>aureolas</b><i> </i>(haloes). Around the face of the Virgin Mary fitted a <b>rostrillo</b><i> </i>(facial aureole), while the head of Christ featured three <b>potencias</b><i> </i>or rays signifying the three mental faculties. A near-endless variety of saints&rsquo; personal symbols and accessories were also crafted in silver, including angel wings, boots, staffs, miters, quills, palm leaves, and crowns. Silver <b>ex-votos</b> or tokens in the shape of eyes, noses, lips, limbs, and others were given by devotees to special santos in gratitude for favors granted. This custom continues to this day, decking out the image of Santa Lucia in the town bearing her name in Ilocos Sur. A triumph of the silversmith&rsquo;s craft is the elaborately wrought image of San Diego de Alcantara in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/347\">church of Nagcarlan</a>, Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although the church claimed a large portion of silver for its liturgy, there was enough silver left for domestic purposes. Silver was used for separate trays for <i>buyo </i>and tobacco leaves, both used for chewing betel nut. There were also silver chests, mosquito net holders, perfume burners, and tableware. But perhaps the most flamboyant of these pieces were the <b>paliteras </b>or toothpick trees fashioned into pineapples, dogs, peacocks, and other fanciful shapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"metal\" name=\"metal\"></a>Metal Casting</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The art of metal casting was practiced in foundries, the earliest of which were those found in Intramuros and the port of Cavite. Apart from such metal hardware as muskets, cannons, and galleon fittings, numerous bells were cast to supply the great number of churches rising all over the islands. The oldest known bell in the country, dated 1595 and found in Camalaniugan, Cagayan, displays an archaic form that is more cylindrical than conical. By the end of the 18th century, however, bells had taken on the form familiar today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were at least four kinds of bells. The large <b>campana </b>was hung from a beam and was rung by pulling the clapper against the mouth of the bell. The slightly smaller <b>esquilla</b><i> </i>was rotated, propelled by a heavy wooden yoke attached to the bell&rsquo;s head, which acted as a counterweight. The <b>campanilla </b>(handbell) was rung by an assistant during consecration and other rituals. A series of small bells attached to a <i>rueda </i>(wheel) was heard on festive occasions like Easter and Christmas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 19th century, bell casters began affixing their names on their products. Benito de los Reyes was a bell caster active in the first part of that century. The most prolific was Hilario Sunico, whose foundry began operations in San Nicolas in Manila in 1870. Juan Reina was Sunico&rsquo;s counterpart in Iloilo; he cast what is regarded as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2258\">the country&rsquo;s largest bell in 1878 for the church of Panay</a> in Capiz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Designs for bells usually incorporate the image of the cross with a base as exemplified by a bell in San Carlos, Pangasinan, 1856. It was at this time that the Spanish government went into an offensive against the so-called Moro raids, and Muslim prisoners were captured and incarcerated in Manila and Cagayan, opening the possibility that a Tausug metal caster working in the foundry in Pangasinan may have infused local motifs in his work because the bell&rsquo;s image of the cross features curvilinear motifs that may be interpreted as an <b>okir</b> design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Once in a while, metal casters also produced statues. The most famous of these is that of King Charles IV of Spain, whose statue was cast in 1824 in gratitude for his introduction of a vaccine in the islands in 1805. This statue, now standing againin its original place in front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, was cast by Ambrosio Casas, a Chinese mestizo whose daughter married Damian Domingo, the painter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As in Spain and Latin America, iron grills were cast and used in buildings and homes to secure windows and other openings. However, early examples of grillwork are exceedingly rare because, together with bells, many were melted down in the turbulent 17th and 18th centuries and recast as cannons and other much-needed weapons. The most popular type of grill used for windows is the <b>rejas na buntis</b><i> </i>(pregnant grill), which had a convex curve at the lower half of its form. Finely worked grill doors dated 1866 may be seen in San Agustin Church in Intramuros. The foundry of Hilario&nbsp;Sunico in San Nicolas, Manila, famous for its bells, also crafted iron grills, such as the fanciful ones for the San Ignacio Church in Intramuros done before 1890.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\"><a id=\"textile\" name=\"textile\"></a></span></span></span><strong>Textile Art </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">During the Spanish colonial period, the local fabric that caught the imagination of the Spaniards and other foreigners was the <b>nipis</b>.<i> </i>In the 17th century, the Visayans were described as wearing nipis, which was woven from stalks of the abaca plant, a cousin of the banana. Later the term nipis came to refer to fabrics made from maguey leaves, jusi or raw silk, and the most famous of all, pi&ntilde;a or pineapple leaves. Nipis fabrics were colorfully dyed, striped, or embroidered in white, and made into camisa or shirts for male and female, pa&ntilde;uelos or shoulder scarves, <b>panyo</b><i> </i>or handkerchiefs, altar cloths and articles for religious functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Being a favorite souvenir of foreigners, nipis was introduced to the international market in the late 19th century and captivated Europe and America. Many beautiful pieces of nipis are found in museums and private collections abroad from New York to London and Switzerland.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nipis fabrics were decorated in a number of ways. Stripes and checkerboard patterns were achieved by introducing supplementary threads while weaving at the loom in a technique called <b>sinuksok</b>.<b> Calado </b>or drawn work, achieved by pulling threads to make small perforations, resembled lace. The calado, combined with embroidery, became more popular in late 19th-century Europe as &ldquo;<b>Manila lace</b>.&rdquo; The <b>sombrado </b>technique was achieved by stitching floral patterns cut from white cotton cloth on the reverse side of the transparent fabrics, creating a shadow effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These techniques were passed from generation to generation. They were also taught in schools for girls in large towns all over the country. The embroidery work of these students, involving the use of variously colored cotton threads, as well as gold and silver threads and spangles, was extensively used for priests&rsquo; vestments, santos&rsquo; robes, and altar cloths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"fiesta\" name=\"fiesta\"></a>Fiesta Decor</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An appreciation of Filipino colonial art is incomplete without the mention of the decorations created especially for fiestas of patron saints. Typically, most of these are short-lived, created for the specific occasion or for a short period of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A town celebrating its patron saint&rsquo;s feast day or some other festive occasion, for instance, marks its entrance and its main thoroughfares with bamboo <b>arcos</b><i> </i>(arches) embellished with palm fronds, paper ornaments, <b>pakaskas</b><i> </i>(whittled poles), and intertwined branches. Paper and cloth buntings, called <b>banderitas </b>or <b>banderillas</b>,<i> </i>are strung along poles, trees, and houses. The festive air is enhanced by large papier m&acirc;ch&eacute; figures called <b>higantes</b>, propped up and paraded around town by men hidden inside their hollow structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For the feast of San Isidro, patron saint of farmers, facades of residences in the towns of Lucban and Sariaya in Quezon Province are festooned with <b>kiping</b>, which are thin, colorful, translucent rice wafers shaped like leaves, as well as with vegetables and the other produce of the homeowner&rsquo;s trade. On the feast of San Nicolas de Tolentino, cookies and biscuits bearing the likeness of the saint are given away. This custom, introduced by the Augustinians, recalls the saint&rsquo;s deliverance from sickness with bread given by the Virgin Mary. The women of San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan, wrap their special <i>pastillas </i>or carabao milk confections in sheets of <i>papel de hapon </i>(Japanese paper) of many colors, with &ldquo;tails&rdquo; cut out into intricate lacelike designs of flowers, fruits, greetings, and even women playing harps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In colonial times, the <b>parol</b><i> </i>(lanterns) were brought out during processions to ask deliverance from pestilence or drought. This custom has virtually been lost except in a few towns in the Bicol region. However, the decorative and symbolic role of the parol as the star of Bethlehem during Christmas has survived to this day and has evolved into many imaginative forms using all kinds of materials. The traditional parol was made of colorful translucent papel de hapon glued with rice paste on a light bamboo frame. It was shaped like a five-pointed star and endowed with &ldquo;tails,&rdquo; like a comet, also of papel de hapon. The art of lantern making has been elevated in the huge Christmas lanterns of San Fernando, Pampanga, which are virtual kaleidoscopes of color and movement synchronized to music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The season of Lent ushered in its own set of art forms. The mood was decidedly theatrical, centering on the reenactment of Christ&rsquo;s passion. For the liturgy of Palm Sunday, parishioners waved elaborately plaited palm fronds called <b>palaspas</b>,<i> </i>while the priest led a procession recalling Christ&rsquo;s entry into Jerusalem. The Good Friday observance in Paete, Laguna, is highlighted by the presentation of Christ&rsquo;s suffering and death through a procession of mechanical santos. But the most remarkable Lenten play is that held in various towns on the island of Marinduque. Popularly known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/459\"><i>moriones</i></a>, the play is still presented every Holy Week and features participants wearing painted wooden or papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; masks. Easily the most imaginative masks are those representing Roman centurions called <i>morion</i>. For the tradition of the <i>habulan</i> (run and catch), they walk around town beating together a pair of sticks and chase tourists and townspeople with spears. The story of Longinus is dramatized by morion wearing wooden masks in strong colors to resemble Roman centurions with their towering headdresses. In the Visayas, another center of folk art related to church fiestas is Kalibo in Aklan where the Santo Ni&ntilde;o is honored with the <i>ati-atihan </i>in January. The participants don the most spectacular costumes and headdresses in a combination of feathers, beads, and boar&rsquo;s teeth as in mimicking primitive art, while their bodies are blackened with soot.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fiesta synthesizes in countless ways the legacy of the Spanish colonial period to Filipino art. The grand procession of the fiesta is at once a veritable catalogue of the Filipino&rsquo;s artistic skills; the santo, chiselled by the wood-carver; the vestments, sequined by the embroiderer; the carroza, created by the furniture maker; the silver fittings, hammered by the silversmith; the panels, decorated by the painter; the prayer books, engraved by the printmaker; the masks of higantes, molded by the papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; artist; and the bells and candlesticks, cast by a metalsmith. But the fiesta occasion also provided the subversive space for Katipuneros to meet and mingle in a colonial setting, even under the watchful eyes of the church (Wendt 1998). In Holy Week rituals, the liminal sacred time provided the rationale for momentary inversions of power between the elite and the masses. Thus, the creation of anting-anting or amulets is believed to be possible at this time. Rituals not officially sanctioned by the church flourished and continued to the present, such as the Crucifixion rituals in Cutud, Pampanga, and flagellants of Bulacan. Overall, the continuity of the folk visual arts that developed during the Spanish colonization into contemporary times has been largely due to the adaptive and transformative process of hybridization of culture, which addressed the spiritual and social needs of the Filipino.&nbsp; <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2664\"><strong>Regalado Trota Jose</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice G.

The native populations were relocated &#x201C;<i>bajo las campanas</i>&#x201D; (under the bells) in a process called <i>reduccion</i>, which intended to bring the converted people to newly founded pueblos or towns under the purview of the religious orders and the secular Spanish government. In these pueblos, the <i>indios</i> (Christianized natives) worked under the supervision of the friars who provided them with European models for iconography and style."

Art became a handmaiden of religion, serving to propagate the Catholic faith and thus support the colonial order at the same time. However, in time, what resulted was not a Western culture but a colonial culture marked by a fusion of indigenous and Western elements. Some years after the image of the Christ Child was offered by Ferdinand Magellan to the rulers of Cebu as a baptismal gift, Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, upon his arrival in 1561, found the same image in native garb and adornments, venerated by the populace of Cebu. The image had become transformed in the indigenous belief system and way of life after a few decades."

As goods flowed into Manila, Chinese participants of the galleon trade were there to teach native artisans techniques and themes of carving. On the one hand, with the galleons came the Mexicans, whose cultural influence on the Filipinos, and vice versa, has until now received scant attention from scholars. Together with Portuguese, Italian, and even Bohemian priests they influenced the practice of the Catholic religion and its manifestations. The influence of the Spanish, Mexican, and other European artworks and styles on Philippine arts may be called Hispanic."

The new situation enriched the merchants, moneylenders, and the landlords&#x2014;mostly Chinese mestizos or half-breeds&#x2014;who converted their lands from their traditional produce to the new export crops like sugar, coffee, abaca, hemp, and copra. The quota system was introduced, thereby applying greater pressure on the peasant farmers. The surplus from the cash crops that accrued to the landlords soon gave rise to the <i>ilustrado</i> (educated) class, whose members became the new patrons of the arts. It was the ilustrados who gained access to higher education in local universities and, with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, in foreign shores. Their contact with European culture developed new tastes geared to Western aesthetics."

For their handsomely furnished interiors, the ilustrados commissioned portraits celebrating their social ascendance and a new identity for the natives. Along with portraiture, the first genre <a href=\"/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> appeared, as did the<i> </i><b>letras y figuras</b><i> </i>(letters and figures) commissioned by the new entrepreneurs."

After Domingo&#x2019;s death, the school was reopened under the supervision of the Junta de Comercio, which brought over Spanish art professors from the peninsula. It was through them that the European classical tradition was introduced into the country. Furthermore, the school imported oil paintings and <a href=\"/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a> from Europe to serve as models for local students. Products of these schools were painters like <a href=\"/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> and <a href=\"/3/3/3733\">Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</a>, who by winning top honors at the Madrid Exposition of 1884 proved that Filipinos could hold their own in the world of Western art, thus winning one more point in the Reformists&#x2019; campaign for political equality."

Ideological tensions between the elite and the Filipino masses would continue into the subsequent historical periods in Philippine history. Meanwhile, efforts to fuse seemingly disparate symbolism resulted in an appropriated image in Western art fused with new meanings. In particular, the image of Christ described in the various texts of the<b><i> </i></b><a href=\"/9/73/1558\"><i>pasyon</i></a> (Passion of Christ), ritually sung every Holy Week in the Philippines, was possibly reimagined as a revolutionary figure by Filipino revolutionaries like Apolinario de la Cruz aka Hermano Pule, <a href=\"/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>, and Macario Sakay. The Filipinized image was dressed in Western-inspired concepts of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The phenomena of indigenizing colonial images may also be seen in the symbology of the Katipunan flag, which was influenced by Masonic beliefs of the West but incorporated the <i>baybayin</i>, or the traditional style of writing."

The carving of <b>anito</b>, images of the native religion, was replaced by the carving of <b>santos</b>, images of Christ and the saints. Technically, the transition may not have been too difficult, as the Filipinos were already familiar with the ways of wood, but adjustments had to be made on proportion and style. In time, santos tried to take on the iconography of their Western prototypes."

The classical canons of art prescribed proportion, balance, and harmony in figurative representation marked by serenity and restraint. Classical santos observed the conventional proportion, symmetry, and serene expression. Baroque santos carved in wood and ivory were marked by dynamic, asymmetrical form and emotionalism in expression, with a predominance of spirals and curved lines to suggest movement, as in the highly expressive and polychrome figures of the Spanish sculptors Pedro de Mena and Alonso Cano. The rococo style heightened the decorative tendency in church ornaments: silver <b>ramilletes</b><i> </i>(floral wreaths) for altars and <b>carrozas</b><i> </i>or floats that showed the skill of the silversmith&#x2019;s hand."

				"value": "Santos commissioned by the church were usually large, carved from hardwoods, such as molave, and placed on church facades or altars. The houses of the rich often displayed processional santos like those in the church. Small santos were kept in miniature altarpieces with niches called <b>urnas </b>while others were protected under cylindrical glass globes called <b>virinas</b>. It was the santos of the ordinary folk, however, which displayed a variety of innovations. Many were carved by their owners who ignored Western rules on anatomy and proportion in favor of their own personal preferences. Every so often, santos harked back to earlier carving traditions: they sported large heads that recall the description of <b>anitos</b> in the early 16th-century Cebu (Pigafetta 1969, 42). Aside from these, there were folk santos whose forms and expressions showed more affinity to indigenous sculptural forms, especially the fearsome apotropaic or demon-repelling figures of the Cordilleras. Moreover, rituals usually done for the <b>bulol</b> or traditional wooden deity, such as wiping, perfuming, and smoking of the wood, were also done to images of the Santo Entierro (Dead Christ), thus evoking the importance of the potent dead and the need for propitiation through the performance of rituals. Santos are also popularly referred to as <b>poon</b>, invoking the potency of these images to heal and grant wishes through the performance of a <i>panata</i> or vow, such as touching, wiping, kissing the feet; dressing the image; singing the pasyon<i> </i>chant; and joining religious processions (De La Paz 2011)."

Lifelike qualities were enhanced by the application of glass eyes and tears, and wigs of human or fiber hair. If a statue was carved with drapery, these were polychromed or painted in various colors. Intricate floral designs were often painted on the gowns. Gold-leaf decoration was also applied."

These bastidor santos were outfitted with gowns of expensive <a href=\"/3/16/2121\">material</a>, elaborately embroidered with gold thread and sequins. Made chiefly for processions, they were mounted on men&#x2019;s shoulders or on carriages and brought around town. After the procession the santos were returned to the church or to the houses of their <i>camareros</i><b> </b>or caretakers, where they were usually kept in huge glass cabinets until the next procession. So much was needed for the maintenance of the santos that earnings from rice fields and other properties were especially set aside for their upkeep."

				"value": "Ivory santos deserve special mention. Although the presence of elephants was recorded in Sulu up to the end of the 16th century, ivory was for the most part imported from countries, such as Mozambique, India, and Vietnam. Substitutes for ivory were fishbone and the teeth of the <i>dugong </i>or sea cow. The ivory-carving trade was first assigned to the Chinese, who had in fact begun carving Christian ivory statues in their home country. As 17th-century Philippine ivory santos may be seen today in numbers in Mexico and Spain, it may be surmised that the early images were created mainly for export."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Some scholars have proposed that, in view of the absences of Chinese artists from Philippine shores, the Filipinos themselves must have carved great numbers of these ivory santos. The Filipinos learned carving skills from the Chinese. Under the influence of these teachers, they carved in the Chinese manner, creating flat oval faces with heavy eyelids. The slight curve found in many statues was due to the natural curve of the elephant&#x2019;s tusk. This posture became so popular that even santos carved from large blocks of wood were given a similar curve. Another peculiar feature of Philippine ivory carving may be seen on the backs of many 17th-century images of the Virgin Mary: a <b>suksok</b> or tuck at the back of the robes."

Known as <b>relleves</b>,<b> </b>these ranged in size from small plaques hung in houses to the large and heavy ones used to adorn churches. A series of these panels was fitted into altarpieces. As <a href=\"/7/55/483\"><b>Via Crucis<i> </i></b></a>or Stations of the Cross, they were hung in sequence along the church walls to illustrate the passion and death of Christ on Calvary."

				"value": "After three centuries of religious sculptures, images other than santos were carved. In the second half of the 19th century, the increasing number of businessmen traveling to the Philippines created a market for souvenirs. Particularly popular were the <b>tipos del pais</b>, figures of ordinary people in local costume. When the Academia de Dibujo y Pintura began to include sculpture in its classes in 1879, students began to carve not only tipos del pais but also heads of various Philippine ethnographic types, and genre or scenes from everyday life."

				"value": "Aside from santos and relleves, the Filipinos carved ornaments to embellish the interiors and exteriors of churches, houses, and other buildings. The grandest achievements in this manner are the <a href=\"/2/5/240\"><b>retablos</b></a> or altarpieces, the focal point inside churches. The earliest retablo is found in San Agustin Church in Intramuros, saidto have been carved in 1617 by JuandelosSantos, a native of San Pablo, Laguna. This altarpiece reflects 16th-century Spanish influences, notably in the orderly rows of niches for santos, the strong vertical movement, and the use of ornate motifs reminiscent of the plateresque style, so called because of its resemblance to the intricate silverwork of that era."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Later retablos showed baroque influences, albeit modified to native preferences.<strong> </strong>Altar pieces became wider, providing a strong horizontal movement to balance the vertical upward thrust. Flamboyant and swirling vegetal forms and the twisted Solomonic column, based on the pillars believed to have been used in King Solomon&#x2019;s temple, were characteristics of these decorations."
			},

				"value": "In the second half of the 18th century, rococo motifs began to be adopted. The most popular one was the <b>rocaille</b> or ornamentation characterized by asymmetric, jagged lines&#x2014;which at times resemble rock- or coral-like forms, at other times resemble tongues of fire. However, the retablo with orderly rows of niches, as exemplified by the retablo of San Agustin, was replicated all over the islands, with only the decorations varying."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Tastes began to change in the 19th century when retablos became more formal and architectural, with very restrained carved decorations. An interesting development may be seen in the Ilocos and a few other regions where retablos of stone and mortar, not of wood, were constructed. Later in the century, a few altarpieces reflected the vogue for gothic revival, manifesting spires and pointed arches."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The Filipinos&#x2019; mastery of wood carving was reflected not only on retablos but also on such other religious furnishings as pulpits, doors, choir screens, and carrozas. The era&#x2019;s last burst of grandeur was achieved by <a href=\"/3/3/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a>, who carved the <b>artesonado</b><i> </i>or coffered ceilings of <a href=\"/2/8/370\">San Ignacio Church</a> in Intramuros, inaugurated in 1890."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "East and West converged as well in santos or holy statues enshrined in church retablos or displayed on private altars. The formal santos for churches crafted under the strict supervision of ecclesiastical authorities followed European aesthetic canons. The statues carved in the classical style followed prescribed proportions for the figure and conveyed the values of restraint and measure, while those showing baroque influence had an emotional, expressionistic character. On the other hand, informal or folk santos drew from the indigenous sculpture styles typified by the angular and squat anitos with round, bulging eyes. Church supervision of religious art existed precisely to prevent the entry of unorthodox elements. Yet it is clear in representations&#x2014;for example, of the Holy Trinity depicted as human figures seated together in a row and not according to the prescribed imagery&#x2014;that local artisans still managed to do things their way."

				"value": "Wood carving as folk art is also practiced in the Laguna towns of Paete and Pakil, as well as in Betis, Pampanga. Paete wood-carvers have perfected the art of carving santos from native hardwood. After the initial coating of glue and gesso<i> </i>(plaster of paris) to create a nonporous ground, the <b>encarnador </b>(finisher) gives the image a rosy lifelike hue or an ivory finish. A neighboring town, Pakil, is known for its fans and toothpick trees of exquisite wood filigree, while the Betis wood-carvers of Pampanga apply their skills to furniture. Bamboo was also utilized for decorative purposes."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Carved facades reflect another aspect of Filipino artistry. Stonecutters worked on adobe, coral stone, volcanic rock, and stucco to delineate figures of saints, floral decorations, and architectural elements. The facade of the <a href=\"/2/8/342\">church in Miag-ao, Iloilo</a>, is a joyful adaptation of classical and rococo motifs. Its pediment highlights San Cristobal dressed in native costume carrying the Christ Child on his shoulder. He clutches a coconut tree and is flanked by guava and palm trees. On the other hand, the facade of the <a href=\"/2/8/345\">church of Morong, Rizal</a>, carved by <a href=\"/2/11/2689\">Bartolome Palatino</a> of Paete, Laguna, is an exuberant compendium of virtually every classical architectural component and motif. In a lighter vein, the carver&#x2019;s proclivities were expressed in such household items as wooden molds used for making the biscuits to be given away on the feast of San Nicolas de Tolentino. Touches of the carver&#x2019;s art may also be seen in other domestic utensils like coconut graters, clothes presses, and <i>sungka </i>game boards."

				"value": "The Philippine revolution of 1896 created the impulse toward the Filipinization of holy images. This is exemplified by the image of the <b><i>Virgen sa Balintawak</i></b> (Virgin in Balintawak), 1900s, of the Aglipayan church, a localized version of Catholicism fused with the spirit of the Philippine revolution (Gealogo 2011). Here the image of Virgin Mary and Child is garbed in peasant clothes called <i>balintawak</i>, thereby constructing the symbol of Inang Bayan (Motherland) calling her children to fight for freedom&#x2014;a colonial image completely transformed into a powerful symbol of a new nation. Indigenization, combined with issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and social class, informs the iconography of the <b><i>Virgen sa Balintawak</i></b>, pointing to the manner in which Filipinos appropriated ideas and concepts from the colonizers, for both the visual arts and the Philippine revolution."

As the <i>sangleyes</i> or Chinese immigrants knew how to paint, it was easy for them to learn Western techniques and to imitate what few paintings the friars brought with them from Mexico and Spain. This skill was eventually learned by Filipinos who in effect inherited Chinese and Spanish techniques. Using the Chinese brush, Filipinos began painting exceedingly fine details. For example, the embellishment of initial letters in the medieval manuscripts is echoed in the letters in the <a href=\"/3/82/2127\"><b><i>Anales Eclesiasticos de Filipinas</i></b></a> (Ecclesiastical Annals of the Philippines), late 16th century, with one letter decorated with figures and scenes of all kinds."

Paintings were also used for propaganda purposes, as when <a href=\"/3/82/2142\">a series of paintings was commissioned in 1821 to commemorate the victory of Spanish forces over the Ilocano in the Basi Revolt</a>. The artist was <a href=\"/3/3/3823\">Esteban Villanueva</a> from Vigan, Ilocos Sur, who interpreted the event in 14 paintings, depicting the gruesome death of the Ilocano rebels, and the class distinctions between the elite and the masses. The paintings also feature symbolisms that convey the portents of nature, thus opening the paintings for alternative interpretation of martyrdom instead of the original intention to warn the public of the price of rebellion (Flores 1998)."

These homegrown artists worked in the miniaturist style, so called because it was concerned with recording minutely and meticulously the features of costume, the elaborateness of embroidery, the fineness and transparency of the bodice, the textures of cloth and jewelry. As to the sources of the miniaturist style, the direct influence could have been the miniature portraits from the limner&#x2019;s art in vogue in Europe since the Renaissance. This fashion was introduced in the Philippines where at one time the most valued gift became the miniature portrait of the loved one or of the Virgin or a saint enclosed in a gold locket. A number of portraitists, like Domingo and de la Rosa, also did miniature paintings. The influence could have come directly from Spain alongside the numerous art objects in the period of international trade or from Mexico, where paintings of saints carried incidental still life rendered in painstaking detail. More indirect but nonetheless important sources were the Dutch and Flemish strains in Spanish art since Spain in its imperial heyday extended as far as the Netherlands. Philip II himself was an avid collector of Flemish art."

This style, later termed the &#x201C;academic,&#x201D; was gradually favored by the church and the government.

Through them, the influence of the European Academy made itself felt in the art scene. The Spanish professors introduced classical norms in representation and the academic conventions of rendering and modeling while juxtaposing their subjects to the local environment. Among the pupils of the second academia was Lorenzo Guerrero who later became a teaching assistant. Guerrero furthered landscape and genre painting in the country with such works now known as <b><i>The Water Carrier </i></b>and <b><i>Bride Before a <strong><strong>Mirror</strong></strong></i></b>. Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo had brief stints at the academia. Luna did portraits of his mother and brother Manuel in a character study, <b><i>El Violinista </i></b>(The Violinist). Hidalgo produced tranquil landscapes and delicate portraits. The two artists later chose to pursue their art in Europe. Unlike the homegrown painters, Luna and Hidalgo were not concerned with capturing minute detail in their portrait works. Influenced by late 19th-century Impressionism, they were interested instead in the general aspect of the figure and in the psychological values of portraiture. This can be seen, for instance, in the two artists&#x2019; Chula paintings and in Luna&#x2019;s <b><i><a href=\"/3/82/2157\">La Bulaque&#xF1;a</a> </i></b>(The Lass from Bulacan), as well as portraits of family members he painted on his last visit to the Philippines."

Another popular name for this necklace was <b>tamborin</b>, perhaps because the shape of its pendant resembled a <i>tambor </i>(embroiderer&#x2019;s hoop) or maybe because a kind of frame similar in shape to a tambor was needed to guide the needlelike instruments in twirling the fine gold wire. The tamborin referred as well to filigreed beads used for rosaries. The <b>escapulario</b><i> </i>or <b>kalmin</b><i> </i>was a scapular, a pair of medals worn on the breast and the back. Some escapularios and cross pendants are noteworthy for their intricate, lacelike patterns, incorporating motifs akin to the rococo. A few rare examples resemble thorns or pineapple leaves; hence the term <i>tinik </i>(thorn) or pi&#xF1;a or pineapple. Gold crosses incorporated a variety of materials: tortoiseshell, red coral, ivory, and mother-of-pearl."

The upper-class woman nestled a <b>peineta</b><i> </i>(comb) in her hair or used a <b>pantoche</b><i> </i>(pin) to hold her veil in place. From her ears hung <b>criollas</b><i> </i>or <b>aretes</b><i> </i>(hoop earrings), and around her neck was a <b>gargantilla </b>(choker).

She wore any number of <b>anillos</b><i> </i>(rings) on her fingers, and <b>pulseras </b>(bracelets) on her wrists. From one wrist dangled the <b>porta abanico</b><i> </i>(fan chain), which kept a fan conveniently near. Tucked into the skirt waist was a<i> </i><b>llavero </b>(keyholder)&#x2014;more keys meant more doors and more chests to open, indicating affluence. Even the <i>colchos</i> (slippers) were adorned with silver decorations, and the salakot or headgear studded with silver ornaments.

Silver sheet&#x2014;chased, hammered, and brightly polished&#x2014;were mounted on wooden frames to form crosses, tabernacles, <i>guiones</i> (processional standards), altar <i>frontales </i>or flats and panels for the carrozas or processional floats."

A near-endless variety of saints&#x2019; personal symbols and accessories were also crafted in silver, including angel wings, boots, staffs, miters, quills, palm leaves, and crowns. Silver <b>ex-votos</b> or tokens in the shape of eyes, noses, lips, limbs, and others were given by devotees to special santos in gratitude for favors granted. This custom continues to this day, decking out the image of Santa Lucia in the town bearing her name in Ilocos Sur.

Apart from such metal hardware as muskets, cannons, and galleon fittings, numerous bells were cast to supply the great number of churches rising all over the islands. The oldest known bell in the country, dated 1595 and found in Camalaniugan, Cagayan, displays an archaic form that is more cylindrical than conical. By the end of the 18th century, however, bells had taken on the form familiar today."

The slightly smaller <b>esquilla</b><i> </i>was rotated, propelled by a heavy wooden yoke attached to the bell&#x2019;s head, which acted as a counterweight. The <b>campanilla </b>(handbell) was rung by an assistant during consecration and other rituals.

Juan Reina was Sunico&#x2019;s counterpart in Iloilo; he cast what is regarded as <a href=\"/3/82/2258\">the country&#x2019;s largest bell in 1878 for the church of Panay</a> in Capiz."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Designs for bells usually incorporate the image of the cross with a base as exemplified by a bell in San Carlos, Pangasinan, 1856. It was at this time that the Spanish government went into an offensive against the so-called Moro raids, and Muslim prisoners were captured and incarcerated in Manila and Cagayan, opening the possibility that a Tausug metal caster working in the foundry in Pangasinan may have infused local motifs in his work because the bell&#x2019;s image of the cross features curvilinear motifs that may be interpreted as an <b>okir</b> design."

This statue, now standing againin its original place in front of the <a href=\"/2/8/334\">Manila Cathedral</a>, was cast by Ambrosio Casas, a Chinese mestizo whose daughter married Damian Domingo, the painter."

				"value": "As in Spain and Latin America, iron grills were cast and used in buildings and homes to secure windows and other openings. However, early examples of grillwork are exceedingly rare because, together with bells, many were melted down in the turbulent 17th and 18th centuries and recast as cannons and other much-needed weapons. The most popular type of grill used for windows is the <b>rejas na buntis</b><i> </i>(pregnant grill), which had a convex curve at the lower half of its form. Finely worked grill doors dated 1866 may be seen in San Agustin Church in Intramuros. The foundry of Hilario&#xA0;Sunico in San Nicolas, Manila, famous for its bells, also crafted iron grills, such as the fanciful ones for the San Ignacio Church in Intramuros done before 1890."

Later the term nipis came to refer to fabrics made from maguey leaves, jusi or raw silk, and the most famous of all, pi&#xF1;a or pineapple leaves. Nipis fabrics were colorfully dyed, striped, or embroidered in white, and made into camisa or shirts for male and female, pa&#xF1;uelos or shoulder scarves, <b>panyo</b><i> </i>or handkerchiefs, altar cloths and articles for religious functions."

Stripes and checkerboard patterns were achieved by introducing supplementary threads while weaving at the loom in a technique called <b>sinuksok</b>.<b> Calado </b>or drawn work, achieved by pulling threads to make small perforations, resembled lace. The calado, combined with embroidery, became more popular in late 19th-century Europe as &#x201C;<b>Manila lace</b>.&#x201D; The <b>sombrado </b>technique was achieved by stitching floral patterns cut from white cotton cloth on the reverse side of the transparent fabrics, creating a shadow effect."

On the feast of San Nicolas de Tolentino, cookies and biscuits bearing the likeness of the saint are given away. This custom, introduced by the Augustinians, recalls the saint&#x2019;s deliverance from sickness with bread given by the Virgin Mary. The women of San Miguel de Mayumo, Bulacan, wrap their special <i>pastillas </i>or carabao milk confections in sheets of <i>papel de hapon </i>(Japanese paper) of many colors, with &#x201C;tails&#x201D; cut out into intricate lacelike designs of flowers, fruits, greetings, and even women playing harps."

This custom has virtually been lost except in a few towns in the Bicol region. However, the decorative and symbolic role of the parol as the star of Bethlehem during Christmas has survived to this day and has evolved into many imaginative forms using all kinds of materials. The traditional parol was made of colorful translucent papel de hapon glued with rice paste on a light bamboo frame. It was shaped like a five-pointed star and endowed with &#x201C;tails,&#x201D; like a comet, also of papel de hapon. The art of lantern making has been elevated in the huge Christmas lanterns of San Fernando, Pampanga, which are virtual kaleidoscopes of color and movement synchronized to music."

				"value": "The season of Lent ushered in its own set of art forms. The mood was decidedly theatrical, centering on the reenactment of Christ&#x2019;s passion. For the liturgy of Palm Sunday, parishioners waved elaborately plaited palm fronds called <b>palaspas</b>,<i> </i>while the priest led a procession recalling Christ&#x2019;s entry into Jerusalem. The Good Friday observance in Paete, Laguna, is highlighted by the presentation of Christ&#x2019;s suffering and death through a procession of mechanical santos. But the most remarkable Lenten play is that held in various towns on the island of Marinduque. Popularly known as <a href=\"/7/55/459\"><i>moriones</i></a>, the play is still presented every Holy Week and features participants wearing painted wooden or papier-m&#xE2;ch&#xE9; masks. Easily the most imaginative masks are those representing Roman centurions called <i>morion</i>. For the tradition of the <i>habulan</i> (run and catch), they walk around town beating together a pair of sticks and chase tourists and townspeople with spears. The story of Longinus is dramatized by morion wearing wooden masks in strong colors to resemble Roman centurions with their towering headdresses. In the Visayas, another center of folk art related to church fiestas is Kalibo in Aklan where the Santo Ni&#xF1;o is honored with the <i>ati-atihan </i>in January. The participants don the most spectacular costumes and headdresses in a combination of feathers, beads, and boar&#x2019;s teeth as in mimicking primitive art, while their bodies are blackened with soot."

				"value": "The fiesta synthesizes in countless ways the legacy of the Spanish colonial period to Filipino art. The grand procession of the fiesta is at once a veritable catalogue of the Filipino&#x2019;s artistic skills; the santo, chiselled by the wood-carver; the vestments, sequined by the embroiderer; the carroza, created by the furniture maker; the silver fittings, hammered by the silversmith; the panels, decorated by the painter; the prayer books, engraved by the printmaker; the masks of higantes, molded by the papier-m&#xE2;ch&#xE9; artist; and the bells and candlesticks, cast by a metalsmith. But the fiesta occasion also provided the subversive space for Katipuneros to meet and mingle in a colonial setting, even under the watchful eyes of the church (Wendt 1998). In Holy Week rituals, the liminal sacred time provided the rationale for momentary inversions of power between the elite and the masses. Thus, the creation of anting-anting or amulets is believed to be possible at this time. Rituals not officially sanctioned by the church flourished and continued to the present, such as the Crucifixion rituals in Cutud, Pampanga, and flagellants of Bulacan. Overall, the continuity of the folk visual arts that developed during the Spanish colonization into contemporary times has been largely due to the adaptive and transformative process of hybridization of culture, which addressed the spiritual and social needs of the Filipino.&#xA0; <span class>&#xA0;</span> "

The lack of an official art academy throughout the years 1899-1907, despite an apparent market of art students in Manila, resulted in the opening of the houses of the former academicians as private art <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a>, or else the opening of workshops that trained art pupils. Among these art schools were those opened by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3739\">Vicente Rivera</a> with Francisco Murriel and Balbino Alpaso at 270 Calle Cervantes in 1903; by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3454\">Teodoro Buenaventura</a> on Calle Magdalena, Trozo, in 1905; and by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3416\">Jose Ma. Asuncion</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3843\">Miguel Zaragoza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3551\">Vicente Francisco</a>, and Rafael Enriquez in their house-studios along Calle San Sebastian from 1903 to 1907 (Pilar 1992; Casta&ntilde;eda 1964).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the establishment of an American military government in 1898 and later a civilian executive body called the Philippine Commission headed by Jacob Schurman (1899-1900) and later William Howard Taft (1900-02), peace conditions&mdash;often secured under intense American military surveillance and the suppression of pro-independence aspirations&mdash;returned to Manila and other major cities in Luzon and the Visayas. The Philippine Commission governed the Philippines between 1901 and 1907 by passing laws that overhauled the country&rsquo;s political, economic, and legal systems, to give American colonial rule a semblance of civilian supremacy. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902, passed by the United States (US) Congress, also allowed limited political rights for Filipinos to vote on local officials from <i>presidente municipal</i> (mayor) to provincial governor, in preparation for the election by 1907 of the members of the Philippine Assembly, which would serve as the lower house to complement the Philippine Commission as upper house. Then more importantly, by 1902 the economic policy of the Americans as far as foreign and domestic trade were concerned became less restrictive. These allowed the local economy to expand, causing surplus income to flow, first to the foreign and American-dominated businesses; then to the urban-based big Filipino merchants, mercantile traders, trade laborers, and small-scale businessmen; and then eventually to the rural-based Filipino landlords, agricultural merchants, and farmers. The redistribution of purchased Church lands was undertaken by the Insular Government in 1903 and this freed up property for sale to Filipinos as well as Americans. However, the Americans never let their guard down, taking step to suppress Philippine nationalism, chiefly through laws like the 1901 Sedition Law, the 1902 Brigandage Act, the 1903 Reconcentration Act, and the 1907 Flag Law. In addition, the emphasis on civilizational tutelage through mass education was effected starting with American soldier-teachers coming to the Philippines in 1899, and supplemented by the arrival of civilian educators from the USA aboard the transport <i>U.S.S. Thomas</i> (hence the moniker Thomasites) in 1901. The impact of American-conceived and supervised mass education on Filipino culture and art would thus be assured.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\"><strong>Photography</strong></a> of local subjects by American soldiers was a chief area of visual artistic production during this early period, as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3579\">Harry Harnish</a> Collection of photographs from 1898 to 1907, now at the University of the Philippines (UP) Main Library, attests (Lico 2004). In addition, comprehensive photo-ethnography of indigenous peoples was undertaken in order to &ldquo;frame&rdquo; and &ldquo;prove&rdquo; the primitive and uncivilized nature of Filipinos, to justify continued American occupation and tutelage. This was undertaken between 1902 and 1907 by various photographers under Commissioner Dean Worcester who provided imagery pivotal in the establishment of the 1903 Census, as well as the content of exhibition materials sent to the 1904 Saint Louis World&rsquo;s Fair. Early American expeditions to photograph Filipinos included the Charles Martin expedition to the Cordilleras in 1902 and Daniel Folkmar&rsquo;s ethno-photographic survey in 1903, which classified various Filipinos using the then-accepted pseudoscience of physiognomy (Vergara 1995).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the chief sources for artistic production in this early period of American rule were commissions, sales, and gifts to American administrators and soldiers; and the rise of commercial arts via the opening of new businesses often dominated by American capital of new entrepreneurs&mdash;most of whom served in the Philippine-American War. Local artistic patronage by the <i>principalia</i> (local political elite) and <i>cacique</i> (landlord) classes, as well as the Catholic Church, would suffer a corresponding downturn due to the dislocations of war and economic opportunism by the new colonizers, except in those urban areas where economic recovery (such as in Manila and Cebu) was swift due to American administration. Moreover, the incorporation of massive infusions of American infrastructure, in the form of the planning of new cities like Baguio, the restoration and upgrading of roads and rail networks, and the building of new public works and government buildings, spurred economic development among the local population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Portraits of prominent American administrators, like those of William Howard Taft and Arthur Ferguson, were painted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a> starting 1903. While preparing studies for the <b><i>Death of General Lawton</i></b>, 1903 (destroyed 1945), de la Rosa did <i>plein air</i> (outdoor or in-situ) studies of the riverine environments of Marikina and San Mateo, which are among the first such purely Philippine landscape works done in the 20th century. In Paris, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3733\">Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</a> was commissioned by the Insular Government in 1903 to paint an allegory of the surrender of Philippine sovereignty to the United States in exchange for &ldquo;civilizational tutelage,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2264\"><b><i>Per Pacem et Libertatem</i></b></a> (Through Peace and Liberty), 1904 (destroyed 1945). This <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> and <b><i>Death of General Lawton</i> </b>would be installed in government buildings in Manila by Dec 1907.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a means of self-organizing to take advantage of new economic opportunities of American rule in Manila, various Filipino and Spanish artists based in the Philippines banded together as the Centro de Artistas on 11 Feb 1904. Composed of painters, sculptors, musicians, and writers, the organization set up various public programs for music and literature, while serving the educational needs of students in these various artistic fields. Its officers were the painter-sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3561\">Eulogio Garcia Velarde</a>, president; the engraver Fernando Zamora, vice-president; the painter Cecilio Gloria, treasurer; and the sculptor Juan Flami&ntilde;o, vice-secretary. In order to facilitate the teaching of courses (which were most likely done in ateliers located in the workshops of various maestros), department heads were also appointed: <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3792\">Isabelo Tampinco</a> for Architecture, Manuel Flores for Sculpture, Ciriaco Gaudinez for Silversmithing, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3401\">Toribio Antillon</a> for Painting, and Isidro Roxas for Music<i> </i>(Pilar and Guillermo 1993, 205-6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a means of showcasing the cultural resources of their newly acquired colonies, the American government sent a sizable contingent of Filipino natives to the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition (also known as the Saint Louis World&rsquo;s Fair) to inform and entertain visitors about &ldquo;exotic&rdquo; and &ldquo;primitive&rdquo; culture and customs, sitting them in a &ldquo;Philippine village&rdquo; where regular &ldquo;performances&rdquo; of their &ldquo;native ways,&rdquo; such as the butchering and eating of dogs by the Igorots, were undertaken. There was also a Salon exhibition at the same exposition where recent works by major Filipino artists were sent. Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo sent his <b><i>Per Pacem et Libertatem</i></b>, along with 23 other paintings. His <b><i>El Violinista</i></b> won the grand prize of the competition, while his other works garnered four gold medals, six silvers, four bronzes, and two honorable mentions (Roces 1995, 171-72). Also in the same competition, de la Rosa won gold for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2271\"><b><i>Planting Rice</i></b></a> and bronze for <b><i>Death of General Lawton</i></b> (Pilar in Labrador 2007, 14); while Miguel Zaragoza won a gold medal for <b><i>Portrait of Fr. Jose Guerrero</i></b>, one of the 16 works he sent (Pilar 1992, 23); Vicente Rivera y Mir won a silver medal for <b><i>Fishermen at Bangkusay</i></b> (Pilar 1992, 38); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3688\">Patricio Gaston O&rsquo;Farrell</a> won a bronze medal for <b><i>Portrait of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\"><strong>Juan Luna</strong></a></i></b>; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3721\">Jorge Pineda</a> won honorable mention for <b><i>Las</i> <i>Buyeras</i></b> (Betel-Nut Vendors), out of the six he sent for competition (Pilar 1992, 35).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Commercial lithographic printing made headway in this period, especially under the Carmelo and Bauermann Press, where prints for flyers, posters, waybills, and illustrations were produced. The expansion of initially Spanish, and then English mass-circulation magazines that were extensively pictured and illustrated is also a hallmark of this period, with the inaugural of the American-owned <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5589\"><strong>Philippine Magazine</strong></a></i></b> in 1904, the Spanish-language magazine <b><i>Excelsior</i></b><i> </i>in 1905,<i> </i>and the American-owned <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a> </i></b>in 1905. These gave a platform for Filipino illustrators to reproduce their works in graphic form (Buhain 1998). Among the most active illustrators of this and the subsequent period would be Jorge Pineda, who worked for Carmelo and Bauermann, and is assumed to be the real identity of the nom de plume Makahiya, chief illustrator of the satirical weekly magazine <b><i>Lipang <strong>Kala</strong>baw</i></b>, whose first issue came out on 27 Jul 1907 (Roces and McCoy 1985, 8-9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The nationalist commemoration of fallen heroes, and the ideals of the Katipunan revolution, was also represented in the visual arts even at this period of aggressive American censorship, in prints like <b><i>Filipinos Ilustres</i></b>, and in monuments. In Feb 1899, the first Rizal Monument in the Philippines was completed at Daet, Camarines Norte. In the form of a three-sided short pylon on a square base and unadorned by figurative statuary, it antedated the <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2284\">Rizal Monument</a> </em></strong>at Luneta by 14 years, and contained Masonic elements executed by a local sculptor, Sanz (Sarion 2011). In 1903, a monument featuring concrete busts of Rizal, Mabini, and Bonifacio was completed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3638\">Mariano Madri&ntilde;an</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3457\">Jose Caancan</a> at Paete, Laguna (Casta&ntilde;eda 1964, 98). In 1905, the first concrete full-figure <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a> of a revolutionary figure was undertaken by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3655\">Ramon Martinez</a> at Balintawak, titled <b><i>Homenaje del Pueblo Filipino a los Heroes del &rsquo;96 </i></b>(Tribute of the Filipino People to the Heroes of &rsquo;96) aka <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2136\"><b><i>Cry of Balintawak</i></b></a>. This is the figure of a shouting Katipunero striding forward, carrying a flag and a bolo. This statue, which is often assumed to be a portrait of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>, was moved to the UP Diliman campus in 1967.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In scenic painting, the two Filipino apprentices of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3386\">Cesare Alberoni</a>&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2715\">Juan Abelardo</a> and Tomas Antillon&mdash;did <i>telon </i>backdrops and sets for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><i>sarsuwela</i></a> plays at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a>, aside from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a> interior decorations in central and southern Luzon that petered out in this period due to the challenges posed by American Protestant evangelization, the redistribution of Church lands by the Insular Government, and the rise of Gregorio Aglipay&rsquo;s Iglesia Filipina Independiente (Philippine Independent Church).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"assembly\" name=\"assembly\"></a>The Philippine Assembly Period (1907-35) </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the inauguration of the Philippine Assembly in Dec 1907, the initial steps toward political autonomy were taken. The Philippine Commission&rsquo;s composition was also changed to include more prominent Filipinos like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a>, Ignacio Villamor, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5569\">Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera</a>. The local leadership under Sergio Osme&ntilde;a, Manuel L. Quezon, Manuel Roxas, and Elpidio Quirino would also be established via the Philippine Assembly in 1907, leading to the development of a century-long &ldquo;cacique democracy&rdquo; ruled by landed or professional Filipino elites (Anderson 1988). Military control of the countryside was still under American supervision, but more active deployment of the Philippine Constabulary ensured that fewer numbers of American troops were required, except for areas in Mindanao where armed resistance was still serious. Economic progress and the expansion of the American-dominated colonial civil service was emphasized between 1908 and 1913 under Republican-appointed governor-generals like James Francis Smith and William Cameron Forbes. But by the time of Democrat US President Woodrow Wilson (1913-20), the insular bureaucracy was extensively Filipinized under Gov-Gen Francis B. Harrison. A return of Republican-appointed governor-generals in the 1920s produced frictions with the elite, which led to a resurgence of nationalism but also to economic advances among the upper class facilitated through economic &ldquo;special relations&rdquo; and favorable American import quotas. By the early 1930s, during the early years of Democrat US President Franklin D. Roosevelt&rsquo;s administration, discussions about Philippine independence were extensively undertaken as the United States received a series of missions from the Philippines. The Tydings-McDuffee Law, passed by the US Congress in 1934, allowed the transition to full independence via the establishment of a Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, as well as the drafting of a new constitution. The period between 1907 and 1935 is thus a vital time of transition from a colony to a republic, in which patterns of governance, economic development, acculturation, and artistic production would become set for decades to come. Crucially, it was in this period that nativism became a catchword for nationalist aspiration, and lowland cacique culture began to be seen as a fundamental marker of Filipino identity. Modernization was also the key hallmark across various economic and cultural areas from the 1910s to the 1930s, which led to the academic realism of de la Rosa and Amorsolo becoming outmoded, and producing the first stirrings of Modern Art under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>. These stylistic transitions figured more prominently in the public eye through the flourishing of the design of reliefs and statuary in public monuments and public buildings, and the interior decoration of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/245\">movie theaters</a>, public buildings, and schools. The two major stylistic movements from the West, Art Nouveau (1907-24) and Art Deco (1925-50), were to find abundant articulation through the use of design motifs. These included the whiplash, floral-and-vine themes, and the sinuousness of sculpted bodies for Art Nouveau; and the rhythmic diagonal lines, cubistic compositions, geometric patterns, and the rigid anatomies of Art Deco. The American propensity for neoclassicism combined with the Beaux-Arts and City Beautiful Movements as encoded through the Federal Style also served to influence Philippine public art with a formality and allegorical representation that were seen plentifully in Manila and other provincial capitals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Initially, the convening of the Philippine Assembly allowed the opportunity for advocates to reopen the classical academia under American suzerainty. Act 1870, which incorporated the University of the Philippines in 1908, was enacted. Through the lobbying of Pedro Paterno, it included the formation of the Escuela de Bellas Artes (School of Fine Arts) as a unit of the university. This opened on 18 Jun 1909 in the house-studio of Rafael Enriquez on Calle San Sebastian (now R. Hidalgo St), Quiapo. Also in 1908, an organization called the Asociacion Internacional de Artistas de Manila (International Association of Manila Artists) was formed. This Manila-based circle of Filipino and foreign artists was composed of Jose Ma. Asuncion, Teodoro Buenaventura, Armando Camps, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3551\">Vicente Francisco</a>, Agusto Fuster, Antonio Garcia Granda, Patricio Gaston O&rsquo;Farrell, Joaquin Ma. Herrer, Henry T. Levy, Jorge Pineda, Vicente Rivera y Mir, Luis Viejo, and Miguel Zaragoza, with Rafael Enriquez as their titular head (Pilar in Labrador 2007, 82). The organization was set up to sponsor a major exhibition at the Bazaar Filipino in Escolta, timed to coincide with the port call of the US Navy&rsquo;s Pacific squadron in Manila in Nov-Dec 1908. The exhibition included works of all the members of the association, as well as those by Luna and Hidalgo. At the exhibition&rsquo;s competition, Vicente Rivera y Mir and Patricio Gaston O&rsquo;Farrell won first prizes for <b><i>El Sue&ntilde;o Dorado</i></b><i> </i>(The Golden Dream) and <b><i>Portrait of Marie Blocquel Vda. de O&rsquo;Farrell</i></b>, respectively; while Teodoro Buenaventura, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3711\">Ramon Peralta</a>, Jorge Pineda, and a young <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> received second prizes. With the opening of the UP Escuela de Bellas Artes under Enriquez, former members of the Escuela Superior were also hired as new faculty. They initially included Jose Ma. Asuncion (who also served as its founding college secretary), Teodoro Buenaventura, Vicente Francisco, Antonio Garcia, Joaquin Ma. Herrer, Vicente Rivera, and Miguel Zaragoza. Fabian de la Rosa left for a pensionado scholarship to Europe in 1908-10, and upon returning also joined the faculty. Enriquez would continue serving as the director until 1925. Enriquez would be replaced by de la Rosa, who would serve as director until his own retirement in 1935. The first batch of students graduated in 1914, composed of Doroteo Abaya (painting), Fernando Amorsolo (painting), Domingo Celis (painting), Tomas Culliel (engraving), Horacio Reyes (sculpture), and Narciso Reyes (painting). In 1935, when the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3811\">UP School of Fine Arts</a> (the Spanish name was Anglicized by the 1920s) faculty posed for a group photo in its new quarters at Villamor Hall, UP Padre Faura, its faculty included Fabian de la Rosa, Ambrocio Morales, Ramon Peralta, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>, Fernando Amorsolo, Toribio Hererra, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3665\">Irineo Miranda</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3397\">Pablo Amorsolo</a>, Teodoro Buenaventura, and Vicente Rivera (Roces 1975; Casta&ntilde;eda 1964; Pilar 1992; Labrador 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from UP, a major venue for the development of the visual arts was the annual Manila Carnival, started in Feb 1908 and held until 1938 at the Luneta. A combination of a temporary theme park, beauty pageant, concert ground, trade fair, and exhibition venue, the Manila Carnival was the Insular Government&rsquo;s way of pacifying the colonial urban citizenry with spectacle and the display of plenty from the various provinces. Designing posters and print paraphernalia for the Manila Carnival was a highly prestigious commission, and artists like Jorge Pineda and Fernando Amorsolo established their popular reputations via this venue. Patricio Gaston O&rsquo;Farrell, who participated as a painter as well as a commercial exhibitor, won art prizes at the carnivals of 1921, 1922, and 1927, aside from a prize for a patented coconut oil product in 1934. Private commissions for sculptures from the 1910s to the 1930s consisted primarily of funerary sculptures for tombs and mausoleums. The Palma Tomb at North Cemetery was designed by Guillermo Tolentino in 1915. Tolentino also did several funerary sculptural projects in Laguna from 1918 to 1919 under contractor Tomas Zamora. Tabletop sculptures for elite patrons was another, less accessible market. Wood-carvers of academic genre subjects like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3681\">Graciano Nepomuceno</a> were the most sought-after sculptors, particularly of farming scenes and native sports like <b><i>Sipa</i></b>, undated, as well as scenes from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"> </a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></a> </strong> </strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Touch Me Not) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></strong></a> </i></b><i> </i>(Subversion). Another prominent sculptor was Vidal Tampinco. Tolentino&rsquo;s bronze <b><i>Filipinas Bound</i></b> showcases the classical realism of his studies of Roman classic figuration (Casta&ntilde;eda 1964; Paras-Perez 1976; Pilar 1992).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The emergence of cacique<i>-</i>dominated local elite also allowed for a renewal of political-economic relations with the Church, which now depended upon the infusion of new capital investments and patrons under the new Filipino elite dispensation. This resulted in the opening up of Filipino capital to such areas as the purchase of former friar lands as dispensed by the Insular Government in 1904, and the continuation and expansion of principalia patronage via the <b>carrozas</b> and church decorations to newer generations of Filipino upper-middle class. Thus despite the loss of state sponsorship, religious painting and sculpture under the Catholic Church continued to thrive from 1910 to 1930 due to the rise of upper-middle-class incomes (which viewed owning carroza-mounted <b>santos</b> as an important social status indicator) and the renewal of a mainly Filipino-run Church with American bishops presiding. Besides rural examples&mdash;like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3771\">Juan Senson</a> and Pedro Pi&ntilde;on&rsquo;s painted or sculpted icons in Angono, or the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3426\">Canuto Avila</a>&ndash;Raymundo Francia church ceiling commissions in Bohol and Cebu&mdash;the Manila-based <b>santeros</b> or icon carvers for wooden and/or ivory santos<i> </i>carried atop elaborately festooned carrozas<i> </i>during religious processions continued production, primarily from workshops in Quiapo and Santa Cruz. Those of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3819\">Maximo Vicente</a> and Graciano Nepomuceno were the most famous, with Vicente doing the prewar carroza of the La Naval de Manila and Nepomuceno doing the <b><i>Tercera Caida</i></b> (Third Fall) of the Potenciano family of Bi&ntilde;an, Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Through the Philippine Commission via Act 203 in 1901, monumental sculpture and public art received a boost with the inauguration of the <b><i>Rizal Monument</i></b> at the Luneta on 30 Dec 1913. This was designed by Swiss sculptor Richard Kissling who won second prize in the competition but, unlike the no-show winner, Italian sculptor Carlos Nicoli, was able to post the performance bond. The monument, whose design was titled <b><i>Motto Stella</i></b>, contained a sculptural tableau with Rizal as focal point. Rizal&rsquo;s figure faces west to Manila Bay with genre figures to its sides, and a large sheaf of bananas at its rear. A sloping base leads to its central pylon embedded with three stars. <b><i>Motto Stella</i></b><i> </i>inspired sculptors from around the country to reproduce Kissling&rsquo;s design of the bronze statue of Rizal wearing an overcoat and carrying a book in one hand. These translations of Kissling&rsquo;s design used reinforced concrete in the public plazas of towns and cities throughout the 1910s to the 1930s. Among the more notable examples of these are the <b><i>Rizal Monuments</i></b> of Baliwag, Bulacan; Sorsogon, Sorsogon; Carcar City; and Naga City. Used to decorate public buildings, schools, and plazas in the 1910s to the 1920s, the demand for busts of Rizal and other heroic figures, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo del Pilar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>, and Gregorio del Pilar, constituted a market that energized the sculptors of Santa Cruz and Quiapo, Manila, particularly the workshops of Ramon Martinez, Eulogio Garcia, and Vidal Tampinco, with assistants coming from the faculty and graduates of the UP Escuela de Bellas Artes. Among the latter were Ambrocio Morales, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3538\">Severino Fabie</a>, V. Barrientos, and Guillermo Tolentino. Similarly, when the new public structures in Manila, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>&rsquo;s Jones Bridge (1917, destroyed 1945) and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a> (1925, destroyed 1945), or the new UP Campus along Padre Faura were being finished from 1925 to 1935, their sculptural facade and pedestal designs required sculptors versed in using reinforced concrete. Ramon Martinez sculpted the allegorical figures titled <b><i>La Madre Filipina</i></b> (Filipino Mother) on the monumental socles of the Jones Bridge. These are currently found at the Rizal Park and the Manila Court of Appeals Building. Vidal Tampinco designed the sculptural program at the Legislative Building, particularly the allegorical figures at the central pediment. On the other hand, Vicente Francisco undertook the sculptural program of UP Padre Faura&rsquo;s Quadrangle from 1925 to 1930, with pedestaled works titled <b><i>Education and Youth</i></b>,<b><i> Agriculture</i></b>,<i> </i>and <b><i>Law</i></b>. In 1935, Guillermo Tolentino would decorate the podium of UP Padre Faura&rsquo;s Villamor Hall with the statues titled <b><i>Painting</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Music</i></b> (Lico 2008, 282-87).<i> </i>All this public ornamentation was undertaken using the Beaux Arts style. In 1927-29, the Italian migrant sculptor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3670\">Francesco Monti</a> undertook the sculptural program at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> using an Art Deco style, as demonstrated in the famed veiled dancers on its cornice, and <b><i>Adam</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Eve</i> </b>at the main staircase. Monti also designed the sculptural facade of the old Meralco Building along San Marcelino St (demolished 2014), and the series of saints at the cornice of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Main Building. In 1931, the <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2150\"><strong>Bonifacio Monument</strong></a></strong> </i></b> by Tolentino was unveiled at Grace Park, Caloocan. It had a sculptural tableau that featured the events from 1872, such as the execution of Fathers Jose Burgos, Jacinto Zamora, and Mariano Gomez or the GomBurZa, to the 1896 Katipunan Revolution, with Bonifacio at its head flanked by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5393\">Emilio Jacinto</a> and other revolutionaries. Tolentino&rsquo;s sculptural focus on revolutionary sacrifice and martyrdom would be complemented with the unveiling on 30 Nov 1935 of the reinforced concrete statue titled<b> <i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2240\"><strong>Oblation</strong></a></strong> </i></b> at the UP Padre Faura Quadrangle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The repatriation from Europe of artworks by Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo (who died in 1913) would also occur in this period. Many of their works would either be kept by their heirs, which was the case for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2671\">Andres Luna de San Pedro</a>, who himself was a successful architect, or end up in the hands of private collectors, chief among them Alfonso T. Ongpin, a pioneering connoisseur and art dealer in the 1930s (Galang 1939).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the area of scenography and interior painting, Juan Abelardo, Ramon Peralta, Toribio Antillon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3395\">Emilio Alvero</a> were engaged for commissions to decorate prominent homes with paintings executed on walls and ceilings. In particular, Alvero was famed as a master of the <b>bodegon</b>, or still life painting. His bodegon paintings on the walls of the 1911 renovated house of Gen Antonio Bautista in Malolos are some of the few remaining works attributed to him. Outside Manila, the church interior muralists based in Cebu, such as Raymundo Francia and Canuto Avila, once more decorated church ceilings throughout Cebu and Bohol from 1920 to 1941. In Angono, the devotional paintings of Juan Senson, and santo<i> </i>statuary by Pedro Pi&ntilde;on continued to be generated for local consumption from the 1900s to the mid-1920s; while next-generation Angono natives, like the UP-educated Moises Villaluz, worked in the Laguna Lake area of Los Ba&ntilde;os. In 1929, Fernando Amorsolo was commissioned to paint two murals for the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, <b><i>Music </i></b>and <b><i>Dance</i></b>. The results bore a combination of his academic style of dramatic chiaroscuro contrasts, as well as an increasing focus on traditional ethnographic motifs and precolonial imagery.<i> </i>In the early 1930s, the designs of American muralist Eugene Francis Savage became a major influence in the works of emerging painters like Enrique J. L. Ruiz, who studied under Savage at Yale University. Ruiz decorated several theaters in Manila and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> using the Savage style and displayed two panels of the same style at the 1934 Manila Carnival (Casta&ntilde;eda 1964; Roces 1975; Savellon and Abaquita 2004; Saguinsin 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In landscape painting, the works of the elderly Teodoro Buenaventura, who continued to paint rural landscapes in the academic tradition, would be supplemented by that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3399\">Isidro Ancheta</a>. Ancheta was known for pioneering a mass-production method of landscape painting to sell to tourists in the 1930s, while Ramon Peralta painted historical subjects like <b><i>Llegado de Magallanes a Cebu</i></b>, or nationalistic themes like <b><i>Tirad Pass</i></b>. Juan Abelardo also did landscapes in addition to interiors, mostly around San Miguel de Mayumo and Sibul (Casta&ntilde;eda 1964, 79-84). From the mid-1920s to the 1930s, Miguel Zaragoza, Patricio Gaston O&rsquo;Farrell, and Jorge Pineda would return to landscape painting as a means of self-fulfillment, using an academic style akin to the plein air painting of the Barbizon School. In addition, seascapes became an increasing area of concern, as the early works of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3466\">Alfredo Carmelo</a> from 1935 onward would prove. As early as 1916, post-Impressionist landscapes of the Marikina River area were already being painted by Juan Arellano. However, this early modernist rendering of Philippine landscape would not expand until the arrival from studies abroad by Victorio Edades in 1928 and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3631\">Diosdado Lorenzo</a> in 1935.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Portraiture continued to be an important field in both painting and sculpture. Rafael Enriquez is among the more prominent painting portraitists, though only an oil portrait of Jose Rizal from 1927, the year of his death, is now known to survive. It now hangs at the office of the UP president. Among Fabian de la Rosa&rsquo;s portraits of prominent politicians were those of Gen Leonard Wood, 1910; Woodrow Wilson, 1913; William Atkinson Jones, undated; and Manuel and Aurora Aragon Quezon, 1927. Among the next generation after de la Rosa, it was the dominant influence of Fernando Amorsolo in painting that could be seen in portraiture from the mid-1910s to the mid-1930s. Among Amorsolo&rsquo;s early portraits is that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2181\">Fernanda de Jesus</a>, 1915, in which the ideal of the rural lass, carrying a bamboo tray full of flowers, signals a transformation of the austerely formal academic realist depiction to a softer, more organic rendering of nature, humanity, and sunlight. The academic tradition of darkened backgrounds, light streaming upon the sitter as if suddenly illuminated by a camera flash, could still be seen in Amorsolo portraits like <b><i>Portrait of a Katipunero</i></b>,<i> </i>1917, and <b><i>Portrait of Mrs. Sonia Rifkin</i></b>,<i> </i>1930. But in others&mdash;such as his famed portrait of his first wife, Salud Jorge, 1920 (destroyed in 1945); <b><i>Portrait of Juanita Esten</i></b>, 1927; and in particular, <b><i>Portrait of Felicing Tirona</i></b>, 1935&mdash;light has become a more dominant element. Native costume and the rural outdoors, in the case of the Tirona portrait, also become major indicators of Filipino national affiliation (Casta&ntilde;eda 1984; Roces 1975; Amorsolo and Pilar<b> </b>2008).<i> </i></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This period is especially noted for the dramatic expansion of genre scenes in painting. Fabian de la Rosa and Jorge Pineda started this trend with their scenes of farmers planting rice, local craftspeople like lantern makers and hat makers working at their trade, and the playing of local games. By the early 1920s, this would be expanded via the work of Amorsolo, who returned from his pensionado grant to Spain and the United States. Amorsolo&rsquo;s 1921 and 1924 versions of <b><i>Planting Rice</i> </b>and the 1922 and 1925 versions of <b><i><strong><strong>Harvest</strong></strong> Time in <strong><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></strong> </i></b><i> </i>demonstrated a shift from de la Rosa&rsquo;s use of subtle lighting and demure figuration set in the far countryside to that which privileged an increasing emphasis on physical virility, sensuality, and the dramatic illumination of tropical sunlight set in the suburbs of Manila. The multiple versions of these themes, where subtle variations of composition and lighting set them apart from one another, were harbingers of the enormous and consistent output of Amorsolo as a rural genre painter. His economic and stylistic dominance were assured via his popularity among foreign collectors in international exhibitions, such as the one mounted in Art Center Gallery in New York City, 1925; the Grand Central Art Gallery, also in New York City, 1929; and the Paris Exposition Coloniale Internationale, 1931. By the early 1930s, the dominance of Amorsolo&rsquo;s genre paintings created two approaches among the practice of his so-called conservative followers. One was characterized by the disavowal of the formula of brightly lit rural genre scenes, and instead focusing on an earlier style associated with Fabian de la Rosa; while the second imitated Amorsolo to satisfy the large public demand for this kind of rural genre painting. Among proponents of the first would count Fernando&rsquo;s younger brother Pablo Amorsolo, who would decorate the Ocampo mansion in Quiapo with historical murals characterized by an illustrational hard-edged line similarly used by pre-Raphaelite artists. Among proponents of the second approach were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3712\">Jose Pereira</a>, Irineo Miranda, Severino Fabie, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3559\">Antonio Llamas Garcia</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3467\">Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda</a>, whose paintings all bore similarities to Amorsolo&rsquo;s subjects and themes. The works of these artists, alongside of their mentors like Vicente Rivera, Toribio Herrera, and Jorge Pineda, would constitute the mass market of idyllic genre paintings of contented farmers, peaceful pictures of the countryside, and generic scenes of farming and fishing communities that would be labeled &ldquo;conservative&rdquo; in the years to come (Casta&ntilde;eda 1964; Roces 1975; Pilar 1992).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The expansion of print capitalism in the country, manifested in both Spanish and English language weekly magazines like <b><i>Lipang Kalabaw</i></b>,<i> <b>Philippines Free Press</b></i>, and <b><i>El Renacimiento</i></b>, or dailies like <b><i>The Independent</i></b>, also resulted in more opportunities to do illustration work for editorial cartoons and cover feature artworks. Besides Pineda aka Makahiya, other famous illustrators of the period 1908-35 would include Jose Pereira for <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> and Fernando Amorsolo for <b><i>The Independent</i></b>. The nature of their illustration work was informed by their academic training: those of Makahiya appeared as graphic versions of accomplished paintings where commentaries were telegraphed at the bottom; those of Amorsolo were crisp, concise characterizations of major figures who were prominently featured, often devoid of background detailing, and featured small balloon-encased texts; while Pereira maximized the space of the illustration with deeply crosshatched chiaroscuro contrasts, the main figures dominating the space, and bold-faced texts wrapped in cubistic balloons. Starting from the mid-1930s, they would be joined by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3593\">Esmeraldo Izon</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a>. Besides weeklies, special print illustrations also beckoned. The most famous is Guillermo Tolentino&rsquo;s <b><i>Filipinos Ilustres</i></b> (Illustrious Filipinos), 1911, a fictive group portrait of the heroes and martyrs of the Katipunan revolution. This was translated into a lithograph by Pineda and printed by Carmelo and Bauermann. Commercial design for corporate products was also a prominent area of visual art that bloomed in this period. Fernando Amorsolo was a dominant practitioner from 1916 to 1925 by virtue of his art directorship of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/349\">Pacific Commercial Company</a>, and responsible for designing various ads, such as the famous Ginebra San Miguel label <b><i>Markang Demonyo</i></b><i> </i>(Mark of the Demon), 1917, and that of Ivory soap. In book illustration, both Fernando and Pablo Amorsolo would also be favored for their depictions of country life, folktales and proverbs, and historical episodes, particularly in <b><i>The Philippine Reader</i></b> series by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5546\">Camilo Osias</a>, first published in 1932 (Paras-Perez 1976; McCoy and Roces 1985; Ca&ntilde;ete 2012, 142; Amorsolo and Pilar 2008).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In Dec 1928, Victorio C. Edades, then recently returned from his studies at the University of Washington, mounted a solo exhibition at the Columbian Club in Manila. The expressionistic colors and renditions of his American period works as seen in <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2156\"><strong>The Builders</strong></a></strong> </i></b><i> </i>and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2298\"><strong>The Sketch</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1928, unleashed a barrage of criticism leveled by conservative art critics like Ariston Estrada. Conversely, he was supported by pro-modernist writers like the artist Gregorio Paredes (Reyes 1989). In particular, <b><i>The Builders</i></b><i> </i>elicited negative comments because of its brutalist and distorted depiction of human laborers in a stone quarry or construction site. The emphasis on formal composition, with the mural&rsquo;s distribution of human laborers and stones set as interlocking pieces of shapes and hues of light and dark like a cubic, thickly painted jigsaw puzzle ignoring singular perspective and naturalistic anatomy, alienated a public accustomed to the academic fantasy of rural genres that successive generations of artists from Fabian de la Rosa to Fernando Amorsolo popularized.<i> </i>In 1934, Edades formed a group called the Triumvirate, composed of himself, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>, to execute mural commissions using an Art Deco/modernist style for projects by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>. This included <b><i>Rising Philippines</i></b>, 1934 (destroyed 1945), which decorated the lobby of the Capitol Theater in Escolta. This was a pioneering Philippine Modern mural design that utilized multiple perspectives and a flat tapestry-like design inspired from both American Regionalist as well as Mexican Social Realist murals. Dominated by a figure of a woman in white representing the Philippines, ascending vertically from the lower left to upper right of the canvas, <b><i>Rising Philippines</i></b> legitimized the claims of artistic ascendancy among Edades&rsquo;s circle, which was confirmed via the commissioned paintings of elite clients like the Rufino family and Pres Manuel L. Quezon, whose mansion on Roberts St, Pasay, was decorated by the Triumvirate. Another collaborative work is <b><i>Mother Nature&rsquo;s Bounty</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1935, which shows the developing concern of artists for planar composition dominated by curvilinear lines and organic planes. Of the three, it would be Carlos Francisco, called Botong, who would develop the visuality of Philippine Modern Art through muralism and a renewed focus on historical episodes, as well as rural genre. The latter is poignantly demonstrated in his undated <b><i>Angelus</i></b>. Two events in 1935 also strengthened the modernists&rsquo; hand in their developing discursive drive to supplant the conservatives: first, the opening of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3810\">UST School of Fine Arts</a> at Sampaloc, with Edades as its director, and Ocampo and Francisco among its pioneering faculty; and second, the arrival of Diosdado Lorenzo from his studies in Italy. Lorenzo brought with him a thickly impastoed palette inspired by encounters with the Italian Macchiaioli School. Lorenzo&rsquo;s 1935 solo exhibit at the Philippine Columbian Club was, by contrast, well received for his depiction of rural scenes and portraits using this technique (Kalaw-Ledesma and Guerrero 1981; Ty-Navarro 1985; Guillermo 1986, 2009; Reyes 1989; Flores 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"commonwealth\" name=\"commonwealth\"></a>The Philippine Commonwealth Period (1936-41)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the proclamation of the Philippine Commonwealth Republic on 15 Nov 1935 under Pres Manuel L. Quezon and Vice Pres Sergio Osme&ntilde;a Sr, the 10-year countdown toward full Philippine independence began. Although governance, jurisprudence, and legislation were now exclusively held by Filipinos, foreign policy and national defense were still American spheres of concern, subject to final decisions from Washington. The outlines of a cacique<i> </i>democracy had already been fleshed out in the previous two decades since the Philippine Assembly period, but its negative effects on the countryside began to be felt as landlords began to impose exorbitant harvest quotas on planters as peasants and landless farmers agitated for genuine land reform (Kerkvliet 1979). Agricultural revolts, such as the May 1935 Sakdalista Revolt, had already agitated the countryside. Nonetheless, the special relations quota of cash crops and the gold exports to the USA had financially kept the upper middle class afloat to an extent that this blinded them to increasing class inequalities. Tensions over Japan&rsquo;s increasingly assertive military expansionism also required the mobilization of Filipinos under Gen Douglas MacArthur to form the bulk of the US Army Forces in the Far East in 1941. Comforted by a false sense of security provided by the Americans, the Filipino elite and upper middle class consumed vast amounts of imported goods, and were also increasingly open to modern ideas on art&mdash;or at least those legitimated in the USA, like Regionalism and Mexican Social Realism. The Jazz Moderne phase of Art Deco, with its streamlined &ldquo;steamship&rdquo; aesthetics, became a popular style that was translated into <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> design (notably, Juan Nakpil&rsquo;s <b><i>Ambassador Chair</i></b> for Puyat &amp; Sons), fashion, and industrial design. Despite this mania for international trends, the nativist national cultural movement gained full steam with the dominance of Jorge Bocobo as UP president (1935-39) and later education secretary (1939-41). This was particularly made manifest in the pioneering documentation of Philippine traditional and folk art by UP-based scholars like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes</a> (later Mrs Aquino), as well as the decision to categorically make Filipino the national language heavily drawing from Tagalog as linguistic base. This was a move affirmed by Quezon in 1937.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was the combination of Modernism with nativism that saw the development of a hybrid genre subject, the modernist depiction of native women. Victorio Edades&rsquo;s <b><i>Bulul at Babae</i></b><i> </i>(Bulul and Woman), undated, and Galo B. Ocampo&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2154\"><strong>Brown Madonna</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1938, are typical of this movement. Both espouse post-Impressionist and Expressionist techniques such as the use of blocklike brown-skinned figures as seen in the works of Paul Gauguin, alongside the employment of a series of curvilinear patterns that flatten into tapestry-like designs. Even in scenic painting, the modernist influence could be seen in the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3522\">Vicente Alvarez Dizon</a>. In <b><i>After the Day&rsquo;s Toil</i></b>, 1938, he used smooth curvilinear lines and flattened planes. This was Dizon&rsquo;s Yale University master&rsquo;s thesis under Eugene Savage. This work won first prize at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition at San Francisco. Francisco&rsquo;s two murals for the UST Main Building, jointly titled <b><i>Introduction of Christianity in the Philippines</i></b>,<i> </i>1939-40, favors an even flatter use of planar surface. While thematic emphasis is placed on the human figures, they are interrelated with background elements via the introduction of a flowing series of curved lines, a visual feature that would become prominent in Botong&rsquo;s works in the years to come. The increasing debates between conservatives and moderns also began in the period between 1934 and 1939 in various weekly journals and newsletters. This was a consequence of the initial debates following Edades&rsquo;s 1928 solo exhibition at the Philippine Columbian Club, where his Expressionist paintings were derided by critics like Ariston Estrada for being &ldquo;ugly&rdquo; and &ldquo;not fit to be seen by children and women in the family way.&rdquo; Edades fought back with articles asserting that Modernism was a natural progression from Classical Art of the Greeks and Romans, while Conservatism was simply content to repeat the academic formulas of the 19th century. Edades would be joined by Galo B. Ocampo in 1935 and would receive support from such writers as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5462\">Salvador P. Lopez</a> (who defended the peasantry depictions of Galo Ocampo, Edades, and Carlos Francisco in a pioneering article about proletarian art in the Philippines) and the Veronicans, which included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3686\">Hernando Ruiz Ocampo</a>, the latter inspired by the Triumvirate to paint his own proletarian period paintings. This circle of avant-garde writers that met at the Ivory Tower caf&eacute; on Herran St would foster an intelligentsia that was sympathetic to Modernism in the years to come (Casta&ntilde;eda 1964; Ty-Navarro 1985; Pilar 1992; Amorsolo and Pilar<i> </i>2008).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">However, the dominance of Fernando Amorsolo as the premiere painter of the Commonwealth period would be confirmed by his 1936 official portrait of President Quezon, as well as portraits of other major figures like US Resident Commissioner Paul McNutt and Executive Secretary Jorge Vargas. It would also be at this time that the followers of Amorsolo, such as Ramon Peralta, Irineo Miranda, and Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda, would expand upon the visual language of genre works through their specialization on specific subject matter: for Miranda, persons in contemporary dress and situations; for Casta&ntilde;eda and Peralta, rural landscape. Starting in the early 1940s, they would be joined by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3768\">Simon Saulog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3555\">Miguel Galvez</a>, Elias Laxa, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3630\">Crispin Lopez</a>, whose works catered to both elite collectors like Jorge Vargas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5036\">Aurelio Alvero</a>, as well as foreign tourists thronging Manila at the eve of war. These artists would form the nucleus of the conservative painters who would confront the modernists in the postwar period. At the time, their studios and shops were still distributed in a loose constellation starting from Quiapo, Santa Cruz, San Nicolas, and Intramuros all the way to Tondo.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was now up to a second generation of artists schooled by Edades, Ocampo, and Francisco at UST to propel the discursive shift further. They would work in parallel to Lorenzo, Edades, and Ocampo at the short-lived <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3420\">Atelier of Modern Art</a> (1938-41). In 1939, confident that enough artists had taken up Modernism as their aesthetic lodestone via their training at the Atelier of Modern Art (yet apparently without consulting the individuals named), Edades declared the existence of the Thirteen Moderns of Philippine Art. They were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3464\">Arsenio Capili</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3487\">Bonifacio Cristobal</a>, Demetrio Diego, Edades himself, Carlos V. Francisco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, Diosdado Lorenzo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3640\">Anita Magsaysay (<i>n&eacute;e </i>Ho)</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, Galo B. Ocampo, Hernando R. Ocampo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3703\">Jose Pardo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\">Ricarte Puruganan</a>. The closing of the Atelier of Modern Art after the first Japanese air attacks on Manila on 8 Dec 1941 would end the prewar stage of Philippine Modernism. The verbal confrontations would be recapitulated after World War II (Bautista 1992; Guillermo 2009; Ca&ntilde;ete 1999).&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Reuben Ramas Ca&ntilde;ete</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"related\" name=\"related\"></a>Related Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\" target=\"_self\">Painting and Related Forms</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\" target=\"_self\">Sculpture</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3509\">Fabian de la Rosa</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3530\">Victorio Edades</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3685\">Galo Ocampo</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V.

				"value": "With the establishment of an American military government in 1898 and later a civilian executive body called the Philippine Commission headed by Jacob Schurman (1899-1900) and later William Howard Taft (1900-02), peace conditions&#x2014;often secured under intense American military surveillance and the suppression of pro-independence aspirations&#x2014;returned to Manila and other major cities in Luzon and the Visayas. The Philippine Commission governed the Philippines between 1901 and 1907 by passing laws that overhauled the country&#x2019;s political, economic, and legal systems, to give American colonial rule a semblance of civilian supremacy. The Philippine Organic Act of 1902, passed by the United States (US) Congress, also allowed limited political rights for Filipinos to vote on local officials from <i>presidente municipal</i> (mayor) to provincial governor, in preparation for the election by 1907 of the members of the Philippine Assembly, which would serve as the lower house to complement the Philippine Commission as upper house. Then more importantly, by 1902 the economic policy of the Americans as far as foreign and domestic trade were concerned became less restrictive. These allowed the local economy to expand, causing surplus income to flow, first to the foreign and American-dominated businesses; then to the urban-based big Filipino merchants, mercantile traders, trade laborers, and small-scale businessmen; and then eventually to the rural-based Filipino landlords, agricultural merchants, and farmers. The redistribution of purchased Church lands was undertaken by the Insular Government in 1903 and this freed up property for sale to Filipinos as well as Americans. However, the Americans never let their guard down, taking step to suppress Philippine nationalism, chiefly through laws like the 1901 Sedition Law, the 1902 Brigandage Act, the 1903 Reconcentration Act, and the 1907 Flag Law. In addition, the emphasis on civilizational tutelage through mass education was effected starting with American soldier-teachers coming to the Philippines in 1899, and supplemented by the arrival of civilian educators from the USA aboard the transport <i>U.S.S. Thomas</i> (hence the moniker Thomasites) in 1901. The impact of American-conceived and supervised mass education on Filipino culture and art would thus be assured."

In addition, comprehensive photo-ethnography of indigenous peoples was undertaken in order to &#x201C;frame&#x201D; and &#x201C;prove&#x201D; the primitive and uncivilized nature of Filipinos, to justify continued American occupation and tutelage. This was undertaken between 1902 and 1907 by various photographers under Commissioner Dean Worcester who provided imagery pivotal in the establishment of the 1903 Census, as well as the content of exhibition materials sent to the 1904 Saint Louis World&#x2019;s Fair. Early American expeditions to photograph Filipinos included the Charles Martin expedition to the Cordilleras in 1902 and Daniel Folkmar&#x2019;s ethno-photographic survey in 1903, which classified various Filipinos using the then-accepted pseudoscience of physiognomy (Vergara 1995)."

Local artistic patronage by the <i>principalia</i> (local political elite) and <i>cacique</i> (landlord) classes, as well as the Catholic Church, would suffer a corresponding downturn due to the dislocations of war and economic opportunism by the new colonizers, except in those urban areas where economic recovery (such as in Manila and Cebu) was swift due to American administration. Moreover, the incorporation of massive infusions of American infrastructure, in the form of the planning of new cities like Baguio, the restoration and upgrading of roads and rail networks, and the building of new public works and government buildings, spurred economic development among the local population."

				"value": "With the inauguration of the Philippine Assembly in Dec 1907, the initial steps toward political autonomy were taken. The Philippine Commission&#x2019;s composition was also changed to include more prominent Filipinos like <a href=\"/9/80/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a>, Ignacio Villamor, and <a href=\"/9/9/5569\">Trinidad H. Pardo de Tavera</a>. The local leadership under Sergio Osme&#xF1;a, Manuel L. Quezon, Manuel Roxas, and Elpidio Quirino would also be established via the Philippine Assembly in 1907, leading to the development of a century-long &#x201C;cacique democracy&#x201D; ruled by landed or professional Filipino elites (Anderson 1988). Military control of the countryside was still under American supervision, but more active deployment of the Philippine Constabulary ensured that fewer numbers of American troops were required, except for areas in Mindanao where armed resistance was still serious. Economic progress and the expansion of the American-dominated colonial civil service was emphasized between 1908 and 1913 under Republican-appointed governor-generals like James Francis Smith and William Cameron Forbes. But by the time of Democrat US President Woodrow Wilson (1913-20), the insular bureaucracy was extensively Filipinized under Gov-Gen Francis B. Harrison. A return of Republican-appointed governor-generals in the 1920s produced frictions with the elite, which led to a resurgence of nationalism but also to economic advances among the upper class facilitated through economic &#x201C;special relations&#x201D; and favorable American import quotas. By the early 1930s, during the early years of Democrat US President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x2019;s administration, discussions about Philippine independence were extensively undertaken as the United States received a series of missions from the Philippines. The Tydings-McDuffee Law, passed by the US Congress in 1934, allowed the transition to full independence via the establishment of a Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, as well as the drafting of a new constitution. The period between 1907 and 1935 is thus a vital time of transition from a colony to a republic, in which patterns of governance, economic development, acculturation, and artistic production would become set for decades to come. Crucially, it was in this period that nativism became a catchword for nationalist aspiration, and lowland cacique culture began to be seen as a fundamental marker of Filipino identity. Modernization was also the key hallmark across various economic and cultural areas from the 1910s to the 1930s, which led to the academic realism of de la Rosa and Amorsolo becoming outmoded, and producing the first stirrings of Modern Art under <a href=\"/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>. These stylistic transitions figured more prominently in the public eye through the flourishing of the design of reliefs and statuary in public monuments and public buildings, and the interior decoration of <a href=\"/2/5/245\">movie theaters</a>, public buildings, and schools. The two major stylistic movements from the West, Art Nouveau (1907-24) and Art Deco (1925-50), were to find abundant articulation through the use of design motifs. These included the whiplash, floral-and-vine themes, and the sinuousness of sculpted bodies for Art Nouveau; and the rhythmic diagonal lines, cubistic compositions, geometric patterns, and the rigid anatomies of Art Deco. The American propensity for neoclassicism combined with the Beaux-Arts and City Beautiful Movements as encoded through the Federal Style also served to influence Philippine public art with a formality and allegorical representation that were seen plentifully in Manila and other provincial capitals."

Act 1870, which incorporated the University of the Philippines in 1908, was enacted. Through the lobbying of Pedro Paterno, it included the formation of the Escuela de Bellas Artes (School of Fine Arts) as a unit of the university. This opened on 18 Jun 1909 in the house-studio of Rafael Enriquez on Calle San Sebastian (now R. Hidalgo St), Quiapo. Also in 1908, an organization called the Asociacion Internacional de Artistas de Manila (International Association of Manila Artists) was formed. This Manila-based circle of Filipino and foreign artists was composed of Jose Ma. Asuncion, Teodoro Buenaventura, Armando Camps, <a href=\"/3/3/3551\">Vicente Francisco</a>, Agusto Fuster, Antonio Garcia Granda, Patricio Gaston O&#x2019;Farrell, Joaquin Ma. Herrer, Henry T. Levy, Jorge Pineda, Vicente Rivera y Mir, Luis Viejo, and Miguel Zaragoza, with Rafael Enriquez as their titular head (Pilar in Labrador 2007, 82). The organization was set up to sponsor a major exhibition at the Bazaar Filipino in Escolta, timed to coincide with the port call of the US Navy&#x2019;s Pacific squadron in Manila in Nov-Dec 1908. The exhibition included works of all the members of the association, as well as those by Luna and Hidalgo. At the exhibition&#x2019;s competition, Vicente Rivera y Mir and Patricio Gaston O&#x2019;Farrell won first prizes for <b><i>El Sue&#xF1;o Dorado</i></b><i> </i>(The Golden Dream) and <b><i>Portrait of Marie Blocquel Vda. de O&#x2019;Farrell</i></b>, respectively; while Teodoro Buenaventura, <a href=\"/3/17/3711\">Ramon Peralta</a>, Jorge Pineda, and a young <a href=\"/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> received second prizes. With the opening of the UP Escuela de Bellas Artes under Enriquez, former members of the Escuela Superior were also hired as new faculty. They initially included Jose Ma. Asuncion (who also served as its founding college secretary), Teodoro Buenaventura, Vicente Francisco, Antonio Garcia, Joaquin Ma. Herrer, Vicente Rivera, and Miguel Zaragoza. Fabian de la Rosa left for a pensionado scholarship to Europe in 1908-10, and upon returning also joined the faculty. Enriquez would continue serving as the director until 1925. Enriquez would be replaced by de la Rosa, who would serve as director until his own retirement in 1935. The first batch of students graduated in 1914, composed of Doroteo Abaya (painting), Fernando Amorsolo (painting), Domingo Celis (painting), Tomas Culliel (engraving), Horacio Reyes (sculpture), and Narciso Reyes (painting). In 1935, when the <a href=\"/3/3/3811\">UP School of Fine Arts</a> (the Spanish name was Anglicized by the 1920s) faculty posed for a group photo in its new quarters at Villamor Hall, UP Padre Faura, its faculty included Fabian de la Rosa, Ambrocio Morales, Ramon Peralta, <a href=\"/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>, Fernando Amorsolo, Toribio Hererra, <a href=\"/3/17/3665\">Irineo Miranda</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3397\">Pablo Amorsolo</a>, Teodoro Buenaventura, and Vicente Rivera (Roces 1975; Casta&#xF1;eda 1964; Pilar 1992; Labrador 2007)."

A combination of a temporary theme park, beauty pageant, concert ground, trade fair, and exhibition venue, the Manila Carnival was the Insular Government&#x2019;s way of pacifying the colonial urban citizenry with spectacle and the display of plenty from the various provinces. Designing posters and print paraphernalia for the Manila Carnival was a highly prestigious commission, and artists like Jorge Pineda and Fernando Amorsolo established their popular reputations via this venue. Patricio Gaston O&#x2019;Farrell, who participated as a painter as well as a commercial exhibitor, won art prizes at the carnivals of 1921, 1922, and 1927, aside from a prize for a patented coconut oil product in 1934. Private commissions for sculptures from the 1910s to the 1930s consisted primarily of funerary sculptures for tombs and mausoleums. The Palma Tomb at North Cemetery was designed by Guillermo Tolentino in 1915. Tolentino also did several funerary sculptural projects in Laguna from 1918 to 1919 under contractor Tomas Zamora. Tabletop sculptures for elite patrons was another, less accessible market. Wood-carvers of academic genre subjects like <a href=\"/3/17/3681\">Graciano Nepomuceno</a> were the most sought-after sculptors, particularly of farming scenes and native sports like <b><i>Sipa</i></b>, undated, as well as scenes from <a href=\"/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&#x2019;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"/9/77/1781\"> </a><strong><a href=\"/9/77/1781\"><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></a> </strong> </strong> </i></b><i> </i>(Touch Me Not) and <b><i><a href=\"/9/77/1734\"><strong><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></strong></a> </i></b><i> </i>(Subversion). Another prominent sculptor was Vidal Tampinco. Tolentino&#x2019;s bronze <b><i>Filipinas Bound</i></b> showcases the classical realism of his studies of Roman classic figuration (Casta&#xF1;eda 1964; Paras-Perez 1976; Pilar 1992)."

Thus despite the loss of state sponsorship, religious painting and sculpture under the Catholic Church continued to thrive from 1910 to 1930 due to the rise of upper-middle-class incomes (which viewed owning carroza-mounted <b>santos</b> as an important social status indicator) and the renewal of a mainly Filipino-run Church with American bishops presiding.

				"value": "Through the Philippine Commission via Act 203 in 1901, monumental sculpture and public art received a boost with the inauguration of the <b><i>Rizal Monument</i></b> at the Luneta on 30 Dec 1913. This was designed by Swiss sculptor Richard Kissling who won second prize in the competition but, unlike the no-show winner, Italian sculptor Carlos Nicoli, was able to post the performance bond. The monument, whose design was titled <b><i>Motto Stella</i></b>, contained a sculptural tableau with Rizal as focal point. Rizal&#x2019;s figure faces west to Manila Bay with genre figures to its sides, and a large sheaf of bananas at its rear. A sloping base leads to its central pylon embedded with three stars. <b><i>Motto Stella</i></b><i> </i>inspired sculptors from around the country to reproduce Kissling&#x2019;s design of the bronze statue of Rizal wearing an overcoat and carrying a book in one hand. These translations of Kissling&#x2019;s design used reinforced concrete in the public plazas of towns and cities throughout the 1910s to the 1930s. Among the more notable examples of these are the <b><i>Rizal Monuments</i></b> of Baliwag, Bulacan; Sorsogon, Sorsogon; Carcar City; and Naga City. Used to decorate public buildings, schools, and plazas in the 1910s to the 1920s, the demand for busts of Rizal and other heroic figures, like <a href=\"/9/9/5250\">Marcelo del Pilar</a>, <a href=\"/9/80/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>, and Gregorio del Pilar, constituted a market that energized the sculptors of Santa Cruz and Quiapo, Manila, particularly the workshops of Ramon Martinez, Eulogio Garcia, and Vidal Tampinco, with assistants coming from the faculty and graduates of the UP Escuela de Bellas Artes. Among the latter were Ambrocio Morales, <a href=\"/3/3/3538\">Severino Fabie</a>, V. Barrientos, and Guillermo Tolentino. Similarly, when the new public structures in Manila, such as <a href=\"/2/11/2633\">Juan Arellano</a>&#x2019;s Jones Bridge (1917, destroyed 1945) and the <a href=\"/2/8/320\">Legislative Building</a> (1925, destroyed 1945), or the new UP Campus along Padre Faura were being finished from 1925 to 1935, their sculptural facade and pedestal designs required sculptors versed in using reinforced concrete. Ramon Martinez sculpted the allegorical figures titled <b><i>La Madre Filipina</i></b> (Filipino Mother) on the monumental socles of the Jones Bridge. These are currently found at the Rizal Park and the Manila Court of Appeals Building. Vidal Tampinco designed the sculptural program at the Legislative Building, particularly the allegorical figures at the central pediment. On the other hand, Vicente Francisco undertook the sculptural program of UP Padre Faura&#x2019;s Quadrangle from 1925 to 1930, with pedestaled works titled <b><i>Education and Youth</i></b>,<b><i> Agriculture</i></b>,<i> </i>and <b><i>Law</i></b>. In 1935, Guillermo Tolentino would decorate the podium of UP Padre Faura&#x2019;s Villamor Hall with the statues titled <b><i>Painting</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Music</i></b> (Lico 2008, 282-87).<i> </i>All this public ornamentation was undertaken using the Beaux Arts style. In 1927-29, the Italian migrant sculptor <a href=\"/3/17/3670\">Francesco Monti</a> undertook the sculptural program at the <a href=\"/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> using an Art Deco style, as demonstrated in the famed veiled dancers on its cornice, and <b><i>Adam</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Eve</i> </b>at the main staircase. Monti also designed the sculptural facade of the old Meralco Building along San Marcelino St (demolished 2014), and the series of saints at the cornice of the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Main Building. In 1931, the <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2150\"><strong>Bonifacio Monument</strong></a></strong> </i></b> by Tolentino was unveiled at Grace Park, Caloocan. It had a sculptural tableau that featured the events from 1872, such as the execution of Fathers Jose Burgos, Jacinto Zamora, and Mariano Gomez or the GomBurZa, to the 1896 Katipunan Revolution, with Bonifacio at its head flanked by <a href=\"/9/80/5393\">Emilio Jacinto</a> and other revolutionaries. Tolentino&#x2019;s sculptural focus on revolutionary sacrifice and martyrdom would be complemented with the unveiling on 30 Nov 1935 of the reinforced concrete statue titled<b> <i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2240\"><strong>Oblation</strong></a></strong> </i></b> at the UP Padre Faura Quadrangle."

In particular, Alvero was famed as a master of the <b>bodegon</b>, or still life painting. His bodegon paintings on the walls of the 1911 renovated house of Gen Antonio Bautista in Malolos are some of the few remaining works attributed to him. Outside Manila, the church interior muralists based in Cebu, such as Raymundo Francia and Canuto Avila, once more decorated church ceilings throughout Cebu and Bohol from 1920 to 1941. In Angono, the devotional paintings of Juan Senson, and santo<i> </i>statuary by Pedro Pi&#xF1;on continued to be generated for local consumption from the 1900s to the mid-1920s; while next-generation Angono natives, like the UP-educated Moises Villaluz, worked in the Laguna Lake area of Los Ba&#xF1;os. In 1929, Fernando Amorsolo was commissioned to paint two murals for the <a href=\"/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a>, <b><i>Music </i></b>and <b><i>Dance</i></b>. The results bore a combination of his academic style of dramatic chiaroscuro contrasts, as well as an increasing focus on traditional ethnographic motifs and precolonial imagery.<i> </i>In the early 1930s, the designs of American muralist Eugene Francis Savage became a major influence in the works of emerging painters like Enrique J.

Ruiz decorated several theaters in Manila and the <a href=\"/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> using the Savage style and displayed two panels of the same style at the 1934 Manila Carnival (Casta&#xF1;eda 1964; Roces 1975; Savellon and Abaquita 2004; Saguinsin 2006)."

Juan Abelardo also did landscapes in addition to interiors, mostly around San Miguel de Mayumo and Sibul (Casta&#xF1;eda 1964, 79-84). From the mid-1920s to the 1930s, Miguel Zaragoza, Patricio Gaston O&#x2019;Farrell, and Jorge Pineda would return to landscape painting as a means of self-fulfillment, using an academic style akin to the plein air painting of the Barbizon School. In addition, seascapes became an increasing area of concern, as the early works of <a href=\"/3/17/3466\">Alfredo Carmelo</a> from 1935 onward would prove. As early as 1916, post-Impressionist landscapes of the Marikina River area were already being painted by Juan Arellano. However, this early modernist rendering of Philippine landscape would not expand until the arrival from studies abroad by Victorio Edades in 1928 and <a href=\"/3/17/3631\">Diosdado Lorenzo</a> in 1935."

Among Fabian de la Rosa&#x2019;s portraits of prominent politicians were those of Gen Leonard Wood, 1910; Woodrow Wilson, 1913; William Atkinson Jones, undated; and Manuel and Aurora Aragon Quezon, 1927. Among the next generation after de la Rosa, it was the dominant influence of Fernando Amorsolo in painting that could be seen in portraiture from the mid-1910s to the mid-1930s. Among Amorsolo&#x2019;s early portraits is that of <a href=\"/3/82/2181\">Fernanda de Jesus</a>, 1915, in which the ideal of the rural lass, carrying a bamboo tray full of flowers, signals a transformation of the austerely formal academic realist depiction to a softer, more organic rendering of nature, humanity, and sunlight. The academic tradition of darkened backgrounds, light streaming upon the sitter as if suddenly illuminated by a camera flash, could still be seen in Amorsolo portraits like <b><i>Portrait of a Katipunero</i></b>,<i> </i>1917, and <b><i>Portrait of Mrs. Sonia Rifkin</i></b>,<i> </i>1930.

Fabian de la Rosa and Jorge Pineda started this trend with their scenes of farmers planting rice, local craftspeople like lantern makers and hat makers working at their trade, and the playing of local games. By the early 1920s, this would be expanded via the work of Amorsolo, who returned from his pensionado grant to Spain and the United States. Amorsolo&#x2019;s 1921 and 1924 versions of <b><i>Planting Rice</i> </b>and the 1922 and 1925 versions of <b><i><strong><strong>Harvest</strong></strong> Time in <strong><strong>Pinaglabanan</strong></strong> </i></b><i> </i>demonstrated a shift from de la Rosa&#x2019;s use of subtle lighting and demure figuration set in the far countryside to that which privileged an increasing emphasis on physical virility, sensuality, and the dramatic illumination of tropical sunlight set in the suburbs of Manila. The multiple versions of these themes, where subtle variations of composition and lighting set them apart from one another, were harbingers of the enormous and consistent output of Amorsolo as a rural genre painter. His economic and stylistic dominance were assured via his popularity among foreign collectors in international exhibitions, such as the one mounted in Art Center Gallery in New York City, 1925; the Grand Central Art Gallery, also in New York City, 1929; and the Paris Exposition Coloniale Internationale, 1931. By the early 1930s, the dominance of Amorsolo&#x2019;s genre paintings created two approaches among the practice of his so-called conservative followers. One was characterized by the disavowal of the formula of brightly lit rural genre scenes, and instead focusing on an earlier style associated with Fabian de la Rosa; while the second imitated Amorsolo to satisfy the large public demand for this kind of rural genre painting. Among proponents of the first would count Fernando&#x2019;s younger brother Pablo Amorsolo, who would decorate the Ocampo mansion in Quiapo with historical murals characterized by an illustrational hard-edged line similarly used by pre-Raphaelite artists. Among proponents of the second approach were <a href=\"/3/3/3712\">Jose Pereira</a>, Irineo Miranda, Severino Fabie, <a href=\"/3/3/3559\">Antonio Llamas Garcia</a>, and <a href=\"/3/3/3467\">Dominador Casta&#xF1;eda</a>, whose paintings all bore similarities to Amorsolo&#x2019;s subjects and themes. The works of these artists, alongside of their mentors like Vicente Rivera, Toribio Herrera, and Jorge Pineda, would constitute the mass market of idyllic genre paintings of contented farmers, peaceful pictures of the countryside, and generic scenes of farming and fishing communities that would be labeled &#x201C;conservative&#x201D; in the years to come (Casta&#xF1;eda 1964; Roces 1975; Pilar 1992)."

Besides Pineda aka Makahiya, other famous illustrators of the period 1908-35 would include Jose Pereira for <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> and Fernando Amorsolo for <b><i>The Independent</i></b>. The nature of their illustration work was informed by their academic training: those of Makahiya appeared as graphic versions of accomplished paintings where commentaries were telegraphed at the bottom; those of Amorsolo were crisp, concise characterizations of major figures who were prominently featured, often devoid of background detailing, and featured small balloon-encased texts; while Pereira maximized the space of the illustration with deeply crosshatched chiaroscuro contrasts, the main figures dominating the space, and bold-faced texts wrapped in cubistic balloons. Starting from the mid-1930s, they would be joined by <a href=\"/3/3/3593\">Esmeraldo Izon</a> and <a href=\"/3/17/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a>. Besides weeklies, special print illustrations also beckoned. The most famous is Guillermo Tolentino&#x2019;s <b><i>Filipinos Ilustres</i></b> (Illustrious Filipinos), 1911, a fictive group portrait of the heroes and martyrs of the Katipunan revolution. This was translated into a lithograph by Pineda and printed by Carmelo and Bauermann. Commercial design for corporate products was also a prominent area of visual art that bloomed in this period. Fernando Amorsolo was a dominant practitioner from 1916 to 1925 by virtue of his art directorship of the <a href=\"/2/8/349\">Pacific Commercial Company</a>, and responsible for designing various ads, such as the famous Ginebra San Miguel label <b><i>Markang Demonyo</i></b><i> </i>(Mark of the Demon), 1917, and that of Ivory soap.

Conversely, he was supported by pro-modernist writers like the artist Gregorio Paredes (Reyes 1989). In particular, <b><i>The Builders</i></b><i> </i>elicited negative comments because of its brutalist and distorted depiction of human laborers in a stone quarry or construction site. The emphasis on formal composition, with the mural&#x2019;s distribution of human laborers and stones set as interlocking pieces of shapes and hues of light and dark like a cubic, thickly painted jigsaw puzzle ignoring singular perspective and naturalistic anatomy, alienated a public accustomed to the academic fantasy of rural genres that successive generations of artists from Fabian de la Rosa to Fernando Amorsolo popularized.<i> </i>In 1934, Edades formed a group called the Triumvirate, composed of himself, <a href=\"/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a>, and <a href=\"/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>, to execute mural commissions using an Art Deco/modernist style for projects by <a href=\"/2/2/2681\">Juan Nakpil</a>. This included <b><i>Rising Philippines</i></b>, 1934 (destroyed 1945), which decorated the lobby of the Capitol Theater in Escolta. This was a pioneering Philippine Modern mural design that utilized multiple perspectives and a flat tapestry-like design inspired from both American Regionalist as well as Mexican Social Realist murals. Dominated by a figure of a woman in white representing the Philippines, ascending vertically from the lower left to upper right of the canvas, <b><i>Rising Philippines</i></b> legitimized the claims of artistic ascendancy among Edades&#x2019;s circle, which was confirmed via the commissioned paintings of elite clients like the Rufino family and Pres Manuel L. Quezon, whose mansion on Roberts St, Pasay, was decorated by the Triumvirate. Another collaborative work is <b><i>Mother Nature&#x2019;s Bounty</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1935, which shows the developing concern of artists for planar composition dominated by curvilinear lines and organic planes. Of the three, it would be Carlos Francisco, called Botong, who would develop the visuality of Philippine Modern Art through muralism and a renewed focus on historical episodes, as well as rural genre. The latter is poignantly demonstrated in his undated <b><i>Angelus</i></b>. Two events in 1935 also strengthened the modernists&#x2019; hand in their developing discursive drive to supplant the conservatives: first, the opening of the <a href=\"/3/3/3810\">UST School of Fine Arts</a> at Sampaloc, with Edades as its director, and Ocampo and Francisco among its pioneering faculty; and second, the arrival of Diosdado Lorenzo from his studies in Italy. Lorenzo brought with him a thickly impastoed palette inspired by encounters with the Italian Macchiaioli School. Lorenzo&#x2019;s 1935 solo exhibit at the Philippine Columbian Club was, by contrast, well received for his depiction of rural scenes and portraits using this technique (Kalaw-Ledesma and Guerrero 1981; Ty-Navarro 1985; Guillermo 1986, 2009; Reyes 1989; Flores 2010)."

				"value": "With the proclamation of the Philippine Commonwealth Republic on 15 Nov 1935 under Pres Manuel L. Quezon and Vice Pres Sergio Osme&#xF1;a Sr, the 10-year countdown toward full Philippine independence began. Although governance, jurisprudence, and legislation were now exclusively held by Filipinos, foreign policy and national defense were still American spheres of concern, subject to final decisions from Washington. The outlines of a cacique<i> </i>democracy had already been fleshed out in the previous two decades since the Philippine Assembly period, but its negative effects on the countryside began to be felt as landlords began to impose exorbitant harvest quotas on planters as peasants and landless farmers agitated for genuine land reform (Kerkvliet 1979). Agricultural revolts, such as the May 1935 Sakdalista Revolt, had already agitated the countryside. Nonetheless, the special relations quota of cash crops and the gold exports to the USA had financially kept the upper middle class afloat to an extent that this blinded them to increasing class inequalities. Tensions over Japan&#x2019;s increasingly assertive military expansionism also required the mobilization of Filipinos under Gen Douglas MacArthur to form the bulk of the US Army Forces in the Far East in 1941. Comforted by a false sense of security provided by the Americans, the Filipino elite and upper middle class consumed vast amounts of imported goods, and were also increasingly open to modern ideas on art&#x2014;or at least those legitimated in the USA, like Regionalism and Mexican Social Realism. The Jazz Moderne phase of Art Deco, with its streamlined &#x201C;steamship&#x201D; aesthetics, became a popular style that was translated into <a href=\"/3/15/2102\">furniture</a> design (notably, Juan Nakpil&#x2019;s <b><i>Ambassador Chair</i></b> for Puyat &amp; Sons), fashion, and industrial design. Despite this mania for international trends, the nativist national cultural movement gained full steam with the dominance of Jorge Bocobo as UP president (1935-39) and later education secretary (1939-41). This was particularly made manifest in the pioneering documentation of Philippine traditional and folk art by UP-based scholars like <a href=\"/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes</a> (later Mrs Aquino), as well as the decision to categorically make Filipino the national language heavily drawing from Tagalog as linguistic base. This was a move affirmed by Quezon in 1937."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "It was the combination of Modernism with nativism that saw the development of a hybrid genre subject, the modernist depiction of native women. Victorio Edades&#x2019;s <b><i>Bulul at Babae</i></b><i> </i>(Bulul and Woman), undated, and Galo B. Ocampo&#x2019;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2154\"><strong>Brown Madonna</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1938, are typical of this movement. Both espouse post-Impressionist and Expressionist techniques such as the use of blocklike brown-skinned figures as seen in the works of Paul Gauguin, alongside the employment of a series of curvilinear patterns that flatten into tapestry-like designs. Even in scenic painting, the modernist influence could be seen in the work of <a href=\"/3/3/3522\">Vicente Alvarez Dizon</a>. In <b><i>After the Day&#x2019;s Toil</i></b>, 1938, he used smooth curvilinear lines and flattened planes. This was Dizon&#x2019;s Yale University master&#x2019;s thesis under Eugene Savage. This work won first prize at the 1939 Golden Gate International Exposition at San Francisco. Francisco&#x2019;s two murals for the UST Main Building, jointly titled <b><i>Introduction of Christianity in the Philippines</i></b>,<i> </i>1939-40, favors an even flatter use of planar surface. While thematic emphasis is placed on the human figures, they are interrelated with background elements via the introduction of a flowing series of curved lines, a visual feature that would become prominent in Botong&#x2019;s works in the years to come. The increasing debates between conservatives and moderns also began in the period between 1934 and 1939 in various weekly journals and newsletters. This was a consequence of the initial debates following Edades&#x2019;s 1928 solo exhibition at the Philippine Columbian Club, where his Expressionist paintings were derided by critics like Ariston Estrada for being &#x201C;ugly&#x201D; and &#x201C;not fit to be seen by children and women in the family way.&#x201D; Edades fought back with articles asserting that Modernism was a natural progression from Classical Art of the Greeks and Romans, while Conservatism was simply content to repeat the academic formulas of the 19th century. Edades would be joined by Galo B. Ocampo in 1935 and would receive support from such writers as <a href=\"/9/9/5462\">Salvador P. Lopez</a> (who defended the peasantry depictions of Galo Ocampo, Edades, and Carlos Francisco in a pioneering article about proletarian art in the Philippines) and the Veronicans, which included <a href=\"/9/80/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a> and <a href=\"/3/3/3686\">Hernando Ruiz Ocampo</a>, the latter inspired by the Triumvirate to paint his own proletarian period paintings. This circle of avant-garde writers that met at the Ivory Tower caf&#xE9; on Herran St would foster an intelligentsia that was sympathetic to Modernism in the years to come (Casta&#xF1;eda 1964; Ty-Navarro 1985; Pilar 1992; Amorsolo and Pilar<i> </i>2008)."

It would also be at this time that the followers of Amorsolo, such as Ramon Peralta, Irineo Miranda, and Dominador Casta&#xF1;eda, would expand upon the visual language of genre works through their specialization on specific subject matter: for Miranda, persons in contemporary dress and situations; for Casta&#xF1;eda and Peralta, rural landscape. Starting in the early 1940s, they would be joined by <a href=\"/3/3/3768\">Simon Saulog</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3555\">Miguel Galvez</a>, Elias Laxa, and <a href=\"/3/17/3630\">Crispin Lopez</a>, whose works catered to both elite collectors like Jorge Vargas and <a href=\"/9/9/5036\">Aurelio Alvero</a>, as well as foreign tourists thronging Manila at the eve of war. These artists would form the nucleus of the conservative painters who would confront the modernists in the postwar period. At the time, their studios and shops were still distributed in a loose constellation starting from Quiapo, Santa Cruz, San Nicolas, and Intramuros all the way to Tondo."

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">When war broke out in Asia and the Pacific on 8 Dec 1941, the Philippines, like other nations affected by this major world conflict, had to deal with drastic changes in its social, political, and economic life. Japan occupied the Philippines primarily due to the latter&rsquo;s status as an American colony and its strategic position in Southeast Asia (Jose 1992, 11). Upon occupying the Philippines, one of the preliminary steps taken by the Japanese was to lay the groundwork for a &ldquo;cultural regeneration&rdquo; centered on the development of the &ldquo;consciousness of the people as Orientals&rdquo; (<i>Tribune</i> 1942, 1, 8). This was in line with Japan&rsquo;s goal to lead all Asian nations in what was to be called the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This cultural regeneration called for the relinquishing of Western influences and the rejuvenation of local and indigenous traditions. Among the fields identified by the Japanese as vital in the implementation of its policies and propaganda were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, art objects, stage plays, movies, song, and music (Terami-Wada 1992, 23).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In line with Japan&rsquo;s recognition of art&rsquo;s vital role in its campaign, a number of Filipino artists were invited to a luncheon at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> on 10 Aug 1942. The luncheon was tagged by the <b><i>Tribune </i></b>as a &ldquo;fraternal get-together&rdquo; with Japanese artists (<i>Sunday Tribune</i> 1942, 1). The title of the newspaper article, &ldquo;Because Artists Are Builders Too,&rdquo; unabashedly pronounced the important role of art in the &ldquo;reconstruction of the New Philippines.&rdquo; Invited to the luncheon were well-known Filipino artists who were known conservative leaders, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> and his brother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3397\">Pablo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3665\">Irineo Miranda</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3467\">Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3739\">Vicente Rivera y Mir</a>, and modernist leaders <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3686\">Hernando R. Ocampo</a>. The Japanese contingent was represented by a motley group of artists working in different styles. At this dinner, both Filipino and Japanese artists sketched each other&rsquo;s portraits on a long vertical scroll of paper as a symbol of unity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A number of paintings done during this period depicted themes that conformed to the programs set out by the Japanese. <b><i>Reconstruction and Rehabilitation</i></b>, 1943, by Gregorio Sibug shows workers setting up the foundation of a new house encouraging Filipinos to rise above the ashes of war and to start anew. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3522\">Vicente Alvarez Dizon</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>A Day Begins</i></b>, 1942, depicts a bright future in a rural scene basking in the glow of the rising sun with rays of light radiating around the sun explicitly referring to the Japanese imperial flag. A number of works also highlighted Filipino tradition in line with the Japanese policy of relinquishing Western mores. These works depicted Filipino customs and virtues such as industry, family solidarity, respect for tradition, and religiosity (Pilar 1992, 151). Examples are Fernando Amorsolo&rsquo;s <b><i>Laundry </i><em>Women</em></b>,<b> </b>1943, and his harvest and fishing scenes; Marcelino Rivera&rsquo;s <b><i>The Fisherman</i></b>, 1944; Emilio Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>Christmas Eve</i></b>, 1942; and Cirilo Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>Going to the <strong>Misa</strong> de Gallo</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1942. The focus on indigenous themes was also seen in works depicting native facial features and costumes such as <b><i>Study of an Aeta</i></b>, 1944, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3630\">Crispin Lopez</a> and <b><i>Moro Datu</i></b>, 1942, by Felix Zablan. To further instill this ideology and to emphasize the need for reconstruction, three paintings were chosen by the Japanese for the cover of <b><i>Shin Seiki</i></b> magazine in 1943. These were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3735\">Francisco Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Forging Ahead </i></b>(title by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3719\">Santiago Pilar</a>), 1943, <b><i>Young Lady with a Japanese Primer</i></b>, 1943, by Fernando Amorsolo, and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2154\"><strong>Brown Madonna</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1938, by Galo B. Ocampo (Pilar 1992, 152). Other works during this period did not explicitly refer to the new order but were merely anecdotal, capturing scenes of everyday life during the occupation with seeming apathy. Crispin Lopez&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2134\"><strong>Baguio Market</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1943, depicted a state of normalcy while Marcelino Sanchez&rsquo;s <b><i>Tales of Bataan</i></b>, 1944, portrays a storyteller recounting his ordeal to an eager crowd treated to a narrative sans emotional content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Using art as an important conduit to reach the Filipino people, the Japanese hired well-known prewar illustrators like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3568\">Liborio &ldquo;Gat&rdquo; Gatbonton</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a> to illustrate for the Japanese-sponsored papers. The 1 Oct 1941 issue of the <b><i>Shin Seiki</i></b> magazine featured a cartoon by Gatbonton titled <b><i>Establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</i></b> showing people belonging to different nations under Japanese rule working together to build a tower. In contrast to Gatbonton&rsquo;s usual polemical and inflammatory depiction of characters, the Japanese are portrayed in this cartoon as friends and not foes. Tony Velasquez and Gatbonton also illustrated for the Japanese-sponsored <b><i>Tribune</i></b>. Velasquez&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2213\"><strong>The Kalibapi Family</strong></a></strong> </i></b> promoted Japanese slogans and served to educate Filipinos on the new policies implemented by the Japanese. For instance, <b><i>The Kalibapi Family </i></b>would remind readers of the wisdom of traditional Filipino virtues and of substituting imported products with local ones (Cheng Chue 2005, 81-82).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino artists also assumed key positions in Japanese-created organizations. Victorio Edades served as chief artist of the Kapisanan sa Paglilingkod sa Bagong Pilipinas (Kalibapi), an organization created by the Japanese on 4 Dec 1942 whose main task was &ldquo;to bring about the reconstruction and unification of the new Philippines&rdquo; and presumably had overall control of the cultural policy in the Philippines (Jose 1992, 13). As chief artist, his job was to paint portraits, posters, signs, and placards for conventions and stage backdrops (Pilar 1992, 150). Edades also organized art exhibitions and competitions during his stint as chief artist. In 1943, Edades took a leave from the Kalibapi to research on the biographies of artists in the Vargas collection, which would be published later in a catalogue titled <b><i>Paintings by Filipino Artists in the Art Collection of Jorge B. Vargas </i></b>(Pilar 1992, 150). In 1944, Edades was transferred to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a> and appointed as interior decorator and artist of the Board of Information of the Philippine Republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While it may seem that many Filipino artists were acquiescent, one must remember that the peculiar conditions of war and heavy censorship left them with little choice but to toe the line in order to survive. Santiago Pilar argued that the points which the Japanese asserted in their campaign found expression only in the subject matter of art (Pilar 1992, 151). Similarly, Ricardo Jose contends that many artists took the lines propagated by the Japanese &ldquo;half-heartedly &hellip; many waiting for better times, fence sitting&rdquo; (1992, 15).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Writing on the state of art during the Japanese occupation, Galo B. Ocampo observed that &ldquo;the chaotic political situation and the economic instability produced an environment that could not possibly nurture cultural development&rdquo; and that &ldquo;art was relegated to the theatre, artists to backdrop painters &hellip; The aesthetic turned utilitarian&rdquo; (Guillermo 2009, 65). This statement confirms the fact that as the exigencies of war reshaped institutions and imposed restrictions on art, Filipino artists continued to produce art under conditions of duress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Fernando Amorsolo was among the most productive of the Filipino artists. In order to survive, he accepted several painting commissions. He produced several works for Jorge B. Vargas, among which are <b><i><strong><strong>Harvest</strong></strong> Scene</i></b> and <b><i>Fishing Scene</i></b>, 1942. He also did self-portraits, portraits of patrons, rural and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">market</a> scenes, still life, and sketches of Japanese soldiers (Foronda 1975, 27). Amorsolo also recorded for posterity historic events during the war, such as <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2149\"><strong>Bombing of the Intendencia</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1942; <b><i>Rizal Avenue on Fire</i></b>, 1945; <b><i>Ruins of the <strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></i></b>, 1945; and <b><i><strong>San Sebastian Church</strong> through Quiapo Ruins</i></b>, 1945. These works are significant given the restrictions imposed on photographs during this period (Jose 1992, 15). Other lesser known artists, such as Siauinco de Guzman, remained active during this period and continued to carve religious figures (Foronda 1975, 27).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Filipino patrons and connoisseurs continued to support the arts during this period. Art connoisseur Jorge B. Vargas commissioned several paintings from his friend Amorsolo. Vargas is said to have collected around 89 works dated 1942-45 during the war years (Pilar 1992, 149). Another art collector was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5036\">Aurelio Alvero</a> who was chief of the cultural division of the Kalibapi. Alvero acquired a substantial number of artworks during the Japanese occupation. His collection reached 163 pieces representing 36 artists (Pilar 1992, 149). He opened his collection to the public on 4-8 Nov 1942, and there he also launched an annotated brochure of Filipino artists titled <b><i>Art in Tagala</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>Among the painters represented in the Alvero collection were Fernando and Pablo Amorsolo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3733\">Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</a>, Vicente Rivera Y Mir, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3528\">Antonio Dumlao</a>, Galo B. Ocampo, Hernando R. Ocampo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\">Ricarte Puruganan</a> (Foronda 1975, 28-29). Alvero exhibited prewar paintings as well as works done during the war, like a painting by Fernando Amorsolo titled <b><i>Bansag Dahuyong sa Bukid</i></b> (Air Raid Alarms in the Field), 1942, <b><i>Ang Kasal</i></b> (The Wedding), 1942, and Puruganan&rsquo;s <b><i>Wedding Picture</i></b>, 1942 (Foronda 1975, 29). Another private art collector was Dr Jose Bantug who, according to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5303\">Marcelino Foronda</a>, had one of the most distinguished private collections in the country. Although it was not open to the public, it was said to have been accessible to art historians and critics (Foronda 1975, 29). The Bantug collection consisted of bas reliefs in wood, which were religious in subject matter and mostly finished in polychrome. These wooden bas reliefs were said to have come from different areas in the Philippines such as Pasig, Bataan, Iloilo, Camarines Sur, Laguna, Tarlac, Rizal, and Bulacan. Aside from private galleries and collections, the Gallery of Arts and History of the National Library was open during the Japanese occupation. The gallery held 150 paintings, 80 historical objects, several <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a>, and 1,500 museum objects (Foronda 1975, 30).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Art critics were also active during this period. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5481\">I.V. Mallari</a> wrote on the need for a new building to house the national museum (Pilar 1992, 150). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3488\">Emilio Aguilar Cruz</a> published &ldquo;The Autochthonous Tradition,&rdquo; which was a stinging critique of the need for self-expression beyond the veneer of academism. Pointedly criticizing both conservatives and modernists, Cruz stated that while young Filipino painters during the occupation had seemingly rid themselves of conservative clich&eacute;s, &ldquo;many had tended to lapse into banalities of modernism to produce new and bigger clich&eacute;s and the result had been a tendency toward academism of a different mark, but academism nevertheless&rdquo; (Foronda 1975, 31).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two major art exhibitions were held during the occupation, one in 1943 and another in 1944, both organized by Edades. A literary and art contest was also held during the foundation day celebration of Manila in 1943 (Pilar 1992, 150). While the Japanese intended these art exhibitions to promote the new order, they unwittingly became fora for the continuing debate between the modernists and the conservatives that first exploded in the prewar era. In the 29 Dec 1943 national art exhibition/competition, Amorsolo&rsquo;s <b><i>Cockfight Scene</i></b> and Puruganan&rsquo;s <b><i>Bullfight</i></b> won first and second prizes, respectively. The themes clearly promoted local values as espoused by the new Japanese government, but the event also reflected the continuing dominance of the conservatives who bagged the major prizes. A second art exhibition/competition was held on 19 Jun 1944, toward the end of the occupation. Edades chaired the board of judges with members <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5388\">Francisco B. Icasiano</a> and Kazu Wakita. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a> took home most of the awards. Francisco&rsquo;s <b><i>Angelus</i></b> won first<sup> </sup>prize, his <b><i>Angono Fiesta</i></b> bagged the second prize, and <b><i>Frugal Meal in the Farm</i></b> first honorable mention (<b><i>Tribune</i></b> 1944, 1). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a> won third place for <b><i>Siesta in Harvest Time</i></b>. Other winners were Galo B. Ocampo for <b><i>First Harvest</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3487\">Bonifacio Cristobal</a> for <b><i>Prayer</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3565\">Wenceslao Garcia</a> for <b><i>Communal Cooperation</i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3807\">Virginia Ty</a> for <b><i>Feeding the Chicks</i></b>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a> for <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b>. Only Wenceslao Garcia&rsquo;s work was in the conservative style. The prizes were bagged mostly by the modernists. This caused a stir among conservatives who felt that Edades used his position as chief of the Kalibapi and head of the board of judges to manipulate the results of the competition. The public joined this debate, sending letters to the editors of the <b><i>Tribune</i></b>, some siding with the conservatives and others with the modernists (<i>Tribune</i> 1944).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since survival was the main concern during the occupation, artists eked out a living by dabbling in commercial arts. Carlos V. Francisco (Botong) worked for film director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>&rsquo;s advertising outfit, <b><i>Kiko Art</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>doing billboards and other commercial arts. Aside from billboards, Botong designed and executed sets and posters for stage plays that Conde directed and produced. He also sewed dolls and designed their costumes, which he and Conde sold at the Life Theater (Tiongson 2008, 34). Other Filipino artists who were not working in the mainstream also continued to use their talent in order to survive. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3745\">Manuel Rodriguez Sr</a> opened an art school in Naga and taught drawing and painting outdoors under a nipa shelter. He was paid with whatever the people had such as rice, chicken, and vegetables (Harding 1974, 21). It is interesting to note that art continued to thrive in the peripheral areas and that people were willing to pay for art lessons. Perhaps art acted as a necessary catharsis, helping people forget the harshness of war. When Rodriguez returned to Manila, he harnessed his artistic talents to design and make coconut brooches. This business later expanded to include elaborate hand-painted wooden fans and wooden sandals or <b>bakya</b>. He recounted that the bakya had become very popular due to the shortage of raw <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials </a>such as leather and rubber for shoes and slippers. He also stated that selling bakya and native crafts was lucrative since they appealed to the Japanese soldiers and to those who had money (Harding 1974, 25). The designs he made for the bakya were &ldquo;native scenes of nipa hut, or stacks of rice, or coconut trees intricately carved around the heels&rdquo; (Harding 1974, 25). According to Rodriguez, the stacks of rice &ldquo;probably related to the people&rsquo;s wish for more rice during this time when supplies were low and substitutes were found for almost anything&rdquo; (Harding 1974, 25). Rodriguez also noted that the &ldquo;first experiment in cottage industries&rdquo; started during the occupation (Harding 1974, 26). A small group of artisans was housed in the Normal School and the group was composed of Filipino prisoners of war who were artistic. Accordingly, the Japanese, trying to win the sympathy of the people, allowed some of the prisoners of war to work for them making handbags, slippers, fans, belts, and wooden sandals for which they earned a peso a day (Harding 1974, 26). Rodriguez later set up his own cottage industry and hired artist friends selling their crafts to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite the restrictions and difficulties experienced during the Japanese occupation, some artists found ways, whether overt or covert, to depict the real state of the country during the occupation or to resist Japanese rule. The somber tone of works&mdash;like Pilar M. Santiago&rsquo;s <b><i>Evacuees</i></b>, 1941; Irineo Miranda&rsquo;s <b><i>Home from Work</i></b>, 1944; and Santiago Caluya&rsquo;s <b><i>Planting in a Thunderstorm</i></b>, 1944&mdash;depicts the hardships experienced by many during the occupation. Galo B. Ocampo did underground work for the United States Army Forces in the Far East while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3593\">Esmeraldo EZ Izon</a> did the maps and illustrations for the underground paper <b><i>The Liberator</i></b>. The illustrations for the underground papers may have been bland and unmemorable given the extreme circumstances under which they were produced. Out of expediency and due to the lack of time and money, illustrations had to remain simple, clear, and concise. Nevertheless, they played a vital role in disseminating information and boosting the morale of the Filipinos. Negros&rsquo; <b><i><strong>Voice of Freedom</strong></i></b> and <b><i>Tingug San Kalwasan </i></b>(Voice of Liberty) had more appeal in that they were individually colored with color pencils.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Tony Velasquez and Liborio Gatbonton did illustrations for the Japanese-sponsored <b><i>Tribune</i></b>. While they may have produced works that seemed to conform to the prevailing policies, they subtly incorporated in their works messages of subversion. While Gat&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2268\"><strong>Philosopher of the Sidewalk</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1942, presented images of normalcy depicting the main character going to a radio station to perform, going to dances, beaches, courting ladies, and traveling, some of his strips subtly mocked the Japanese administration over food shortage and the consequent policy of substituting cat meat for scarcer options (Cheng Chue 2005, 82-86). Similarly, Velasquez&rsquo;s <b><i>The Kalibapi Family</i></b>, in certain instances, commented on the folly of substituting scarce items with local products (Cheng Chue 2005). Cloaking their comments in humor, they were able to deflect the ire of the Japanese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Japanese occupation of the Philippines ended in 1945 when the Japanese signed their unconditional surrender to American troops who overpowered them in the Battle of Manila. As Manila lay in ruins after the battle, Filipinos celebrated their liberation but also mourned the loss of many of their country&rsquo;s cultural patrimony. Important artworks were destroyed or obliterated, such as those in historic buildings in Intramuros, the holdings in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a>, and those in the private collection of Dr Bantug. The liberation, however, allowed artists to finally give free rein to their repressed emotions. Gatbonton came out with a comic strip called <b><i>Jappy Days</i></b>, making fun of the Japanese in the most acerbic and inflammatory tone. Examples of postwar works that depict the brutality of the Japanese and the sufferings of the Filipinos during the war are Demetrio Diego&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2159\"><strong>Capas</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1948; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3631\">Diosdado Lorenzo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Rape and Massacre in Ermita</i></b>, 1947; <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2131\"><strong>Atrocities in Paco</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1947; <b><i>Execution at the Cemetery</i></b>, 1947; and Dominador Casta&ntilde;eda&rsquo;s <b><i>Doomed Family</i></b>, 1945. The physical immediacy of these haunting images captures the abominations of war and locates them in the realm of the imaginable.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Related Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B.

The luncheon was tagged by the <b><i>Tribune </i></b>as a &#x201C;fraternal get-together&#x201D; with Japanese artists (<i>Sunday Tribune</i> 1942, 1). The title of the newspaper article, &#x201C;Because Artists Are Builders Too,&#x201D; unabashedly pronounced the important role of art in the &#x201C;reconstruction of the New Philippines.&#x201D; Invited to the luncheon were well-known Filipino artists who were known conservative leaders, such as <a href=\"/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> and his brother <a href=\"/3/3/3397\">Pablo</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3665\">Irineo Miranda</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3467\">Dominador Casta&#xF1;eda</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>, and <a href=\"/3/3/3739\">Vicente Rivera y Mir</a>, and modernist leaders <a href=\"/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a>, and <a href=\"/3/3/3686\">Hernando R. Ocampo</a>. The Japanese contingent was represented by a motley group of artists working in different styles. At this dinner, both Filipino and Japanese artists sketched each other&#x2019;s portraits on a long vertical scroll of paper as a symbol of unity."

A number of works also highlighted Filipino tradition in line with the Japanese policy of relinquishing Western mores. These works depicted Filipino customs and virtues such as industry, family solidarity, respect for tradition, and religiosity (Pilar 1992, 151). Examples are Fernando Amorsolo&#x2019;s <b><i>Laundry </i><em>Women</em></b>,<b> </b>1943, and his harvest and fishing scenes; Marcelino Rivera&#x2019;s <b><i>The Fisherman</i></b>, 1944; Emilio Santiago&#x2019;s <b><i>Christmas Eve</i></b>, 1942; and Cirilo Santiago&#x2019;s <b><i>Going to the <strong>Misa</strong> de Gallo</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1942. The focus on indigenous themes was also seen in works depicting native facial features and costumes such as <b><i>Study of an Aeta</i></b>, 1944, by <a href=\"/3/17/3630\">Crispin Lopez</a> and <b><i>Moro Datu</i></b>, 1942, by Felix Zablan. To further instill this ideology and to emphasize the need for reconstruction, three paintings were chosen by the Japanese for the cover of <b><i>Shin Seiki</i></b> magazine in 1943. These were <a href=\"/3/17/3735\">Francisco Reyes</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Forging Ahead </i></b>(title by <a href=\"/3/3/3719\">Santiago Pilar</a>), 1943, <b><i>Young Lady with a Japanese Primer</i></b>, 1943, by Fernando Amorsolo, and <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2154\"><strong>Brown Madonna</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1938, by Galo B. Ocampo (Pilar 1992, 152). Other works during this period did not explicitly refer to the new order but were merely anecdotal, capturing scenes of everyday life during the occupation with seeming apathy. Crispin Lopez&#x2019;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2134\"><strong>Baguio Market</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1943, depicted a state of normalcy while Marcelino Sanchez&#x2019;s <b><i>Tales of Bataan</i></b>, 1944, portrays a storyteller recounting his ordeal to an eager crowd treated to a narrative sans emotional content."

The 1 Oct 1941 issue of the <b><i>Shin Seiki</i></b> magazine featured a cartoon by Gatbonton titled <b><i>Establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere</i></b> showing people belonging to different nations under Japanese rule working together to build a tower. In contrast to Gatbonton&#x2019;s usual polemical and inflammatory depiction of characters, the Japanese are portrayed in this cartoon as friends and not foes. Tony Velasquez and Gatbonton also illustrated for the Japanese-sponsored <b><i>Tribune</i></b>. Velasquez&#x2019;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2213\"><strong>The Kalibapi Family</strong></a></strong> </i></b> promoted Japanese slogans and served to educate Filipinos on the new policies implemented by the Japanese.

As chief artist, his job was to paint portraits, posters, signs, and placards for conventions and stage backdrops (Pilar 1992, 150). Edades also organized art exhibitions and competitions during his stint as chief artist. In 1943, Edades took a leave from the Kalibapi to research on the biographies of artists in the Vargas collection, which would be published later in a catalogue titled <b><i>Paintings by Filipino Artists in the Art Collection of Jorge B. Vargas </i></b>(Pilar 1992, 150). In 1944, Edades was transferred to <a href=\"/2/8/330\">Malaca&#xF1;an</a> and appointed as interior decorator and artist of the Board of Information of the Philippine Republic."

Similarly, Ricardo Jose contends that many artists took the lines propagated by the Japanese &#x201C;half-heartedly &#x2026; many waiting for better times, fence sitting&#x201D; (1992, 15)."

He also did self-portraits, portraits of patrons, rural and <a href=\"/2/5/238\">market</a> scenes, still life, and sketches of Japanese soldiers (Foronda 1975, 27). Amorsolo also recorded for posterity historic events during the war, such as <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2149\"><strong>Bombing of the Intendencia</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1942; <b><i>Rizal Avenue on Fire</i></b>, 1945; <b><i>Ruins of the <strong>Manila Cathedral</strong></i></b>, 1945; and <b><i><strong>San Sebastian Church</strong> through Quiapo Ruins</i></b>, 1945. These works are significant given the restrictions imposed on photographs during this period (Jose 1992, 15).

Vargas is said to have collected around 89 works dated 1942-45 during the war years (Pilar 1992, 149). Another art collector was <a href=\"/9/9/5036\">Aurelio Alvero</a> who was chief of the cultural division of the Kalibapi. Alvero acquired a substantial number of artworks during the Japanese occupation. His collection reached 163 pieces representing 36 artists (Pilar 1992, 149). He opened his collection to the public on 4-8 Nov 1942, and there he also launched an annotated brochure of Filipino artists titled <b><i>Art in Tagala</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>Among the painters represented in the Alvero collection were Fernando and Pablo Amorsolo, <a href=\"/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3733\">Felix Resurreccion Hidalgo</a>, Vicente Rivera Y Mir, <a href=\"/3/3/3528\">Antonio Dumlao</a>, Galo B. Ocampo, Hernando R. Ocampo, and <a href=\"/3/17/3723\">Ricarte Puruganan</a> (Foronda 1975, 28-29). Alvero exhibited prewar paintings as well as works done during the war, like a painting by Fernando Amorsolo titled <b><i>Bansag Dahuyong sa Bukid</i></b> (Air Raid Alarms in the Field), 1942, <b><i>Ang Kasal</i></b> (The Wedding), 1942, and Puruganan&#x2019;s <b><i>Wedding Picture</i></b>, 1942 (Foronda 1975, 29). Another private art collector was Dr Jose Bantug who, according to <a href=\"/9/9/5303\">Marcelino Foronda</a>, had one of the most distinguished private collections in the country. Although it was not open to the public, it was said to have been accessible to art historians and critics (Foronda 1975, 29). The Bantug collection consisted of bas reliefs in wood, which were religious in subject matter and mostly finished in polychrome. These wooden bas reliefs were said to have come from different areas in the Philippines such as Pasig, Bataan, Iloilo, Camarines Sur, Laguna, Tarlac, Rizal, and Bulacan. Aside from private galleries and collections, the Gallery of Arts and History of the National Library was open during the Japanese occupation. The gallery held 150 paintings, 80 historical objects, several <a href=\"/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a>, and 1,500 museum objects (Foronda 1975, 30)."

Pointedly criticizing both conservatives and modernists, Cruz stated that while young Filipino painters during the occupation had seemingly rid themselves of conservative clich&#xE9;s, &#x201C;many had tended to lapse into banalities of modernism to produce new and bigger clich&#xE9;s and the result had been a tendency toward academism of a different mark, but academism nevertheless&#x201D; (Foronda 1975, 31)."

A literary and art contest was also held during the foundation day celebration of Manila in 1943 (Pilar 1992, 150). While the Japanese intended these art exhibitions to promote the new order, they unwittingly became fora for the continuing debate between the modernists and the conservatives that first exploded in the prewar era. In the 29 Dec 1943 national art exhibition/competition, Amorsolo&#x2019;s <b><i>Cockfight Scene</i></b> and Puruganan&#x2019;s <b><i>Bullfight</i></b> won first and second prizes, respectively. The themes clearly promoted local values as espoused by the new Japanese government, but the event also reflected the continuing dominance of the conservatives who bagged the major prizes. A second art exhibition/competition was held on 19 Jun 1944, toward the end of the occupation. Edades chaired the board of judges with members <a href=\"/9/80/5388\">Francisco B. Icasiano</a> and Kazu Wakita. <a href=\"/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a> took home most of the awards. Francisco&#x2019;s <b><i>Angelus</i></b> won first<sup> </sup>prize, his <b><i>Angono Fiesta</i></b> bagged the second prize, and <b><i>Frugal Meal in the Farm</i></b> first honorable mention (<b><i>Tribune</i></b> 1944, 1). <a href=\"/3/17/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a> won third place for <b><i>Siesta in Harvest Time</i></b>. Other winners were Galo B. Ocampo for <b><i>First Harvest</i></b>, <a href=\"/3/17/3487\">Bonifacio Cristobal</a> for <b><i>Prayer</i></b>, <a href=\"/3/17/3565\">Wenceslao Garcia</a> for <b><i>Communal Cooperation</i></b>, <a href=\"/3/3/3807\">Virginia Ty</a> for <b><i>Feeding the Chicks</i></b>, and <a href=\"/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a> for <b><i>Planting Rice</i></b>. Only Wenceslao Garcia&#x2019;s work was in the conservative style. The prizes were bagged mostly by the modernists. This caused a stir among conservatives who felt that Edades used his position as chief of the Kalibapi and head of the board of judges to manipulate the results of the competition. The public joined this debate, sending letters to the editors of the <b><i>Tribune</i></b>, some siding with the conservatives and others with the modernists (<i>Tribune</i> 1944)."

				"value": "Since survival was the main concern during the occupation, artists eked out a living by dabbling in commercial arts. Carlos V. Francisco (Botong) worked for film director <a href=\"/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>&#x2019;s advertising outfit, <b><i>Kiko Art</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>doing billboards and other commercial arts. Aside from billboards, Botong designed and executed sets and posters for stage plays that Conde directed and produced. He also sewed dolls and designed their costumes, which he and Conde sold at the Life Theater (Tiongson 2008, 34). Other Filipino artists who were not working in the mainstream also continued to use their talent in order to survive. <a href=\"/3/3/3745\">Manuel Rodriguez Sr</a> opened an art school in Naga and taught drawing and painting outdoors under a nipa shelter. He was paid with whatever the people had such as rice, chicken, and vegetables (Harding 1974, 21). It is interesting to note that art continued to thrive in the peripheral areas and that people were willing to pay for art lessons. Perhaps art acted as a necessary catharsis, helping people forget the harshness of war. When Rodriguez returned to Manila, he harnessed his artistic talents to design and make coconut brooches. This business later expanded to include elaborate hand-painted wooden fans and wooden sandals or <b>bakya</b>. He recounted that the bakya had become very popular due to the shortage of raw <a href=\"/3/16/2121\">materials </a>such as leather and rubber for shoes and slippers. He also stated that selling bakya and native crafts was lucrative since they appealed to the Japanese soldiers and to those who had money (Harding 1974, 25). The designs he made for the bakya were &#x201C;native scenes of nipa hut, or stacks of rice, or coconut trees intricately carved around the heels&#x201D; (Harding 1974, 25). According to Rodriguez, the stacks of rice &#x201C;probably related to the people&#x2019;s wish for more rice during this time when supplies were low and substitutes were found for almost anything&#x201D; (Harding 1974, 25). Rodriguez also noted that the &#x201C;first experiment in cottage industries&#x201D; started during the occupation (Harding 1974, 26). A small group of artisans was housed in the Normal School and the group was composed of Filipino prisoners of war who were artistic. Accordingly, the Japanese, trying to win the sympathy of the people, allowed some of the prisoners of war to work for them making handbags, slippers, fans, belts, and wooden sandals for which they earned a peso a day (Harding 1974, 26). Rodriguez later set up his own cottage industry and hired artist friends selling their crafts to the government."

The illustrations for the underground papers may have been bland and unmemorable given the extreme circumstances under which they were produced.

Nevertheless, they played a vital role in disseminating information and boosting the morale of the Filipinos.

Similarly, Velasquez&#x2019;s <b><i>The Kalibapi Family</i></b>, in certain instances, commented on the folly of substituting scarce items with local products (Cheng Chue 2005).

As Manila lay in ruins after the battle, Filipinos celebrated their liberation but also mourned the loss of many of their country&#x2019;s cultural patrimony. Important artworks were destroyed or obliterated, such as those in historic buildings in Intramuros, the holdings in the <a href=\"/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a>, and those in the private collection of Dr Bantug. The liberation, however, allowed artists to finally give free rein to their repressed emotions. Gatbonton came out with a comic strip called <b><i>Jappy Days</i></b>, making fun of the Japanese in the most acerbic and inflammatory tone. Examples of postwar works that depict the brutality of the Japanese and the sufferings of the Filipinos during the war are Demetrio Diego&#x2019;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2159\"><strong>Capas</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1948; <a href=\"/3/17/3631\">Diosdado Lorenzo</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Rape and Massacre in Ermita</i></b>, 1947; <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2131\"><strong>Atrocities in Paco</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1947; <b><i>Execution at the Cemetery</i></b>, 1947; and Dominador Casta&#xF1;eda&#x2019;s <b><i>Doomed Family</i></b>, 1945.

		"text": "<p class=\"Bylinetext\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The postwar era opened with the country reeling from the aftereffects of World War II. With the country in shambles, Filipinos trained their sights on how to rebuild their lives. True to the adage that &ldquo;modernity can have no respect even for its own past&rdquo; and that meaning &ldquo;must be defined from within the maelstrom of change&rdquo; (Harvey 1990, 11-12), the modernists sought to disassemble the past and create a new language of art that could rightly express the changing times. It is in this context that the modernists in the postwar era continued to reject the serenity posed by conservative idioms, preferring to explore a new reality characterized by unrest and the physicality of form. They did this by harnessing the techniques of distortion and abstraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The period opened up opportunities for Filipino artists to study abroad, which exposed them to new trends in the West. Many Filipino artists went to Spain, France, Italy, Canada, and the United States on travel and study grants. An important publication that fueled the popularity of modern art among Filipino artists was <b><i>Life </i></b>magazine, which was brought into the country after the war (Torres 1992, 117). <b><i>Life</i></b> magazine featured the works of Picasso, Braque, Chagall, Kandinsky, Mondrian, Buffet, and Dubuffet, and the New York abstract expressionists (Torres 1992, 117). Having been exposed to these trends, the modernists took Edades&rsquo;s prewar post-Impressionist style toward abstraction. Artists who were working in this style and direction were referred to as the Neo-Realists. Artists of this movement were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3686\">Hernando R. Ocampo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3696\">Victor Oteyza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3789\">Romeo Tabuena</a>. They were later joined by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3752\">Nena Saguil</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3640\">Anita Magsaysay-Ho</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3745\">Manuel Rodriguez Sr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3738\">Cenon Rivera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3677\">Jeremias Elizalde Navarro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\">Jose Joya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3380\">Lee Aguinaldo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3658\">David Cortez Medalla</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike modern <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a> that made its entrance in the 1930s, the challenge to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s conservative style came later in the 1950s in the person of his student <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a> (Guillermo 1992, 323). While Tolentino&rsquo;s style was classical and romantic, Abueva&rsquo;s works denied idealization, utilizing slight distortion and elongation as he trained his attention on plastic form. He transformed <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials</a> such as wood and stone into forms that were sensuous and playful. His <b><i>Allegorical Harpoon</i></b>, 1964, and <b><i>Alabaster City</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1971, reveal his foray into stylization and abstraction. Abueva&rsquo;s large body of work done in a wide spectrum of materials and diverse sculptural language demonstrate his consistent desire to challenge conventions while he explored the malleable qualities of the material at hand. This tenacity and his rearing of several generations of subsequent sculptors through his teaching at the University of the Philippines led to Abueva&rsquo;s being recognized as the youngest recipient of the National Artist Award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The shadow cast by the 1930s debate between art for art&rsquo;s sake (l&rsquo;art pour l&rsquo;art) and art in service of society lingered through the early postwar years. The most acerbic debates on this subject were fought out in literature in the early 1940s when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5462\">Salvador P. Lopez</a> penned his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1623\"><b><i>Literature and Society</i></b></a>, 1940, defending the purposive nature of art against <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5768\">Jose Garcia Villa</a>&rsquo;s espousal of modernist expression as self-referential. In the visual arts, art for art&rsquo;s sake became one of the impetus in the development of abstraction. Abstract art, in its insistence on freedom of self-expression and form rather than content, took the direction of art for art&rsquo;s sake where the purpose was to produce art for its own sake and not for any edifying, utilitarian, or moral lessons. The Neo-Realists regarded plastic reality rather than mimetic representation as more important and insisted that a work should be judged by how it holds up as design rather than as portrayal of reality in every detail (Torres 1992, 118).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early postwar years, artists like H.R. Ocampo, Cesar Legaspi, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3685\">Galo B. Ocampo</a> continued to harness the power of art&rsquo;s capacity to depict the deplorable conditions of postwar reality. H.R. Ocampo&rsquo;s early works were overtly social realist. He depicted poverty and decadence by distorting figures and using violent, jarring colors. Aside from his social realist works, H.R. Ocampo also produced surreal pieces, harnessing the subconscious in works like <b><i>Nude with Flower and Candle</i></b>,<b> </b>1948, his winning entry in the first <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines (AAP)</a> competition, and <b><i>Ancestors</i></b>, 1951. Ocampo eventually moved on to less expressionistic works, concentrating on form and its plasticity. His works from 1952 onward became devoid of subject matter. To underline this shift further, these pieces were merely assigned numbers and letters as titles (Torres 1992, 153).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Equally powerful were Cesar Legaspi&rsquo;s own social realist works that depicted ordinary people as victims of an oppressive society. The mood of his early works were described as pensive, grim, and devoid of humor (Torres 1992, 150-51). Legaspi worked on monochrome in this early phase, but most of his works thereafter were characterized by the expressionistic use of color and a wide variety of subject matter&mdash;from dancers to flower gardens and street scenes. In the 1960s, his works showed a decided shift from expressionism to more structural and plastic qualities as he experimented with rock and quarry forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Galo B. Ocampo appropriated religious elements in Philippine culture, such as scenes of flagellation, to weave a surrealist vision of human suffering and damnation. Avoiding radical distortion, the modernist tendencies in his works are evidenced by his subjective use of color (Torres 1992, 141). Still retaining the tension evoked in his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2183\">Flagellant</a> series, Galo Ocampo reworked spatial composition in the mid-1950s by adding a stained glass effect as decorative element to receding spaces within his pictures (Guillermo 1994, 379).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">H.R. Ocampo, Legaspi, and Galo Ocampo moved on to more formal compositions in the mid-1950s. While this trend may suggest that they had succumbed to the modernist&rsquo;s insistence on form over content, it has been argued that &ldquo;neo-realism embodied a deeper political meaning and that the shearing off of visual signs is symptomatic of a worldwide shift in the nature of signification brought about by the exhaustion of nationalist narratives&rdquo; (Beller 2004, 18). Jonathan Beller, in his article on H.R. Ocampo&rsquo;s works, argues that this type of visuality, which is not subservient to a signifier, offered a realm of freedom (Beller 2004, 32). Therefore, H.R. Ocampo&rsquo;s fluid interlocking shapes in <b><i>Politico Cancer</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1958, can be read not as inchoate forms but as live, pulsing, shifting forms that allow the eye &ldquo;to dance in a relatively free quest for new orders and meanings&rdquo; (Beller 1999, 488).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The postwar period was also witness to the founding of art institutions that helped advance the cause of the modernists. The Art Association of the Philippines was founded in 1948 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3604\">Purita Kalaw-Ledesma</a> while the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3716\">Philippine Art Gallery (PAG)</a> was founded in 1950 by a group of women writers headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3414\">Lydia Villanueva-Arguilla</a>. The AAP and PAG supported modern art through regular art exhibitions and competitions. Neo-Realists working closely with Arguilla came to be known as PAG artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the first AAP competition held in 1948, all six prizes were awarded to the modernists. First place went to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a> for his work <b><i>Kaingin</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1945, which depicted men and women readying the land for slash-and-burn farming. The grit and more structural approach to figuration in Botong&rsquo;s workstood as a paradigmatic counterpoint to Amorsolo&rsquo;s idiomatic pastoral scenes. By bagging the first place, Francisco&rsquo;s work served notice to the public that art was moving in a modernist direction. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2159\"><strong>Capas</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1948, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3631\">Diosdado Lorenzo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Japanese Inhumanities</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1947, secured the second and fifth places in this competition. Diego&rsquo;s work is a poignant rendition of the victims of the Death March in Bataan rendered in pale and somber colors. Lorenzo used vivid expressionistic colors, such as striking oranges and intense yellows, to dramatize wartime atrocities. Other winning works were Vicente Manansala&rsquo;s <b><i>Banaklaot</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1948, where fishermen bringing their boats ashore with the vessels are depicted in distorted forms; Cesar Legaspi&rsquo;s <b><i>Sick Child</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1948, which highlighted the non-objective use of color; and H.R. Ocampo&rsquo;s <b><i>Nude with Flower and Candle</i></b>, 1948, a surreal work replete with Freudian symbols that many found enigmatic and sick (Torres 1992, 20). To the consternation of the conservatives, the modernists again swept the major prizes in the next three competitions sponsored by the AAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Two exhibitions were put up in the early 1950s to further convince the public that modern art was not an aberration nor simply a trend (Torres 1992, 122). The AAP sponsored the first Neo-Realist exhibition in 1950 while PAG put up the first exhibition of non-objective art in 1953. The first effort to break through the international art scene was organized by PAG through an exhibition of paintings and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a> of 21 artists shown in 1953-54. This exhibition traveled to New York and Washington with the help of Philippine diplomatic agencies and was twice noted by <b><i>The New York Times </i></b>and listed in <b><i>The New Yorker</i></b> magazine (Torres 1992, 122).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the Neo-Realists, Manansala, Tabuena, and Magsaysay-Ho did not completely obliterate subject matter. In their works, images of Philippine urban and rural life are still discernible and often depicted in bright, festive colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Vicente Manansala worked in the cubist style that presented a new reality by fragmenting objects and rearranging them. He was a student of Fernand Leger whose works exemplified movement and the use of volume and color. Manansala developed his own type of transparent cubism characterized by shifting and overlapping diaphanous planes and forms that were faceted like glass. He stayed close to the figurative tradition, simplifying his figures but not totally deleting them. His themes, such as vendors, native fruits, vegetables, dried fish, and street scenes, were evocative of local urban culture. His <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2222\"><strong>Madonna of the Slums</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1950, depicted poverty in urban Philippine society. His colors were not dull but vibrant and sensuous. Even as he continued to experiment with more simplified forms, his works never lost their emotional impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Romeo Tabuena was a talented artist who worked in various styles from almost calligraphic figures and misty landscapes reminiscent of Chinese watercolor paintings to expressionistic works in oil (Guillermo 1994, 58). He was able to depict stock images of Philippine life, like nipa huts, peasants, and madonnas, represented in a muted, disarming manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Anita Magsaysay-Ho&rsquo;s works showed a conservative slant in her choice of subject matter consisting of women harvesting or selling fish in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/238\">market</a> in their traditional attire. Though conservative in subject matter, her style was modernist as seen in the distortion of her figures and concern for decorative elements. Bold and expressionistic brushstrokes and strong tonal contrasts used in her early works were later replaced by a more lyrical and graceful quality produced by the careful arrangement of figures, soft lines, and more consistent modeling (Guillermo 1994, 369).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The circle as it is transformed in various ways is the predominant figure in Nena Saguil&rsquo;s works. This is discernible in her early genre and representational works in the 1940s, which emphasized the rotundity of figures. In the late 1960s, circular holes and relief elements were her predominant design motifs painted on irregularly shaped canvas, while her landscapes in the 1970s were filled with &ldquo;circles that rise and float in a bubble and rose ether&rdquo; (Guillermo 1994, 397).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other Neo-Realists of the period explored different strains of cubism that veered further away from the figurative. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3445\">Constancio Bernardo</a>&rsquo;s works focused on the relationship between line, color, and shape, which were employed to produce optical illusion. He also delved into abstract expressionism, and his works in this style revealed a frenzied spontaneity radically different from his more studied and analytical works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Cenon Rivera shifted to abstraction in 1951 after working in the academic style for years. He started experimenting with analytical cubism as seen in his <b><i>Wooden Shacks</i></b>, 1951, but acquired a distinctive style later when he blended semiabstract figuration using stained glass and mosaic techniques (Pilar 1994, 392).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\">Arturo Luz</a> utilized line as the basic structural element in his works, imbuing these with rhythm and movement as in Paul Klee&rsquo;s works. Luz utilized the rhythmic elegance of line, the poetry of tonal gradation, and the emphasis on sparseness in his more calligraphic works. His works, such as <b><i>Still Life with Bottle</i></b>, 1953, and <b><i>City</i></b>, 1960, had a sense of austerity evoked by the weightlessness of his lines and the restraint he practiced in the use of space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3696\">Victor Oteyza</a> also emphasized lines but his lines did not have any referential nor associative meaning (Torres 1992, 163). His <b><i>Plastic Engineering No. 13</i></b>, 1955, depicted lines in different colors that crisscross each other. The spontaneous placement of lines and color may look random but the overall composition reveals Oteyza&rsquo;s attention to balance and modulation, with the planes receding and advancing depending on the intensity of the colors used and the variation in the width of the lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another abstract artist was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel</a> whose florid and ebullient lines and shapes in works like <b><i><strong><strong>Bodegon</strong></strong> Antellano</i></b>, 1952 and 1953, contrast with Luz&rsquo;s lean lines. Like many modernists, Zobel also moved on to more abstract forms by the mid-1950s. Influenced by abstract expressionism, he utilized a hypodermic syringe instead of a brush to create random lines in his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2287\">Saeta</a> series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Abstract expressionist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3391\">Federico Aguilar Alcuaz</a> combined gestural abstraction with surrealism. He is identified with the nonfigurative movement in Barcelona, Spain. The nonfiguratives insisted on natural forms and recognizable motifs to counter the emotional and expressive lines of the Spanish formalists (Torres 1992, 196-97). The forms created by Alcuaz may have been discernable but they also had an aura of mystery about them, as though mined from another world. Depicted with dynamic and expressive brushstrokes and color, these forms evoke a surreal quality that is both powerful and enigmatic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3380\">Lee Aguinaldo</a>&rsquo;s works were influenced by the works of Jackson Pollock but he developed his own style called <b>flick painting</b> where he flicked paint from a palette onto the canvas. In his Galumphing<b><i> </i></b>series, he incorporated pop images influenced by Robert Motherwell and linear painting (Chu 1994, 303). He is also known for his linear paintings that combine the simplicity of lines with fluorescent colors, producing a pop art effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A young artist still in his teens in the 1950s, David Cortez Medalla explored <b>art brut</b>. Art brut was coined by Jean Dubuffet for art that should be spontaneous and unprocessed, unlike conventions of &ldquo;fine&rdquo; art. Medalla&rsquo;s works in the 1950s revealed this rawness. His <b><i>My Sister at the Sewing Machine</i></b>,<b> </b>1956, is like a child&rsquo;s painting with its spontaneous manner of coloring, absence of perspective, and random imaginary interpretation of the human face and anatomy. His works in this style did not gain much public attention at the time, but he would be recognized later in the 1960s for his kinetic sculptures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The insistence on art for art&rsquo;s sake may, at the outset, give the impression that the Neo-Realists were following a facet of modernism that assumed art&rsquo;s detachment from public expectation. On the contrary, however, Filipino artists working in the modernist idiom knew too well that their art could never achieve the kind of self-referential autonomy referred to by American art theorist Clement Greenberg. The history of modern art in the Philippines is a testament to how artists were beholden to the public and to the institutions that shaped them. While the intellectual elite and institutions favored this new mode of expression, the public was still wary of accepting this stream of art. It is said that for the public, the acceptable modernists were Manansala, Tabuena, and Magsaysay-Ho as they did not completely distort their figures and even referenced stock images of Philippine pastoral life (Torres 1992, 141). It would take another decade before the modernists would gain public acceptance. Their eventual validation in the 1960s was the result of the alliance between the modernists and influential institutions like the AAP and the PAG, which rallied behind them and supported their cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Alongside the search for a new way of expressing the tensions of the period was the continuing search for national identity. The independence of the Philippines from the USA in the postwar period also stirred nationalist sentiments reflected in the different modes of artistic expression. Riding the crest of this sentiment, the AAP required that 10 percent of the criteria for its competitions be devoted to the Filipino element of each entry. PAG artists deplored this criterion and argued that art&rsquo;s purpose was to engage in aesthetic issues and make people think. For them, &ldquo;the quality of work design was considered more important than painting carabaos, nipa huts and rice planting peasants&rdquo; (Torres 1992, 136). They believed that &ldquo;Filipinism not only distracted from producing a good work of art but was narrow-minded, parochial and even irrelevant&rdquo; (Torres 1992, 136). For them, modernism also meant internationalism and the more immediate problem was how their works would fare in the international art scene. The West remained the source of artistic influence for the Neo-Realists and the goal was to catch up with developments abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco was an exception in that in his lifetime, he upheld content and subject matter over form and utilized images that represented local identity. In fact, Botong not only embraced his nativism but &ldquo;flaunted it despite the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t fashionable anymore&rdquo; (Torres 1992, 136). In fact, it was perhaps due to this that he achieved cult status in his hometown of Angono and collectors would drive all the way from Manila to Angono just to buy his works (Torres 1992, 137). His figures were not tame nor were they abject; rather, they evoked a dynamic verve and dignity that was unlike any other. His works were expressionistic in approach and his themes were culled from Philippine history, customs, and folklore. Women were mythologized figures, such as Mariang Makiling and Princess Urduja, or contemporary women doing daily chores. The use of vibrant colors, curvilinear lines, and the sense of horror vacui in his works speak of the local temperament then. Botong created several murals of Philippine history, among which is <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2182\">Filipino Struggles through History</a> </i></b>for the Manila City Hall. Botong&rsquo;s influence has lived through the works of generations of Angono painters who have been influenced by his distinctive way of representing the folk.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modernists equated national identity with content, specifically images of carabaos and nipa huts, thereby disregarding the power and emotive effect of form that could be reworked to express the temperament of place and identity. But many of the artists working in the modernist style eventually developed their own brand of abstraction and showed how foreign influences could be tempered by the artist&rsquo;s sociohistorical experiences and cultural and artistic traditions. The type of cubism that Filipino artists harnessed was not the analytical cubism of Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris, which &ldquo;fragmented the figure into sharp facets in an austere monochromatic field but the cubism of the alter synthetic phase which showed broader planes and restored color harmonies and ornamental design and texture&rdquo; (Guillermo 1994, 57). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\">Alice Guillermo</a> argued that it was this synthetic phase that &ldquo;better suited the temperament of Filipinos and their penchant for color forms, ornamentation and flat composition covering the entire pictorial field&rdquo; (1994, 57). The transparent cubism of Manansala, Tabuena, and Legaspi are said to be evocative of the sheer and crystalline qualities of capiz (oyster shell) windows, pi&ntilde;a (pineapple fiber), jusi, the Christmas <b>parol</b><i> </i>(lantern), the Pahiyas <b>kiping</b> (rice wafer), and colorful <i>pastillas </i>(milk candy) wrappers (Guillermo 1994, 57). The human figure is also not completely or severely distorted to evince a sense of the familiar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, the debate between the conservatives and the modernists were not confined to gallery and coffee-shop talks or academic quibbles. Edades and Tolentino fought it out in several verbal tussles in <b><i>This Week</i></b> and the <b><i>Sunday Times Magazine </i></b>in Jul 1948. The public also joined the debate. A Dominican priest labeled modernist works &ldquo;products of a warped mind&rdquo; (Torres 1992, 122). Journalists and poets, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5036\">Aurelio S. Alvero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3488\">E. Aguilar Cruz</a>, Armando Manalo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5252\">Ricaredo Demetillo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo Perez III</a>, Fernando Zobel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3444\">Leonidas Benesa</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3803\">Emmanuel Torres</a>, comprised the intellectual elite and they rallied behind the modernists (Torres 1992, 122, 124). In an attempt to placate the conservatives, the AAP set up two divisions of entries to their annual competition. This strategy eventually proved futile. In 1955, the AAP held its semiannual competition and exhibition at the Northern Motors showroom in Manila. A few minutes after the ribbon cutting, conservatives took down their entries from the walls, walked out of the showroom, and displayed their works on the sidewalk across the street. The conservatives did this to protest the perceived bias of the jury in awarding all the Rotary Club Golden Anniversary awards to modernists Galo Ocampo, Manuel Rodriguez Sr, and Vicente Manansala (Torres 1992, 127). After this historic incident, the conservatives set up their own galleries in the Mabini area catering mostly to tourists. Since it had become moot after the walkout, the AAP abandoned the double criteria track in 1959.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For some observers, the walkout signaled the victory for the modernists who, by this time, had secured their place in the mainstream art world. But the conservatives did not disappear into oblivion as many historical accounts of postwar art are wont to portray. The conservatives eventually created their own art world that was as vibrant and lucrative as the art world of the modernists. Those who walked out of the AAP competition formed an organization called the Academy of Filipino Artists and held their own annual exhibitions at the Luneta Park in front of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> (Tan 2013). When the members of this organization drifted apart, some set up their own studios and art shops in the Mabini area. Other artists followed later, and together they formed a new group called the Mabini Artists&rsquo; Association.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In her seminal work on Mabini art, art scholar Pearl Tan identifies three generations of Mabini artists. The first generation consisted of artists who hewed closely to the style of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> and painted idyllic pastoral scenes. They started painting in the late 1940s and became established in the 1950s. Artists belonging to this generation are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3495\">Gabriel Custodio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3768\">Simon Saulog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3555\">Miguel Galvez</a>, Cesar Buenaventura, Cesar Amorsolo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3772\">Serafin Serna</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3384\">Ben Alano</a>, and Fermin V. Sanchez. The works of these artists sold well especially among tourists. Mabini art became even more popular as continued urbanization in the 1950s and 1960s led to the demand for decorative items for newly constructed buildings. It should be noted that while the first-generation artists worked in the conservative style, some experimented with modernist techniques. For instance, Miguel Galvez worked in various styles from naturalism to impressionism, post-impressionism, and expressionism (Tan 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The second-generation Mabini artists started actively painting in the 1960s and were 20-30 years younger than the first-generation artists. Unlike the all-male composition of the first generation, women artists like Emy Lopez and Rexi Gonzales were part of this second generation (Tan 2013). The academy had disbanded by this time but most of the members continued to work in shops along Mabini and nearby streets. Galleries and shops such as the Emy Lopez Art Gallery, the Philippine Art Gallery of Zablan, the Contemporary Art Gallery of Paco Gorospe, the Manila Art Gallery of Asing Wong, Jon&rsquo;s Photography, and Art Gallery of J. Pulido were owned by artists who sold their works and acted as dealers themselves (Tan 2013). The second-generation artists did not confine themselves to the conservative style of Amorsolo but began experimenting with modernist techniques of abstraction. Their subject matter also became more eclectic. They added urban street scenes to the typical rural scenes and painted themes like the Last Supper, nudes, seascapes, still lifes, sports, domesticated animals, and sensational scenes copied from the cover of bestselling pocketbooks (Tan 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The third generation consisted of artists working in the area of Mabini in the 1970s. They were mostly freelance artists, such as fine arts students or hard-up artists striving to be recognized in the mainstream art world. Artists of this generation reverted back to the conservative style (Tan 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The works of Mabini artists conform to the tastes and standards set by dealers and clients. Many artists had to churn out works in large numbers to satisfy client demand. This is one of the reasons why mainstream artists look down on Mabini artists whose works, they believe, are formulaic and made primarily for commerce. It can be argued that it is not fair to judge the works of Mabini artists using the norms set by mainstream art, and that Mabini art has its own aesthetic criteria, which is &ldquo;the appreciation of the sensuous qualities and skillful execution of painting rather than the intellectualization of art&rdquo; (Tan 2013). Mabini artists also had loyal patrons consisting of wealthy local scions and tourists. Don Andres Soriano and Don Joaquin Elizalde were Gabriel Custodio&rsquo;s patrons for many years and they commissioned him to travel all over the Philippines to paint Filipino scenes. Mabini artists also received sponsorship from companies who brought their exhibitions to other countries. In 1955, the Travelling World Tour Exhibit sponsored by De La Rama Steamship Co. Inc brought the works of the Academy of Filipino Artists to the USA, Latin America, Hong Kong, and Japan. Miguel Galvez and Lucino Alejandrino exhibited in 1959 at the Philippine consulate in Hawaii (Tan 2013). Through these tours, artists like Custodio were also able to develop a clientele abroad. The history of postwar art and beyond therefore reveals the coexistence of differing art worlds where different aesthetic norms and standards were used to satisfy clients with diverse tastes and predilections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early 1960s witnessed the opening of two new galleries that were to supplant the PAG&mdash;the Contemporary Art Gallery of Manuel Rodriguez Sr and the stylish Luz Gallery of Arturo Luz in Makati. The Contemporary Art Gallery became the venue for original fine prints while the Luz Gallery replaced the PAG as Manila&rsquo;s premier gallery (Torres 1992, 132). At this time, PAG&rsquo;s influence began to wane due to competition from these two galleries, dwindling finances, and Arguilla&rsquo;s failing health. The PAG finally closed down in 1968.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1960s also saw the rise to prominence of second-generation modernists such as Jose Joya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\">Ang Kiukok</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3643\">Mauro Malang Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3422\">Antonio Austria</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3402\">Angelito Antonio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3443\">BenCab</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3762\">Juvenal Sanso</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose Joya was the leading abstract expressionist of this period, producing large action paintings. He applied paint spontaneously on the canvas in large, broad strokes with a brush or spatula, or squeezed paint directly from a tube onto canvas. The colors he used were bold, his lines and brush strokes were broad yet rhythmic and dynamic. Texture is conveyed by using rough impasto finish mixed with sand, as in his monumental work <b><i>Granadean Arabesque</i></b>, 1958. Though spontaneous, Joya&rsquo;s works always displayed a keen sense of balance between improvisation and studied elegance. From spontaneous, expressive brushstrokes and colors, Joya&rsquo;s later works revealed a more organized composition featuring rounded overlapping shapes. Joya represented the Philippines in the 1964 Venice Bienniale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ang Kiukok developed his distinctive style during the 1960s after having been influenced by the works of Manansala. His early works consisted of somber landscapes and monochromatic still life. Even in his early works, Kiukok&rsquo;s images evoked solitude and bleakness evident in subjects like skeletons, empty cabinets, or doors and windows looking out at desolate landscapes (Coseteng 1992, 207). In time, his images began to take on a more visceral approach. His colors became bolder and brighter and his figures more distorted. After his trip to the USA in 1965, the images he painted became even more expressive of anguish and frustration, and were at times even tinged with macabre humor (Coseteng 1992, 209). During this period, he painted robots, skeletons inside a box, and animals that look menacing. It was in the 1960s that Ang Kiukok created the convulsive images of his Crucifixion series, which portrayed pain, angst, suffering, and violence. The distorted wrenching figure of Christ was later reduced to even more abstract forms. Ang Kiukok&rsquo;s images that are at once cynical and disturbing make up powerful statements of human struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among those who were influenced by Manansala&rsquo;s Filipino vision of city life were Mauro Malang Santos, Antonio Austria, and Angelito Antonio. Malang Santos was an illustrator and cartoonist who ventured into painting in the 1960s. His works in the late 1960s were a microcosm of Philippine life, which portrayed the town plaza, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/244\">church</a>, and groups of people engaged in different activities. Later, he expanded his subject to include urbanscapes, birds, flowers, and religious icons (Coseteng 1992, 202). Malang&rsquo;s images are geometricized and arranged in overlapping planes with a predominance of primary colors such as red, yellow, and blue. His stylization is not analytical and rigorous, but often exudes a light, playful quality not unlike his cartoons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Antonio Austria rendered various subject matter from urban to rural sceneries, images of the elite and ordinary people, to jeepneys, folk games, and fiestas. He did not completely distort his figures but rendered them as short and rotund with &ldquo;flat tubular limbs and stubby hands and feet&rdquo; (Guillermo and Villar 1994, 315). Horror vacui is also evident in his works as he covers spaces with different shapes and colors. The flatness of his composition, simplicity of execution, and the use of cheerful colors lend a disarming naivete to his works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Angelito Antonio depicted ordinary folks such as vendors, peddlers, and cockfighters. A more simplistic approach to cubism is apparent in his use of simple, fine lines that subtly cut his figures&rsquo; cheekbones or delineate the creases on their clothes. Antonio also used black charcoal instead of color as structuring device (Guillermo 1994, 309).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The works of these artists show that the idioms of the conservatives, after all, were not entirely abandoned, and that many of the modernists harked back to the familiar and the pastoral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another young artist at the time was Benedicto Cabrera aka BenCab. BenCab&rsquo;s first show was in 1960 at the Indigo Art Gallery in Ermita (Guillermo 1994, 324). A series that distinguished BenCab&rsquo;s body of work consisted of images culled from colonial period postcards, which he found as he was sifting through antique and thrift shops in London. Called the Larawan series, these works demonstrate the artist&rsquo;s deft mining of embedded meaning made engaging through creative cropping and witty composition. Other works consisted of paintings of scavengers, derelicts, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/221\"><i>barong-barong</i></a> (shanty). He also did numerous sketches of an iconic character he named Sabel. These were drawn after a scavenger who used to roam the streets of Bambang where the artist lived. BenCab was fascinated with the plastic sheets that Sabel wrapped around her body, which made beautiful abstract shapes (Reyes 1989, 156).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, Juvenal Sanso developed his own surrealistic style in depicting landscapes, rock forms, seascapes, bamboo fish traps, and lichens. His subject matter is oftentimes recognizable, but his detailing of life forms that flourish in deserted places and the colors he uses to do this enable his work to take on a dreamlike quality. In the meantime, Federico Alcuaz, who had been in Barcelona since 1954, came home to hold an exhibition at the Luz Gallery in 1964. Zobel, on the other hand, shifted to a more serene and restrained type of abstraction. This decade saw his fascination with Chinese characters that he reduced to their basic visual elements (Coseteng 1992, 197).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Napoleon Abueva&rsquo;s AAP-winning sculpture <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2212\"><strong>Kaganapan</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1953, may well represent the ambivalence wrought upon the Filipino artist negotiating with traditional figuration and themes alongside exploratory processes using a variety of materials. Abueva would also become known for functional sculptures, such as playground pieces found at Luneta Park and lobby benches at the University of the Philippines Palma Hall lobby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With Abueva as leader, other sculptors rose to prominence during the decade, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\">Abdulmari Imao</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3767\">Solomon Saprid</a>, J. Elizalde Navarro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3580\">Lamberto Hechanova</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3523\">Edgar Doctor</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\">David Medalla</a>, Arturo Luz, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3469\">Eduardo Castrillo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imao&rsquo;s stylized renderings, like <b><i>Anito Assembly</i></b>, and his long-running series invoking Islamic iconic references, like the crescent moon and <b>sarimanok</b>, make up his seminal contribution to three-dimensional forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Saprid has long been associated with his heavily textured <i>tikbalang</i> (Philippine mythological figure that is half-human and half-horse) figures with their stretched out metal presence either hovering or thrusting themselves toward viewers. These sculptors created <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblages</a> that invoked a tactile order that challenged not only the dominance of vision but created a different artistic experience that was contingent, interactive, and intellectual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">J. Elizalde Navarro was known for his masks made from hardwood, which merged human and animal forms. He also created sculptures using rods and pipes and assemblages of found objects and metal parts, the best known of these works being <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2198\"><strong>Homage to Dodgie Laurel</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1969<b><i> </i></b>(Guillermo 1994, 376).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lamberto Hechanova used aluminum and transparent plexiglass with wood (Guillermo 1992, 326). Some of his works were made of cubes and blocks of aluminum wrapped around colorful, twisted metal parts at their core. The design in the center breaks the monotony of the steely cold surface of the industrial materials as well as the rigid regularity of these boxes and cubes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Edgar Doctor did assemblages in relief and in the round using found objects such as metal parts, cogs, wheels, cylinders, and toys. In <b><i>Economic Aggression</i></b>, 1972, different metal parts were assembled around an armature and framed by vertical metal sheets stamped with holes that look like skyscrapers. The metal parts take up the uppermost portion of the piece, their mass and weight encroaching on the lower portion of the visual field. He also created assemblages using tattered toys to evoke a sense of nostalgia (Guillermo 1992, 327).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, David Medalla became known for his auto creative sculptures and kinetic art. His <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2155\"><b><i>Bubble Machine</i></b></a> and <b><i>Smoke Machine</i></b> were shown at the exhibition <b><i>Structures Vivantes: Mobiles/Images</i></b> at the Redfern Gallery in London, 1963 (Nankervis 2014). His <b><i>Bubble Machine</i></b> created beautiful forms and his <b><i>Sand Machine </i></b>traced forms in sand on a round dish. He also created <b><i>Olfactory <strong>Sculpture</strong></i></b> using different types of perfume. Medalla&rsquo;s works, which are evocative of this personal experiences, have been described as prime examples of kineticism and a creative way of redefining physical forces and stable and unstable units. Medalla left the country in 1960 and has since lived in London while visiting the Philippines intermittently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Still another artist, Arturo Luz, made several distinctively modern sculptures during this period when the iconic architectural markers of martial law were built up. Among these minimalist abstract pieces are those found at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, the Philippine International Convention Center, along with later pieces installed within the Makati business district and at the Ateneo Art Gallery. Luz&rsquo;s sculptures, much like his linear paintings, displayed a clarity of vision, restraint, and playfulness. He transformed wood into graceful geometric shapes with beveled corners. He also bent pipes and steel to create playful forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another sculptor whose works were beginning to catch the attention of the public then was Eduardo Castrillo. Castrillo started producing sculptures for memorial parks in the 1960s, his most remembered work in this vein being <b><i>Pieta</i></b> for the Loyola Memorial Park. These works were characteristically big, outdoor sculptures that blended with their environment, their faceted surfaces and sheer size eliciting a sense of awe.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from painting and sculpture, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a> was making headway in the art scene in the 1960s. Even before this decade, Manuel Rodriguez Sr had already introduced serigraphy or silkscreen in 1948 through his small gallery that served as outlet for the works of his students (Guillermo 1994, 394). He also introduced woodblock printing and silkscreens, which he demonstrated in public in AAP&rsquo;s <b><i>Art in Action</i></b> held at the Northern Motors showroom on UN Ave (Harding 1974, 36). Rodriguez also introduced printmaking through greeting cards. Other artists like Cenon Rivera and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3478\">Florencio Concepcion</a> also did serigraphy, creating beautiful designs for the PAG Christmas cards in the early 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1959 and 1960, Boyd Compton, a representative of the Rockefeller Foundation, visited Manila to invite Filipino artists to study printmaking in the USA. Manuel Rodriguez Sr answered the call and underwent workshop training in New York through a Rockefeller grant, at about the same time <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3702\">Rodolfo Paras-Perez</a> was also training in printmaking in the USA. Rodriguez came home in 1962 and actively promoted printmaking in the Philippines. In the same year, Rodriguez opened the Contemporary Arts Gallery at 1416 A. Mabini St. Rodriguez&rsquo;s <b><i>The Traveller</i></b>, 1961, which was done at the Pratt Institute, and <b><i>Nipa Hut Madonna</i></b>, 1972, show his skill in transforming an engraving into something that looks like a painting. He explored genre themes such as pastoral scenes, festivals, and ethnic ideographs (Benesa 1992, 352).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In addition to being an artist, Rodriguez was revered as a teacher who tirelessly tried to convert as many people to the democratizing cause of printmaking. His students cut across different sectors in society and consisted of college students, matrons, as well as those with hearing and speaking disabilities (Benesa 1992, 353). During this period, graphic arts was also introduced in the curriculum of the Philippine Women&rsquo;s College where Rodriguez taught. His students then were woodcut artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3654\">Lucio Martinez</a> as well as Lamberto Hechanova and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3531\">Restituto Embuscado</a> (Benesa 1992, 355). In 1963, the American embassy brought an exhibition of 40 works by leading American printmakers to Manila and Cebu and this presumably further stimulated printmaking among an even broader set of artists (Benesa 1992, 352).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, Paras-Perez reaped awards in both local and international art competitions. He won first and second places at the semiannual print competition of the AAP in 1963 and was elected member of the College of Professors of the Academia della Arti del Disegno in Florence, Italy (Benesa 1992, 354). His xylograph <b><i><strong>One</strong> Way Corner</i></b> won a gold medal at the International Graphic Art Exhibition in Italy in 1967. It is said that while Rodriguez introduced printmaking through workshops, Paras-Perez wielded influence through his exhibitions (Benesa 1992, 354). In the late 1960s, Filipino printmakers also made their presence felt in the Tokyo Print Biennial (Benesa 1992, 358). In 1968, with Rodriguez at the helm, Filipino printmakers got together and formed the Philippine Association of Printmakers based in the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University. Three of Rodriguez&rsquo;s sons, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3744\">Manuel Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3746\">Marcelino</a>, and Ray, were to become respected names in the field of printmaking. The mid-1960s saw the rise of younger print artists, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\">Virgilio Aviado</a> who explored a wide variety of subject matter such as images of <i>santo</i> (saints), sociopolitical themes, explorations of the psyche, the surreal, and even the occult.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1966, the CCP was created through Executive Order 30. It was formally inaugurated on 8 Sep 1969 and was the most visible symbol of state patronage at the time. It was a flagship project of then First Lady Imelda Marcos and was conceived as a government institution created to provide support for Filipino arts and culture. Under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a> and later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3385\">Raymundo Albano</a>, the CCP opened its exhibition programming to works influenced by the Western avant-garde and conceptual tenets, pop art, happenings, environmental assemblages, new realism, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">performance</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2117\">sound works</a> (Gatbonton 1992, 211). Chabet&rsquo;s first exhibit was at the Luz Gallery in 1961. His own works were avowedly conceptual, emphasizing the idea behind his art rather than technique and form. Eventually calling himself a Flux artist, he did collages, drawings, sculptures, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a> using found objects. Also among his and Albano&rsquo;s lasting contributions was the opening up of nonwhite cube sites for art exhibitions and performance spaces, such as the short-lived <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3773\">Shop 6</a> in Cubao, and later in one of the stalls of the Kamalig arcade in Manila. This shifting to alternative venues was also accompanied by the development of emergent art writing platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The popular art scene was equally lively in the post-World War II era. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">Komiks</a> became a popular form of entertainment especially for the masses due to its low cost. After the war, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a> revived his comic strips <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a> </i></b>and <b><i>Ponyang Halobaybay </i></b>in <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> </i></b>magazine.<b> <i>Halakhak </i></b>komiks came out right after the war to entertain Filipinos who needed a respite from the hardship. On 27 May 1947, Velasquez and Ramon Roces organized Ace Publications and published <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b>. The komiks featured the works of Velasquez, Manansala, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\">Larry Alcala</a>, Jose Zabala, Damian Velasquez, Jesse Santos, Tony Roullo, E.D. Ramos, Fred Carillo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3645\">A.Y. Manalad</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3833\">Hugo Yonzon</a>. This was followed by <b><i>Tagalog Klasiks </i></b>in 1949, <b><i>Hiwaga Komiks</i></b> in 1950, <b><i>Espesyal Komiks</i></b> and <b><i>Kenkoy Komiks</i></b> in 1952. It is believed that the comic books brought in by American GIs when they returned to fight the Japanese in 1945 influenced the format adopted by local komiks and hastened its development (Guillermo and Cajipe-Endaya 1994, 108; Roxas and Arevalo<i> </i>1985, 11).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other komiks publishing outfits soon rose to join the lucrative industry, such as Extra Komiks Publications, G. Miranda and Sons Publishing Corporation, Bulaklak Publications, Soller Press, and Gold Star Publishing House. In the 1960s, Atlas Publishing Co., run by the Roces clan, published many of the most popular novels of the period such as <b><i>Bittersweet</i></b>,<b><i> Maruja</i></b>,<b><i> <strong>Halik</strong> sa Hangin</i></b> (Kiss in the Wind), and <b><i>Alupihang Dagat</i></b> (Sea Centipede). The love-drama-action combination of these novels along with the inclusion of movie columns appealed to a wide readership (Roxas and Arevalo<i> </i>1985, 31). Graphic Arts Service Inc (GASI) was organized on 1 Aug 1962 and run by Damian Velasquez and his brother Tony. GASI published <b><i>Kislap Komiks</i></b>,<b><i> Pioneer Komiks</i></b>,<b><i> <strong>Aliw</strong>an Komiks</i></b>,<b><i> Pinoy Komiks</i></b>,<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1486\"><strong>Pinoy Klasiks</strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>Holiday Komiks</i></b>. Their publications featured works by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\">Mars Ravelo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3477\">Francisco Coching</a>, and Velasquez, among others. In 1963, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5339\">Pablo S. Gomez</a>, who was formerly an editor of Ace Publications, set up his own company called PSG Publishing House. In 1970, Ravelo organized his own RAR Publishing House. RAR&rsquo;s komiks were different because they were bigger in format than the other komiks being published at the time (Roxas and Arevalo 1985, 25).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After World War II, komiks stories began to veer away from humorous themes. Most of the stories now dealt with romance/fantasy or realistic themes. Realistic themes dealt with real-life heroes and situations but were often laced with elements of romance or fantasy. It was rare for a realist series to be sustained because of the happy ending syndrome characteristic of komiks in circulation during this period (Reyes 1984, 50). The ability of these stories to provide escape from reality through illusionary and fantasy themes while anchoring these on aspects of the real world added to their appeal. The illustrations provided the readers with a visualization of what they could only imagine from reading prose (Reyes 1984, 49). The illustrations in these komiks generally followed two drawing traditions: the realistic and the romantic. The realistic style was usually utilized in stories dealing with contemporary issues and problems in society (Guillermo 1994, 110). Ordinary people were depicted with ordinary qualities such as the characters in Ravelo&rsquo;s <b><i>Roberta</i></b> and in Pablo Gomez and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3732\">Nestor Redondo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Batang Bangkusay</i></b> (Guillermo 1994, 110). The romantic style is exemplified by the works of Coching and is characterized by the depiction of handsome heroes and beautiful heroines. The heroes were usually depicted as tall, mestizo or with Malay looks, and with curly hair and rippling muscles (Guillermo 1994, 110). The women, on the other hand, had curvaceous bodies and long curly tresses. In the 1960s, pornographic komiks, called <b>bomba</b> <b>komiks</b>, with graphic and sensual illustrations of the human anatomy proliferated and were published by fly-by-night publishers (Reyes 1984, 50).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The post-World War II era was also one of Philippine journalism&rsquo;s most active periods. The leading editorial cartoonists of the decade were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3593\">Esmeraldo &ldquo;EZ&rdquo; Izon</a> of the<b><i> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></i></b>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3568\">Liborio Gatbonton</a> of the <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, Demetrio Diego of the <b><i>Daily <strong><strong>Mirror</strong></strong></i></b>, and Bert Gallardo of the<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b>. Isaac Tolentino, who was then art director of the<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b> would substitute for Gallardo in the latter&rsquo;s absence. Among them, Izon had the longest career that spanned the pre- and postwar periods. He started working as editorial cartoonist in the 1930s, doing the page-one editorial cartoon of the <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3712\">Jose Pereira</a>. The works of these editorial cartoonists harnessed the techniques of distortion in varying degrees. Izon&rsquo;s and Gallardo&rsquo;s works were tamer than Gatbonton&rsquo;s cartoons, which utilized extreme exaggeration. In Izon&rsquo;s works, the diminution and exaggeration of body size to add comic relief was used sparingly. Gallardo&rsquo;s cartoons were more literal and straightforward, and techniques of distortion were rarely used. In contrast, Gatbonton portrayed &ldquo;bad guys&rdquo; with ugly and grossly exaggerated facial features. Diego was very adept in wordplay and produced witty cartoons that combined caricatures with humorous texts. Corky Trinidad joined the<b><i> Philippines Herald </i></b>in 1961. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\">Danilo Dalena</a>&rsquo;s cartoons appeared in the <b><i>Philippines Free Press </i></b>in the late 1960s and in <b><i>Asia-Philippines Leader </i></b>in the early 1970s. Trinidad and Dalena were known for their cartoons providing pointed commentary as these tackled social and political issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The immediate postwar period up to the early 1970s was indeed a dynamic period that nurtured diverse artistic forms and styles and an active art market. Modern art served the intellectual and the cultural elite while Mabini art catered to tourists and those who still preferred representational paintings. Both streams of practice satisfied the growing population of fetishistic collectors. Komiks provided the masses with a convenient escape from the harsh realities of life while editorial cartoons gave newspaper readers insights into the period&rsquo;s most controversial headlines. However, the 1960s was also fraught with political tension, and beneath the bustle of artistic activities were the rumblings of discontent and warnings of a looming political crisis. As the 1970s began, a new era rife with political friction was ushered in. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><strong>Related Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\" target=\"_self\">Installation and Site-Specific Art</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\" target=\"_self\">Komiks and Editorial Cartoon</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\" target=\"_self\">Painting and Related Forms</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\" target=\"_self\">Printmaking</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\" target=\"_self\">Sculpture</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Sourceline\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\">Sources</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Beller, Jonathan L. 1999. &ldquo;Nationalism in Scenes and Spaces of H.R.

				"value": "The period opened up opportunities for Filipino artists to study abroad, which exposed them to new trends in the West. Many Filipino artists went to Spain, France, Italy, Canada, and the United States on travel and study grants. An important publication that fueled the popularity of modern art among Filipino artists was <b><i>Life </i></b>magazine, which was brought into the country after the war (Torres 1992, 117). <b><i>Life</i></b> magazine featured the works of Picasso, Braque, Chagall, Kandinsky, Mondrian, Buffet, and Dubuffet, and the New York abstract expressionists (Torres 1992, 117). Having been exposed to these trends, the modernists took Edades&#x2019;s prewar post-Impressionist style toward abstraction. Artists who were working in this style and direction were referred to as the Neo-Realists. Artists of this movement were <a href=\"/3/3/3686\">Hernando R.

While Tolentino&#x2019;s style was classical and romantic, Abueva&#x2019;s works denied idealization, utilizing slight distortion and elongation as he trained his attention on plastic form. He transformed <a href=\"/3/16/2121\">materials</a> such as wood and stone into forms that were sensuous and playful. His <b><i>Allegorical Harpoon</i></b>, 1964, and <b><i>Alabaster City</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1971, reveal his foray into stylization and abstraction. Abueva&#x2019;s large body of work done in a wide spectrum of materials and diverse sculptural language demonstrate his consistent desire to challenge conventions while he explored the malleable qualities of the material at hand. This tenacity and his rearing of several generations of subsequent sculptors through his teaching at the University of the Philippines led to Abueva&#x2019;s being recognized as the youngest recipient of the National Artist Award."

In the visual arts, art for art&#x2019;s sake became one of the impetus in the development of abstraction. Abstract art, in its insistence on freedom of self-expression and form rather than content, took the direction of art for art&#x2019;s sake where the purpose was to produce art for its own sake and not for any edifying, utilitarian, or moral lessons. The Neo-Realists regarded plastic reality rather than mimetic representation as more important and insisted that a work should be judged by how it holds up as design rather than as portrayal of reality in every detail (Torres 1992, 118)."

Jonathan Beller, in his article on H.R. Ocampo&#x2019;s works, argues that this type of visuality, which is not subservient to a signifier, offered a realm of freedom (Beller 2004, 32). Therefore, H.R.

On the contrary, however, Filipino artists working in the modernist idiom knew too well that their art could never achieve the kind of self-referential autonomy referred to by American art theorist Clement Greenberg. The history of modern art in the Philippines is a testament to how artists were beholden to the public and to the institutions that shaped them. While the intellectual elite and institutions favored this new mode of expression, the public was still wary of accepting this stream of art. It is said that for the public, the acceptable modernists were Manansala, Tabuena, and Magsaysay-Ho as they did not completely distort their figures and even referenced stock images of Philippine pastoral life (Torres 1992, 141).

PAG artists deplored this criterion and argued that art&#x2019;s purpose was to engage in aesthetic issues and make people think. For them, &#x201C;the quality of work design was considered more important than painting carabaos, nipa huts and rice planting peasants&#x201D; (Torres 1992, 136). They believed that &#x201C;Filipinism not only distracted from producing a good work of art but was narrow-minded, parochial and even irrelevant&#x201D; (Torres 1992, 136).

In fact, it was perhaps due to this that he achieved cult status in his hometown of Angono and collectors would drive all the way from Manila to Angono just to buy his works (Torres 1992, 137). His figures were not tame nor were they abject; rather, they evoked a dynamic verve and dignity that was unlike any other. His works were expressionistic in approach and his themes were culled from Philippine history, customs, and folklore. Women were mythologized figures, such as Mariang Makiling and Princess Urduja, or contemporary women doing daily chores. The use of vibrant colors, curvilinear lines, and the sense of horror vacui in his works speak of the local temperament then. Botong created several murals of Philippine history, among which is <b><i><a href=\"/3/82/2182\">Filipino Struggles through History</a> </i></b>for the Manila City Hall. Botong&#x2019;s influence has lived through the works of generations of Angono painters who have been influenced by his distinctive way of representing the folk."

The type of cubism that Filipino artists harnessed was not the analytical cubism of Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris, which &#x201C;fragmented the figure into sharp facets in an austere monochromatic field but the cubism of the alter synthetic phase which showed broader planes and restored color harmonies and ornamental design and texture&#x201D; (Guillermo 1994, 57). <a href=\"/3/17/3575\">Alice Guillermo</a> argued that it was this synthetic phase that &#x201C;better suited the temperament of Filipinos and their penchant for color forms, ornamentation and flat composition covering the entire pictorial field&#x201D; (1994, 57).

Aguilar Cruz</a>, Armando Manalo, <a href=\"/9/80/5059\">Francisco Arcellana</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5252\">Ricaredo Demetillo</a>, <a href=\"/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo Perez III</a>, Fernando Zobel, <a href=\"/3/17/3444\">Leonidas Benesa</a>, and <a href=\"/3/17/3803\">Emmanuel Torres</a>, comprised the intellectual elite and they rallied behind the modernists (Torres 1992, 122, 124). In an attempt to placate the conservatives, the AAP set up two divisions of entries to their annual competition. This strategy eventually proved futile. In 1955, the AAP held its semiannual competition and exhibition at the Northern Motors showroom in Manila. A few minutes after the ribbon cutting, conservatives took down their entries from the walls, walked out of the showroom, and displayed their works on the sidewalk across the street. The conservatives did this to protest the perceived bias of the jury in awarding all the Rotary Club Golden Anniversary awards to modernists Galo Ocampo, Manuel Rodriguez Sr, and Vicente Manansala (Torres 1992, 127). After this historic incident, the conservatives set up their own galleries in the Mabini area catering mostly to tourists. Since it had become moot after the walkout, the AAP abandoned the double criteria track in 1959."

But the conservatives did not disappear into oblivion as many historical accounts of postwar art are wont to portray. The conservatives eventually created their own art world that was as vibrant and lucrative as the art world of the modernists. Those who walked out of the AAP competition formed an organization called the Academy of Filipino Artists and held their own annual exhibitions at the Luneta Park in front of the <a href=\"/2/8/335\">Manila Hotel</a> (Tan 2013). When the members of this organization drifted apart, some set up their own studios and art shops in the Mabini area.

They started painting in the late 1940s and became established in the 1950s. Artists belonging to this generation are <a href=\"/3/17/3495\">Gabriel Custodio</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3768\">Simon Saulog</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3555\">Miguel Galvez</a>, Cesar Buenaventura, Cesar Amorsolo, <a href=\"/3/17/3772\">Serafin Serna</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3384\">Ben Alano</a>, and Fermin V. Sanchez. The works of these artists sold well especially among tourists. Mabini art became even more popular as continued urbanization in the 1950s and 1960s led to the demand for decorative items for newly constructed buildings. It should be noted that while the first-generation artists worked in the conservative style, some experimented with modernist techniques. For instance, Miguel Galvez worked in various styles from naturalism to impressionism, post-impressionism, and expressionism (Tan 2013)."

Unlike the all-male composition of the first generation, women artists like Emy Lopez and Rexi Gonzales were part of this second generation (Tan 2013). The academy had disbanded by this time but most of the members continued to work in shops along Mabini and nearby streets. Galleries and shops such as the Emy Lopez Art Gallery, the Philippine Art Gallery of Zablan, the Contemporary Art Gallery of Paco Gorospe, the Manila Art Gallery of Asing Wong, Jon&#x2019;s Photography, and Art Gallery of J. Pulido were owned by artists who sold their works and acted as dealers themselves (Tan 2013). The second-generation artists did not confine themselves to the conservative style of Amorsolo but began experimenting with modernist techniques of abstraction. Their subject matter also became more eclectic. They added urban street scenes to the typical rural scenes and painted themes like the Last Supper, nudes, seascapes, still lifes, sports, domesticated animals, and sensational scenes copied from the cover of bestselling pocketbooks (Tan 2013)."

				"value": "The works of Mabini artists conform to the tastes and standards set by dealers and clients. Many artists had to churn out works in large numbers to satisfy client demand. This is one of the reasons why mainstream artists look down on Mabini artists whose works, they believe, are formulaic and made primarily for commerce. It can be argued that it is not fair to judge the works of Mabini artists using the norms set by mainstream art, and that Mabini art has its own aesthetic criteria, which is &#x201C;the appreciation of the sensuous qualities and skillful execution of painting rather than the intellectualization of art&#x201D; (Tan 2013). Mabini artists also had loyal patrons consisting of wealthy local scions and tourists. Don Andres Soriano and Don Joaquin Elizalde were Gabriel Custodio&#x2019;s patrons for many years and they commissioned him to travel all over the Philippines to paint Filipino scenes. Mabini artists also received sponsorship from companies who brought their exhibitions to other countries. In 1955, the Travelling World Tour Exhibit sponsored by De La Rama Steamship Co. Inc brought the works of the Academy of Filipino Artists to the USA, Latin America, Hong Kong, and Japan. Miguel Galvez and Lucino Alejandrino exhibited in 1959 at the Philippine consulate in Hawaii (Tan 2013). Through these tours, artists like Custodio were also able to develop a clientele abroad. The history of postwar art and beyond therefore reveals the coexistence of differing art worlds where different aesthetic norms and standards were used to satisfy clients with diverse tastes and predilections."

Texture is conveyed by using rough impasto finish mixed with sand, as in his monumental work <b><i>Granadean Arabesque</i></b>, 1958. Though spontaneous, Joya&#x2019;s works always displayed a keen sense of balance between improvisation and studied elegance.

Even in his early works, Kiukok&#x2019;s images evoked solitude and bleakness evident in subjects like skeletons, empty cabinets, or doors and windows looking out at desolate landscapes (Coseteng 1992, 207). In time, his images began to take on a more visceral approach. His colors became bolder and brighter and his figures more distorted. After his trip to the USA in 1965, the images he painted became even more expressive of anguish and frustration, and were at times even tinged with macabre humor (Coseteng 1992, 209). During this period, he painted robots, skeletons inside a box, and animals that look menacing. It was in the 1960s that Ang Kiukok created the convulsive images of his Crucifixion series, which portrayed pain, angst, suffering, and violence. The distorted wrenching figure of Christ was later reduced to even more abstract forms. Ang Kiukok&#x2019;s images that are at once cynical and disturbing make up powerful statements of human struggle."

Later, he expanded his subject to include urbanscapes, birds, flowers, and religious icons (Coseteng 1992, 202). Malang&#x2019;s images are geometricized and arranged in overlapping planes with a predominance of primary colors such as red, yellow, and blue.

Other works consisted of paintings of scavengers, derelicts, and the <a href=\"/2/5/221\"><i>barong-barong</i></a> (shanty). He also did numerous sketches of an iconic character he named Sabel. These were drawn after a scavenger who used to roam the streets of Bambang where the artist lived.

In the meantime, Federico Alcuaz, who had been in Barcelona since 1954, came home to hold an exhibition at the Luz Gallery in 1964. Zobel, on the other hand, shifted to a more serene and restrained type of abstraction.

It was a flagship project of then First Lady Imelda Marcos and was conceived as a government institution created to provide support for Filipino arts and culture. Under <a href=\"/3/17/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a> and later <a href=\"/3/17/3385\">Raymundo Albano</a>, the CCP opened its exhibition programming to works influenced by the Western avant-garde and conceptual tenets, pop art, happenings, environmental assemblages, new realism, <a href=\"/3/15/2111\">performance</a>, and <a href=\"/3/15/2117\">sound works</a> (Gatbonton 1992, 211). Chabet&#x2019;s first exhibit was at the Luz Gallery in 1961. His own works were avowedly conceptual, emphasizing the idea behind his art rather than technique and form. Eventually calling himself a Flux artist, he did collages, drawings, sculptures, and <a href=\"/3/15/2103\">installations</a> using found objects. Also among his and Albano&#x2019;s lasting contributions was the opening up of nonwhite cube sites for art exhibitions and performance spaces, such as the short-lived <a href=\"/3/17/3773\">Shop 6</a> in Cubao, and later in one of the stalls of the Kamalig arcade in Manila. This shifting to alternative venues was also accompanied by the development of emergent art writing platforms."

After the war, <a href=\"/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a> revived his comic strips <b><i><a href=\"/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a> </i></b>and <b><i>Ponyang Halobaybay </i></b>in <b><i><a href=\"/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> </i></b>magazine.<b> <i>Halakhak </i></b>komiks came out right after the war to entertain Filipinos who needed a respite from the hardship. On 27 May 1947, Velasquez and Ramon Roces organized Ace Publications and published <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b>. The komiks featured the works of Velasquez, Manansala, <a href=\"/3/17/3388\">Larry Alcala</a>, Jose Zabala, Damian Velasquez, Jesse Santos, Tony Roullo, E.D. Ramos, Fred Carillo, <a href=\"/3/3/3645\">A.Y. Manalad</a>, and <a href=\"/3/3/3833\">Hugo Yonzon</a>. This was followed by <b><i>Tagalog Klasiks </i></b>in 1949, <b><i>Hiwaga Komiks</i></b> in 1950, <b><i>Espesyal Komiks</i></b> and <b><i>Kenkoy Komiks</i></b> in 1952. It is believed that the comic books brought in by American GIs when they returned to fight the Japanese in 1945 influenced the format adopted by local komiks and hastened its development (Guillermo and Cajipe-Endaya 1994, 108; Roxas and Arevalo<i> </i>1985, 11)."

Miranda and Sons Publishing Corporation, Bulaklak Publications, Soller Press, and Gold Star Publishing House. In the 1960s, Atlas Publishing Co., run by the Roces clan, published many of the most popular novels of the period such as <b><i>Bittersweet</i></b>,<b><i> Maruja</i></b>,<b><i> <strong>Halik</strong> sa Hangin</i></b> (Kiss in the Wind), and <b><i>Alupihang Dagat</i></b> (Sea Centipede). The love-drama-action combination of these novels along with the inclusion of movie columns appealed to a wide readership (Roxas and Arevalo<i> </i>1985, 31). Graphic Arts Service Inc (GASI) was organized on 1 Aug 1962 and run by Damian Velasquez and his brother Tony. GASI published <b><i>Kislap Komiks</i></b>,<b><i> Pioneer Komiks</i></b>,<b><i> <strong>Aliw</strong>an Komiks</i></b>,<b><i> Pinoy Komiks</i></b>,<b><i> <a href=\"/8/67/1486\"><strong>Pinoy Klasiks</strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>Holiday Komiks</i></b>. Their publications featured works by <a href=\"/9/80/5623\">Mars Ravelo</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3477\">Francisco Coching</a>, and Velasquez, among others. In 1963, <a href=\"/9/80/5339\">Pablo S. Gomez</a>, who was formerly an editor of Ace Publications, set up his own company called PSG Publishing House. In 1970, Ravelo organized his own RAR Publishing House. RAR&#x2019;s komiks were different because they were bigger in format than the other komiks being published at the time (Roxas and Arevalo 1985, 25)."

				"value": "After World War II, komiks stories began to veer away from humorous themes. Most of the stories now dealt with romance/fantasy or realistic themes. Realistic themes dealt with real-life heroes and situations but were often laced with elements of romance or fantasy. It was rare for a realist series to be sustained because of the happy ending syndrome characteristic of komiks in circulation during this period (Reyes 1984, 50). The ability of these stories to provide escape from reality through illusionary and fantasy themes while anchoring these on aspects of the real world added to their appeal. The illustrations provided the readers with a visualization of what they could only imagine from reading prose (Reyes 1984, 49). The illustrations in these komiks generally followed two drawing traditions: the realistic and the romantic. The realistic style was usually utilized in stories dealing with contemporary issues and problems in society (Guillermo 1994, 110). Ordinary people were depicted with ordinary qualities such as the characters in Ravelo&#x2019;s <b><i>Roberta</i></b> and in Pablo Gomez and <a href=\"/3/17/3732\">Nestor Redondo</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Batang Bangkusay</i></b> (Guillermo 1994, 110). The romantic style is exemplified by the works of Coching and is characterized by the depiction of handsome heroes and beautiful heroines. The heroes were usually depicted as tall, mestizo or with Malay looks, and with curly hair and rippling muscles (Guillermo 1994, 110). The women, on the other hand, had curvaceous bodies and long curly tresses. In the 1960s, pornographic komiks, called <b>bomba</b> <b>komiks</b>, with graphic and sensual illustrations of the human anatomy proliferated and were published by fly-by-night publishers (Reyes 1984, 50)."

The leading editorial cartoonists of the decade were <a href=\"/3/3/3593\">Esmeraldo &#x201C;EZ&#x201D; Izon</a> of the<b><i> <a href=\"/9/80/5591\"><strong>Philippines Free Press</strong></a></i></b>, <a href=\"/3/17/3568\">Liborio Gatbonton</a> of the <b><i>Manila Chronicle</i></b>, Demetrio Diego of the <b><i>Daily <strong><strong>Mirror</strong></strong></i></b>, and Bert Gallardo of the<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b>. Isaac Tolentino, who was then art director of the<b><i> Philippines Herald</i></b> would substitute for Gallardo in the latter&#x2019;s absence. Among them, Izon had the longest career that spanned the pre- and postwar periods. He started working as editorial cartoonist in the 1930s, doing the page-one editorial cartoon of the <b><i>Philippines Free Press</i></b> with <a href=\"/3/3/3712\">Jose Pereira</a>. The works of these editorial cartoonists harnessed the techniques of distortion in varying degrees. Izon&#x2019;s and Gallardo&#x2019;s works were tamer than Gatbonton&#x2019;s cartoons, which utilized extreme exaggeration. In Izon&#x2019;s works, the diminution and exaggeration of body size to add comic relief was used sparingly. Gallardo&#x2019;s cartoons were more literal and straightforward, and techniques of distortion were rarely used. In contrast, Gatbonton portrayed &#x201C;bad guys&#x201D; with ugly and grossly exaggerated facial features. Diego was very adept in wordplay and produced witty cartoons that combined caricatures with humorous texts. Corky Trinidad joined the<b><i> Philippines Herald </i></b>in 1961. <a href=\"/3/17/3496\">Danilo Dalena</a>&#x2019;s cartoons appeared in the <b><i>Philippines Free Press </i></b>in the late 1960s and in <b><i>Asia-Philippines Leader </i></b>in the early 1970s. Trinidad and Dalena were known for their cartoons providing pointed commentary as these tackled social and political issues."

Modern art served the intellectual and the cultural elite while Mabini art catered to tourists and those who still preferred representational paintings. Both streams of practice satisfied the growing population of fetishistic collectors. Komiks provided the masses with a convenient escape from the harsh realities of life while editorial cartoons gave newspaper readers insights into the period&#x2019;s most controversial headlines. However, the 1960s was also fraught with political tension, and beneath the bustle of artistic activities were the rumblings of discontent and warnings of a looming political crisis. As the 1970s began, a new era rife with political friction was ushered in. <span class>&#xA0;</span> "

Under Marcos, the peso was devaluated upon instructions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which represents the capitalist bloc of countries led by the United States. Peso devaluation, along with cheap labor, assured big profits for foreign investments, thereby attracting multinational corporations which proved disadvantageous to the majority of working masses. Cronyism and corruption in government became rampant. It was estimated that 50 percent of the nation&rsquo;s wealth were in the hands of 5 percent of the population and that this 5 percent consisted of landlords and compradors, agents of foreign monopoly capital (Guillermo 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The atmosphere was rife with political strife and growing unrest largely from a studentry backed and led by militant organizations, among them the Student Cultural Association of the University of the Philippines (SCAUP), founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5700\">Jose Ma. Sison</a> in 1961, and the Kabataang Makabayan (Nationalist Youth) or KM, also founded by Sison in 1964 (Guillermo 2001). Informed by the doctrines of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Tse-tung, these groups were mobilized in the larger context of an international radicalized student movement in the late 1960s and 1970s (Flores 2013, 2). In the Philippines, this movement&rsquo;s foremost ideologue was Sison, who also founded the Communist Party of the Philippines in 1968 and its military arm, the New People&rsquo;s Army (NPA), in 1969. In the same year, Marcos became the first Philippine president to be reelected. In 1973, the National Democratic Front was founded. It was a broad coalition of mass organizations of workers, urban poor, youth, professionals, nuns and priests, who played an expanding role in the revolutionary movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Imposition of Martial Law</b>. Mass actions escalated during Marcos&rsquo;s second term, the most notable of which is known as the First Quarter Storm from January to March of 1970. In 1971, just as Marcos was convening the Constitutional Convention to amend the Constitution according to his own political and economic interests, the oil price hike of two centavos triggered a big rally that turned into a riot. This was accompanied by a weeklong general strike, with transportation coming to a standstill and all schools closed. The streets were filled with indignation rallies and during Marcos&rsquo;s State of the Nation Address, the Kabataang Makabayan hurled a coffin before his face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The ensuing chaos became a justification for the declaration of martial law on 21 Sep 1972 through Proclamation 1081. The declaration enabled Marcos to consolidate his executive and legislative powers, and enabled him to stay in office practically for life, long after the constitutionally mandated eight-year limit. He suspended the Constitution and dissolved Congress in a bid to dismantle what to him was at the root of the nation&rsquo;s problems&mdash;the oligarchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the initial years of martial law, a semblance of economic progress was projected by investing in structures, such as bridges, highways, and seaports, aimed at expanding commerce and trade. New jobs were created in urban and rural areas, but only the very few benefited from such developments. Favors were dispensed to relatives and friends, which created a culture of patronage and indebtedness. The oligarchy that Marcos sought to break was replaced by technocrats and cronies. Amidst uneven modernization and poor economic growth, civil liberties&mdash;the cornerstones of modern democracy&mdash;were violated. Within the frame of what he termed &ldquo;constitutional authoritarianism,&rdquo; Marcos built a legal and military infrastructure consisting of proclamations, executive orders, and counterinsurgency operations carried out in the countryside, in the urban and rural areas, in the form of arrests, illegal detentions to &ldquo;salvagings&rdquo; of suspected NPAs, and massacres of peasants (Guillermo 2001, 14).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The New Society and National Identity</b>. From the eve of the declaration of martial law in the 1970s to the beginning of the regime&rsquo;s decline in the 1980s, there prevailed a climate of fear and a &ldquo;metaphysical unrest&rdquo; (as described by critic Armando Manalo) felt by a restive populace losing faith and confidence in its leaders. Even if propped up by superior force, Marcos&rsquo;s hold on power was besieged with a crisis of legitimacy. He had to convince the populace about the rightness of his rule and his right to that rule. This he strove to accomplish, not by force but a soft approach aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the populace. He built and projected his image as a brilliant, reliable paternal figure who, together with Imelda as mother of the nation, would lead the country toward cultural rebirth. He stated that the Philippines was suffering from an &ldquo;identity crisis&rdquo; and he considered it his mission to lead in restoring racial pride grounded on a common origin predating colonial conquest&mdash;the Great Malayan culture&mdash;and a common destiny, the New Society. Writing in a four-volume tome titled <b><i><strong>Tadhana</strong> </i></b>(Destiny), 1976, he put forward his view of a people who, after participating in &ldquo;man&rsquo;s universal evolution,&rdquo; would go through a &ldquo;particularization process that would over the centuries produce a racial identity&rdquo; that would later develop into a unique and distinct nation. Marching as a New Society, this regenerated nation joins other nations of the free world in the path toward modernity and progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This fusion of rebirth of a long-lost civilization, on the one hand, and aspiration to modernization and development, on the other, was propagated and implemented through an art and culture program that combined the fine arts, architecture, interior design, tourism, convention city building (hotels, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">theaters</a>, coliseums), engineering, urban planning, health, among many others. Carried out in a scale, scope, and magnitude never seen before and since in the Philippines, the official art program was made possible through a controlled media, a tourism that advertised the humane and cosmopolitan face of the Philippines abroad, a national beautification program led by First Lady Imelda Marcos, who was also appointed as minister of human settlements and governor of Metro Manila (Baluyut 2012). She spearheaded the construction of hotels, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/225\">schools</a>, housing projects, and even an efficient transport system&mdash;for example, the Love Bus that linked commercial districts in Cubao and Baclaran via Makati (Herrera 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With this comprehensive cultural program in place, the Marcoses presided over the nation as monumental figures able to unite their &ldquo;children&rdquo; as loving parents with a love story and an ancestry both human and mythical. Ferdinand commissioned and wrote histories to project a dubious wartime heroism, and a genealogy that supposedly molded Marcos&rsquo;s character as a reformer and political genius, deserving of dynastic rule. Marcos and his wife styled themselves as monarchs through portraits showing them bedecked with aristocratic sash, medals, swords, and crowns. Their portraits would portray them in an idealized style, garbed as royalty, and in Imelda&rsquo;s case juxtaposed with Queen Nefertiti of ancient Egypt. They built structures that looked like palaces: Malaca&ntilde;ang ti Amianan in the North and Imelda&rsquo;s house in Tacloban patterned after the Palace of Versailles. They staged events worthy of royalty, such as the lavish wedding of their youngest daughter in Sarrat, Marcos&rsquo;s hometown in Ilocos Norte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Along the Marcos Highway, the <b><i>Marcos Monument</i></b> aka <b><i>Marcos Bust</i></b>, 1981, once sat as a concrete and visible manifestation of this magisterial image. Like a sentinel, it guarded the gateway leading to Baguio, the summer capital. Its form&mdash;colossal in scale&mdash;was a symptom of modernity; its content was archaic. Modern monuments celebrate groups or nations; ancient monuments focus on individuals, and their aristocratic or monarchic statuses and titles. The monument can be seen as a metaphor of Marcos&rsquo;s body and his regime&rsquo;s body politic, with a vein&mdash;the highway that bears his name&mdash;that connects north and south and a face made in his image, simultaneously benevolent and stern. The giant bust soared and surveyed its constituents with an unblinking and totalizing gaze that protected its domain and ensured its integrity as a New Society (Baluyut 1994). In 1989, the structure suffered damages by a blast reportedly done by the New People&rsquo;s Army. It was subsequently destroyed in 2002 by bomb blasts from suspected treasure hunters of the Yamashita treasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Ferdinand and Imelda embellished this imperial image by tracing a mythical ancestry from precolonial society. In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">paintings</a> and even on the doors of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/330\">Malaca&ntilde;an</a>, Marcos and Imelda are depicted as Malakas (Strong) and Maganda (Beautiful), the precolonial versions of the biblical Adam and Eve. Government hospitals, such as the Philippine Heart Center, became venues of mural paintings with themes celebrating folk traditions. At other times, the couple also appropriated the legend of Maria Makiling. For example, at the dedication ceremony of the Philippine High School for the Arts (PHSA) on 7 Apr 1976, the Marcoses &ldquo;performed&rdquo; their commitment to the arts by referencing the myth of the fabled mountain, on which the school was built. It supported a select group of talented young artists, who after going through a rigorous audition, were entitled to a full scholarship and board and lodging (Baluyut 1994).<i> </i>In her speech, Imelda offered PHSA to her husband, the &ldquo;sensitive dreamer&rdquo; who built the school she described as &ldquo;the allegory of our creative passions,&rdquo; a &ldquo;metaphor of our dreams.&rdquo; In his speech, Ferdinand likened Imelda to a sorceress able to turn &ldquo;dreams into reality and reality into a dream&rdquo;&mdash;practically a reincarnation of the generous, graceful, and beautiful goddess. School and mountain became the site of the magical translation of the local myth into a &ldquo;national love story between a mortal (Ferdinand) and a goddess (Imelda), who sought to give birth to a New Society of artists&rdquo; (Baluyut 1994, 50). The old is contemporized, myth crosses over to human reality, a mortal turns into a goddess&mdash;all expressed through the currency of love between superhumans, a love made indistinguishable from a public and national kind of love, love for country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>CCP as Shrine to High Art</b>. As index of progress, refinement, radical experiment, national identity, and love for country, art was circulated through an intricate network of institutions that braided the threads of the premodern and vernacular, the modern and international. National pride was instilled by invoking the premodern through murals, folk festivals, and museums devoted to collecting and displaying ethnographic artifacts and natural specimens. Among these key sites was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum</a>, which was revitalized through constitutional amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the center of this arts and culture program was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, the premier bureaucratic entity through which art acquisition, exhibition making, workshops, grants, and awards were implemented. It was created on 25 Jun 1966 through Executive Order 30 and inaugurated in 1969, the year Marcos was elected to his second term as Philippine president. The modernist-cantilevered building described as a cross between the vernacular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/219\"><i>bahay kubo</i></a> (nipa hut) and art brut minimalism, was designed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>, chief architect of Imelda. It stands like a shrine to High Art on land reclaimed from historic Manila Bay. Like the Marcos monument, this pantheon to art presides over and stands guard at the entrance of the CCP Complex, which consists of satellite structures with varying functions: the Folk Arts Theater, which became the venue of the first Miss Universe Pageant in the Philippines in 1974; the state-of-the-art Philippine International Convention Center, which housed the 1976 IMF&ndash;World Bank Conference; the Tahanang Filipino or Coconut Palace, which was built in anticipation of a papal visit; and the Manila Film Center, which was built to host the Manila International Film Festival to ambitiously rival Cannes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Pageantry, urban planning, design, and architecture were mobilized in the service of the New Society, its lineage and identity. A number of the buildings in the complex, for example, employed concrete blocklike forms indicative of the modern style, while some buildings integrated vernacular elements in conformity with the state&rsquo;s thrust of reviving Filipino traditions. For example, the National Arts Center in the aforementioned PHSA campus in Mount Makiling, designed by Locsin, appropriated the style of vernacular houses like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao </a><i>fale</i>; while the Coconut Palace, designed by Architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2674\">Francisco Ma&ntilde;osa</a>, utilized indigenous building <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials</a> and fashioned the roof to look like a salakot,<i> </i>the native hat worn by farmers to protect them from the elements in the fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Along with architecture, the Design Center of the Philippines (DCP), which was established in 1973, similarly crafted an aesthetic that encompassed the vernacular and the avant-garde. DCP came under the directorship of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\">Arturo Luz</a>, who developed buri, handmade paper, and other local materials for interior design. Located at the rear of the CCP main building, the DCP translated indigenous motifs into contemporary forms applicable to commercial and industrial design, packaging, and marketing of Philippine products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Marcos period propelled a building boom that aspired to build a City of Man, where everything that is true, good, and beautiful reigned supreme. Projecting a cosmopolitan image, the complex edged out a burgeoning urban population, which the City of Man concealed behind whitewashed fences. Imelda was working on a tight schedule while the complex was being constructed, and there were casualties. For example, the Film Center was built at such breakneck speed that midway through the construction, a structure collapsed, trapping hundreds of workers, who were buried under tons of quick-drying cement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amidst the pageantry was resistance and criticism. At the very heart of the regime, a number of artists caused disruptions within the very flagship of Imelda&rsquo;s City of Man. In 1969, during the inauguration of the CCP, the pioneering avant-garde <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\">David Medalla</a> staged a protest with the poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5438\">Jun Lansang</a> and the visual artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3553\">Mars Galang</a>. They unfurled banners that read: &ldquo;We Want a Home, Not a Fascist Temple,&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>A Bas La Mystification</i>&rdquo; (Down with Pretense),<i> </i>&ldquo;Down with Philistines,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Re: Gun, Go Home.&rdquo; The latter text was a pun on the name of then California governor Ronald Reagan who, along with his wife Nancy, was representing American president Richard Nixon for the inauguration. The Medalla-Lansang-Galang trio positioned themselves strategically at a spot along the balconies overlooking the main lobby, where the Marcos and Reagan entourage were expected to pass on their way to the Main Theater (now Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\">Nicanor Abelardo</a>). Alongside these strident banners were placards held aloft by supporters of the regime. Outside the CCP were students who had displayed their own banners protesting the &ldquo;prostitution&rdquo; of the arts, which, as the other banners stated, were poisoning the minds of the hungry and the downtrodden. Barely 200 m away from &ldquo;the fabulous Imelda Center, a ghetto sprawls, where thousands of Filipinos are kept captives by misery and poverty,&rdquo; according to Senator Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino Jr, who delivered the speech on the CCP funds in front of the Senate a few months before the inauguration. It is said that late that evening of the inauguration, a hearse was roaming the streets of Manila in search of Medalla (Flores 2007-10).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another example of a disruptive work is that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3441\">Jose Bautista</a>, a CCP Thirteen Artists awardee in 1972, who submitted a work that appeared in the <b><i>Five Contemporary Sculptors</i></b> exhibition at the Museum of Philippine Art (MOPA). His work drove Imelda to close the exhibition prematurely. Because the exhibition run coincided with an IMF convention, she did not want to expose the delegates to the squalor portrayed in the work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>CCP as Vanguard of the Avant-garde</b>. Through the recommendation of Arturo Luz, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3471\">Roberto Chabet</a>, who exhibited in Luz Gallery in 1961, became the first curator of the CCP Museum, from 1967 to 1970. He was awarded a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, enabling him to travel to the United States and Europe from 1967 to 1968 to observe museum practices abroad before CCP opened. At CCP, he initiated the Thirteen Artists Award, loosely patterned after the influential survey &ldquo;Sixteen Americans&rdquo; at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, and also in honor of the pioneering Thirteen Moderns in Philippine art history. Under his brief tenure, he established CCP as a prime venue for artistic experimentation and collaboration. His work achieved official recognition when he received the Republic Cultural Heritage Award for the visual arts in 1972 and the Gawad CCP para sa Sining in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first recipients of the Thirteen Artists Award in 1970 were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3385\">Raymundo Albano</a> (who succeeded Chabet as CCP Museum curator), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3402\">Angelito Antonio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\">Virgilio Aviado</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3469\">Eduardo Castrillo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3443\">Benedicto Cabrera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3531\">Restituto Embuscado</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3553\">Marciano Galang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3580\">Lamberto Hechanova</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3507\">Jaime de Guzman</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3647\">Noel Manalo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3649\">Ben Maramag</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3744\">Manuel Rodriguez Jr</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3422\">Antonio Austria</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Chabet was by this time exhibiting works that were avowedly conceptual, emphasizing the idea behind his art rather than technique and form. Eventually calling himself a Fluxus artist, he did collages, drawings, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculptures</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installations</a> using found objects. While he was instrumental to CCP&rsquo;s early development and increasingly became an establishment figure, his art never lost its critical bite. For the group exhibition <b><i>Objects</i></b>, held at the CCP in 1973, Chabet tore up a copy of a coffee-table book on Philippine contemporary art and placed it in a trash bin. The work, titled <b><i>Tearing into Pieces</i></b>, was seen as a scandalous critique of the conventions of the art world. In her book <b><i>The Struggle for Philippine Art </i></b>(1974), collector, critic, and founder of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3604\">Purita Kalaw-Ledesma</a> described the work as &ldquo;anti-museum art.&rdquo; After his brief stint as CCP director and curator, he taught at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3811\">University of the Philippines College of Fine Arts</a> (1971-2002), where he mentored a new generation of innovative Filipino artists who have become established painters, sculptors, and multimedia artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under Chabet and later Raymundo Albano, the CCP Museum opened its exhibition programming to works influenced by the Western avant-garde and conceptual tenets, pop art, happenings, environmental <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblages</a>, new realism, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">performance art</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2117\">sound works</a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2117\"> </a>(Gatbonton 1992, in Flores 2009). Experiments in art challenged the commoditization of art within the consumerist system of the art world and its markets at the very heart of the Marcos regime. On the other hand, the Chabet-Albano axis also went beyond the CCP white cube as they opened up nonwhite cube sites for art exhibitions and performance spaces&mdash;furnaces, offices, warehouses, clock towers, shop windows, kitchens, public halls, and hotels, among others. Alternatives to museums were seen, for example, in Gallery 7, Sanctuary, Gallery Indigo, and the short-lived <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3773\">Shop 6</a> in Cubao, and later in one of the stalls of the Kamalig arcade in Manila. This shifting to alternative venues was also accompanied by the development of emergent art writing platforms, including the <b><i>Philippine Art Supplement</i></b> (<b><i>PAS</i></b>) and the <b><i>Review Cultural Forum</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Modern art purveyed by the tight Chabet-Luz axis catered to the intellectual and cultural elite. Albano&rsquo;s curatorial stance was more populist. He initiated projects under the rubrics he termed as &ldquo;developmental art&rdquo; aimed at exposing art to a learning public. He characterized the period 1971-75 as the &ldquo;exposure phase&rdquo; in which advanced art&mdash;experimental in nature&mdash;were displayed in the galleries. Non-art materials, such as sand, junk, iron, lumber, and rocks, were commonly used for the artists&rsquo; development strategies. People were shocked, scared, delighted, and satisfied even though their preconceived notions of art did not agree with what they encountered. &ldquo;Exhibitions,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;should be alive, not church-like, quite high in festive ambience.&rdquo; They should also be thematic, dealing with current visual interests, and should be &ldquo;stimulating, controversial but not scandalous.&rdquo; If Chabet heralded the modern, Albano ushered in the contemporary by investing the modern with the urgency of the now. To be contemporary, he wrote, is to deal with &ldquo;virtually untested, unknown realms of evidences that would lead to further understanding of ourselves&rdquo; (Albano 1981).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Under Albano&rsquo;s directorship, CCP also reached out to regions outside Manila (Baguio, Los Ba&ntilde;os, Cebu) and beyond (Fukuoka, Paris, Southeast Asia), initiated art workshops and outreach programs through community involvement, and published reviews and other essays on art through <b><i>PAS</i></b>.<i> </i>Albano argued that although some experimental forms seemed wholly foreign, he invoked the practice of adorning ephemeral and familiar objects as in fiestas, which shared processes and features with installation art. An early example of installation art is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\">Junyee</a>&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2323\"><strong>Wood Things</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1981, made of <i>kapok </i>or cotton pods, installed on the walls and floor of the CCP&rsquo;s white cube spaces to make these look like crawlers encroaching on the museum space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Art curator Ma. Victoria Herrera, in her assessment of the institutional network of the Marcos years, writes that the new art introduced by the CCP and its satellites &ldquo;may have promoted freedom for the artists but was geared to a limited and specialized public. The wider public then did not have the proper training through education to understand the &lsquo;new&rsquo; art. Yet the modernism promoted by the CCP continued because it had the state&rsquo;s support &hellip; the government was actually playing safe in the arts it was supporting. The MOPA programs supported art that was commercially viable while the CCP Museum promoted artistic expressions that could not be accommodated by the gallery system and the art market&rdquo; (Herrera 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Soon after the collapse of the Marcos administration in 1986, the MOPA was closed and the CCP would be beset with legal, logistic, and fiscal problems&mdash;a testament to the fact that while support to the arts was substantial during the Marcos period, the structures it provided, along with the reclaimed land the CCP stands on, are shaky and vulnerable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>State Patronage and the Art Market</b>. Pioneering avant-garde David Medalla characterized Philippine art during this period as &ldquo;nerve-racking fragmentation&rdquo; (in Flores 2007-10). For artist Raymundo Albano, Philippine art &ldquo;went into the crossroads,&rdquo; speaking from his experience as CCP administrator-director from 1970 to 1985, prior to the declaration of martial law until the eve of the regime&rsquo;s overthrow (Albano 1981). At the crossroads, the early moderns, who were already established artists in the 1960s, became fully entrenched in the canon of Philippine art when they were proclaimed National Artists through the CCP. While the conservatives are represented by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a>, the first National Artist for visual arts who was posthumously awarded in 1972, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>, awarded in 1973, the roster of National Artists for the visual arts are dominated by the moderns. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a>, two of the pioneering members of the Triumvirate of the prewar period, were proclaimed National Artists in 1976 and 1973, respectively. Along with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3685\">Galo Ocampo</a>, they formed a loose group called the Thirteen Moderns, which also included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3686\">H.R. Ocampo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3631\">Diosdado Lorenzo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3521\">Demetrio Diego</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3703\">Jose Pardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3487\">Bonifacio Cristobal</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3464\">Arsenio Capili</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3723\">Ricarte Puruganan</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3640\">Anita Magsaysay-Ho</a>. H.R. Ocampo, proclaimed National Artist in 1991, along with Manansala, who was proclaimed National Artist in 1981, and Legaspi, proclaimed National Artist in 1990, led the formation of the group Neo-Realists, which assumed a more dynamic role in challenging the rural-pastoral style of the Amorsolo School. The group also included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3789\">Romeo Tabuena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3696\">Victor Oteyza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4423\">Ramon Estella</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3752\">Nena Saguil</a>, Edades, and Francisco (Benesa 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Investing heavily in art, the state took the lead in collecting both Western and local art, and institutionalized a protege system that geared young artists toward Western traditions through the Philippine High School for the Arts, a CCP satellite institution located in Mount Makiling. State patronage stimulated the art market. Art became big business. Architects, interior designers, and artists collaborated to their mutual benefit. The moderns, some of whom were later canonized as National Artists, were among those who benefited from this thriving and expanding collectors&rsquo; base. Edades was doing portraits; H.R. Ocampo had shed his social themes of the 1950s and was doing abstracts, such as <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2189\"><strong>Genesis</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1969, later executed as tapestry for the CCP Main Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the CCP as state flagship institution, modernism was circulated through a complicated but tight network of institutions, presided over by an elite clique of tastemakers, leaders, and movers. One of the key figures was Luz, who occupied several roles as artist, curator, and administrator in the Marcos machinery. He worked in tandem with artist and intellectual <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3845\">Fernando Zobel</a>, who profoundly influenced Philippine art appreciation and criticism through his lectures on art at Ateneo de Manila. Ateneo Art Gallery, the first institution of modern art in the Philippines, benefited from Zobel&rsquo;s bequest. Luz exhibited in the gallery, and a 10-year retrospective of his works, curated by Ateneo professor and art critic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3803\">Emmanuel Torres</a>, was held in 1966, the same year Luz received the Republic Heritage Award. Torres likewise wrote a book on his drawings and conceptualized an exhibition of Philippine art, running the length from the 19th-century master <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a> to Luz, underlining his benchmark status. Zobel also had a hand in the establishment of the Ayala Museum, founded on the heels of the Ateneo Art Gallery, Luz Gallery, and Lopez Memorial Museum. Ayala Museum opened on Herran St in 1967 and moved to Makati in 1974 in a building designed by pianist and theater artist Locsin, chief architect of Imelda and the Ayalas. Fernando Zobel&rsquo;s cousin, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3846\">Jaime Zobel de Ayala</a>, the industrialist and business tycoon whose family practically owns the entire financial district of Makati, served as the first executive director and president of the CCP (Flores 2009).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Educated abroad, Zobel and Luz represented a new breed of artists in the 1950s who were influenced by Western art styles and explored &ldquo;painting for painting&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; (Benesa 2015). Later, another painter of the same orientation and spirit also came back from studies abroad&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3445\">Constancio Bernardo</a>, who is described as a &ldquo;disciple of Albers and his optico-geometric colorism&rdquo; (Benesa 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other names that pivoted around Luz and Zobel were to become very visible during the Marcos years, among them <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3738\">Cenon Rivera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3677\">J.Elizalde&nbsp;Navarro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3391\">Federico Aguilar Alcuaz</a> (National Artist, 2009), Joan Edades, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\">Ang Kiukok</a> (National Artist, 2001), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3383\">Jess Ayco</a>, Zny Laygo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3643\">Mauro Malang Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3833\">Hugo Yonzon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3839\">Oscar Zalameda</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3762\">Juvenal Sanso</a>. The majority gravitated this time to a new showplace, according to Benesa: the Luz Gallery, which assumed the functions of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3716\">Philippine Art Gallery (PAG)</a>, which was then starting to lose its vitality and viability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1977, Imelda appointed Luz to head the Museum of Philippine Art, formerly named Contemporary Art Museum of the Philippines, with Raymundo Albano at its helm. The MOPA, which operated through the CCP but was curatorially independent of it, also presented important retrospectives of groundbreaking modernists, many of whom would be proclaimed National Artists. Funded by the CCP, MOPA&rsquo;s function was to promote national art internationally. Under a single director, MOPA and Luz Gallery became intricately connected. While MOPA assumed functions as a museum that acquired and housed a permanent collection, it was also selling art, a function more associated with galleries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from heading the MOPA, Luz was also at the helm of the Metropolitan Museum of Manila or the MET, another Imelda brainchild located a few meters away from the CCP Complex. Having opened in 1977 with loans from the Brooklyn Museum and other galleries in the United States, the MET was also internationalist in orientation. Through the years, it hosted exhibitions by known modern masters, among them Paul Klee and Joseph Beuys, as well as Byzantine icons and Yugoslav <b>naif paintings</b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Modern Art and Imagining the Nation</b>. The Marcoses&rsquo;s aggressive construction of a national identity through art may be traced to the long history of art and theme of nationalism explored by the modernists. In the 1950s, the early modernists portrayed the plight of industrial and urban workers amidst the debate between &ldquo;proletarian art&rdquo; and &ldquo;art for art&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; a debate that was as intense as that between the conservatives and moderns. H.R. Ocampo, a leading figure of the group called the Neo-Realists, painted the social inequalities and the oppression of industrial workers. One of his paintings showed the worker as Christ crucified among chimneys spewing forth pollution; another, <b><i>The Contrast</i></b>, 1940, showed a slum dweller in a hovel against a background of high-rise buildings while partaking of a humble repast. Manansala&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2222\"><strong>Madonna of the Slums</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1950, can also be considered an example of similar Neo-Realist sentiments, while Cesar Legaspi&rsquo;s <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2188\"><strong>Gadgets</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1949, took up the theme of people turning into machines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The issue of national identity bedeviled these early moderns, who developed an idiom that was at once modernist&mdash;that is, distinct from the Amorsolo school&mdash;and &ldquo;Filipino,&rdquo; however the term is defined. One group of artists placed much importance on historical research for defining national identity. An example is Carlos Francisco, the Angono-based artist who also worked in popular forms such as the comics, scenographic paintings for the theater, and costume design for the cinema. His knowledge of Philippine history enriched his murals depicting the history of Manila for the Bulwagang Katipunan (Katipunan Hall) at the Manila City Hall and his series on the history of medicine at the Philippine General Hospital. He made a lasting contribution to Philippine genre in paintings that reflected the life of the peasants and fisherfolk of the Laguna and Rizal lakeshore towns. To this sense of identity, he added the dimension of the people&rsquo;s historical experience from precolonial times, as well as that of the ethnic and folk expressions in the national culture (Guillermo 1997).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Along the same line, another artist, Galo Ocampo, sought to indigenize Philippine religious imagery that had hitherto been of a Caucasian mold, a quality that subtly perpetuated colonial inferiority. His well-known painting that exemplifies the indigenization of religious imagery is the <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2154\"><strong>Brown Madonna</strong></a></strong></i></b>, 1938. He also conveyed his strong reaction to the war through religious images of Christ&rsquo;s passion as interpreted in Philippine folk religious customs, particularly in the image of the flagellant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the mid-1960s, a new generation of young painters matured as heirs to the progressive elements of the postwar period, especially the Neo-Realists. The poet, essayist, and foremost critic of the period, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3444\">Leonidas Benesa</a>, observed that this new generation &ldquo;divides itself into two groupings, but with no real discernible organization or leadership. The first cluster consists of Roberto Chabet, Angelito Antonio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3478\">Florencio Concepcion</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3448\">Charito Bitanga</a>, Antonio Austria, David Aquino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3442\">Norma Belleza</a>, Antonio Chan, William Chua, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3625\">Veronica Lim</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3699\">Leonardo Pacunayen</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3503\">Angelito David</a>, Antonio Hidalgo, Noel Manalo, and Manuel Rodriguez Jr. The second cluster consists of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3627\">Alfredo Liongoren</a>, Kelvin Chung, Marciano Galang, Virgilio Aviado, Ben Maramag, Benedicto Cabrera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3523\">Edgar Doctor</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3654\">Lucio Martinez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3842\">Efren Zaragoza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3615\">Raul Lebajo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3592\">Raul Isidro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3609\">Prudencio Lamarroza</a>, Jaime de Guzman, and Lamberto Hechanova Jr (Benesa 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With Marcos&rsquo;s interest to centralize his power and claim legitimacy through culture, it is therefore not surprising that modern art and its adherents found favor with the state. The interest in art as the symbol of a homogenous nation was a direction effectively sustained in other republics in Asia, post-World War II. In the hands of the dictatorship, this meant on the one hand a strong cultural policy aligned with economic development, and the suppression of dissident voices in the other. The fact that the idea of a nation can have permutations in terms of social class, ethnicity, and gender will find adherents in artists who fought martial law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"position:relative\"><span style=\"top:1.0pt\"><a id=\"visual\" name=\"visual\"></a></span></span></span><strong>The Visual Arts during Martial Law</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The issue of nation, national identity, and nationalism were major areas of concern that were interpreted in several ways, at times intersecting and oftentimes colliding. These concepts are politically diffuse, and they took many forms (Guillermo 1997). Nationalism was conceptualized and mobilized in this period by Marcos&rsquo;s repressive regime to win popular consent and legitimization. Evoking tradition and race, Marcos&rsquo;s nationalism was articulated as apolitical, totalizing, and homogenizing based on an unchanging essence of what it is to be Filipino. In opposition, there is the nationalism of the many unknown revolutionary artists, which is anti-imperialist and anti-neocolonial, and articulated within the class struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the period immediately preceding martial law (1965-69), three figures defined nationalism in the context of protest. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\">Danilo Dalena</a>, a top political cartoonist, satirized public figures led by Marcos and his cronies and the ubiquitous figure of Uncle Sam. Painter and student activist Jaime de Guzman worked on the theme of history, rather than contemporary reality, drawing inspiration from the 19th century, which for him was a heroic age of nationalism and revolution that reverberated into the present struggle. Printmaker and painter Benedicto Cabrera or BenCab similarly focused on the theme of national identity and anticolonial struggle, but in mediums and techniques that explored new expressive devices such as montage, multiple framing, and serial repetition. His Larawan series<b><i> </i></b>(ongoing from 1972) exemplifies these explorations. It linked the precolonial past and the postcolonial present through photographs. From a wide range of portraits of Filipino types and scenes&mdash;from mestiza women, petty politicians, soldiers marching, and a public execution&mdash;he created &ldquo;montages, juxtaposing, cropping, multiplying and reversing them like playing cards in order to elicit meanings&rdquo; (Guillermo in Flores 2013). The way he juxtaposed these scenes and characters illustrates a keen awareness of historical contradictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalena also painted canvases depicting faceless mobs as the dreary audience and decadent participants at horse races, jai alai, and sweepstakes betting lines, and religious processions. Dalena and de Guzman were expressionist, painterly, and dramatic, aiming for the epic sweep. Other expressionists included Ang Kiukok, whose apocalyptic landscapes mirrored the conflict and despair of the times, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3693\">Onib Olmedo</a>, who explored the lower depths in haunting images of the dispossessed. Olmedo and Dalena came out strongly with faces imaged from the anonymous crowd. Ang, on the other hand, initially put off beholders with his distorted and angular crucifixions and his anguished skeletal figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalena, de Guzman, and BenCab were highly influential in shaping the course of <b>protest art</b>, although these influences on younger artists were not immediately apparent and recognized. Among those who were inspired by the historical allegories of de Guzman and BenCab were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3468\">Orlando Castillo</a>, former president of the Printmakers Association of the Philippines, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3577\">Renato Habulan</a>. Both artists draw on 19th-century figures, both real and fictional. Sisa, the haunting fictional figure in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\">Rizal&rsquo;s novel</a>, appears in the work of Habulan, and Bonifacio-like figures are motifs in Castillo&rsquo;s work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Dalena, Ang, and Olmedo represented a new generation who were active amidst the bustling art scene resulting from the state&rsquo;s patronage of the art under martial law. Other notable names are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3691\">Romulo Olazo</a>, Antonio Austria, Angelito Antonio, Lino Severino, Mauro Malang Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3704\">Mario Parial</a>, Angelito David, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3726\">Rodolfo Ragodon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3450\">Jose Blanco</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3663\">Sofronio Y. Mendoza</a>, among others. A number of art trends were also becoming discernible, such as the &ldquo;vanishing scene&rdquo; paintings, which sought to portray images of social transition, relics and vestiges of an earlier time, whether from the 19th century or the early American period (Guillermo 1997). This is seen in the tonal paintings of a more documentary and literal quality, such as those by Lino Severino who painted old houses in decay, or in the ink drawings of Antonio Doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Folk genre of Botong Francisco&rsquo;s tradition was carried on by lakeshore artists of Angono, Tanay, and Binangonan. These included painters such as Jose Blanco, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3601\">Salvador Juban</a>, Nemesio Miranda, and Vicente Reyes. There was likewise a trend of schooled artists consciously developing a &ldquo;<b>folk-naive</b>&rdquo; quality, portraying native subjects in a style derived from folk and children&rsquo;s art. Among these were Antonio Austria, and to some extent Mario Parial (Guillermo 1997). Another subgroup is more popularly known as the Dimasalang Group, which promoted Impressionist styles. Among the group members were Sofronio Mendoza, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3488\">Emilio Aguilar Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3554\">Romulo Galicano</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3510\">Ibarra dela Rosa</a> (Flores 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\">Brenda Fajardo</a>, educator, art administrator, community organizer, visual and theater artist, is largely identified with the indigenized tarot card, within which she frames historical and social events and issues. On the other hand, Norma Belleza is known for her genre paintings of ordinary people, rendered in her distinctive style combining the folk characteristics of highly saturated colors and the cubist rendering of stocky and hard-edged figures. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3626\">Araceli Limcaco-Dans</a>&rsquo;s paintings reference needlework in her meticulously rendered Calado<i> </i>(heavy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2100\">embroidery</a>) series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\"><strong>Printmaking</strong></a> in the Philippines became recognized as a contemporary art medium in the 1960s onward even if at one juncture was thought of as &ldquo;dead.&rdquo; This rejuvenation largely came through the efforts of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3702\">Rod Paras-Perez</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3745\">Manuel Rodriguez Sr</a>. Rodriguez taught and formed departments of printmaking in the University of Santo Tomas and Philippine Women&rsquo;s University (PWU), and brought with him the knowledge on printmaking he learned from studies in the United States. He opened the Contemporary Art Gallery for graphic artists, where he sold his students&rsquo; works. He helped organize the Philippine Association of Printmakers. The majority of the first young printmakers were taught by Rodriguez either in PWU or in his workshops at his gallery. Among these are Virgilio Aviado, Lucio Martinez, Lamberto Hechanova, Restituto Embuscado, Mario Parial, Adiel Arevalo, Petite Calaguas, Emet Valente, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3141\">Nonon Padilla</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>as well as Rodriguez&rsquo;s own sons Manuel Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3746\">Marcelino</a>, and Ray Rodriguez. The Rodriguez workshops also attracted a number of women, whose contributions resonate till the present. They were Brenda Fajardo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3462\">Imelda Cajipe-Endaya</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3569\">Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3424\">Ivi Avellana-Cosio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3724\">Nelfa Querubin</a>, among others. Printmaking changed the course of Rodriguez&rsquo;s career, and his influence was felt mostly between the 1950s and the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In sculpture, it was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>, a student of Tolentino, who posed the modernist challenge to the Amorsolo and Tolentino schools through a variety of sculptural mediums&mdash;wood, stone, and metal&mdash;and styles ranging from figurative to abstract. Abueva has also developed a functional side to his sculpture in hand-carved benches, imaginative chairs, room dividers, and even a chariot. His works from the 1970s to the 1980s were commissioned sculptures for public spaces installed in the business district of Makati City. In 1976, he was declared National Artist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the early 1970s, Eduardo Castrillo emerged as a major sculptor, working in metal and a strong figurative style. His memorial park sculptures <b><i>Pieta </i></b>and <b><i>The Last Supper </i></b>are large-scale, featuring ungainly figures that evoke a sense of brokenness and rupture. He also produced sculptures of social themes, exemplified in metal reliefs such as the mural-size <b><i>Boat Refugees</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3767\">Solomon Saprid</a> is similarly anticlassical. His <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2309\"><strong>Tikbalang</strong></a></strong></i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1971, a half-man, half-horse image based on a Filipino folk belief in malevolent spirits, and his mother-and-child sculptures are dynamic, expressionistic, produced through a technique that welds strips of metal with a blowtorch resulting in an uneven and jagged surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At this time, Arturo Luz and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3486\">Allan Cosio</a> were doing works in basic geometric shapes in mediums of wood and stone, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3440\">Glenn Bautista</a> did occasional sculptures in organic shapes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\">Abdulmari Imao</a>, proclaimed National Artist in 2006, distinguished himself as a contemporary Muslim sculptor drawing inspiration from the okir tradition and from Islamic calligraphy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1983, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3629\">Julie Lluch</a> produced a series of cacti, hearts, butts, and other organic shapes. Her acclaimed works have a highly personal approach and feminist signification. Her portraits in the 1980s were about women&rsquo;s predicaments as mothers and wives exemplified in <b><i>Philippine Gothic II </i></b>and <b><i>Picasso y Yo</i></b>.<b><i> </i></b>Another important work is that of a full-length female nude appraising herself before a mirror signifying women&rsquo;s awakening consciousness of herself as an independent entity. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3411\">Agnes Arellano</a> produced life-size sculptures aiming to provoke an immediate response from viewers. One of her works from the 1980s depicted a couple eternally cast, locked in an embrace that recalls the way her parents were found after the fire that burned down their home. From the ashes, Arellano built <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3720\">Pinaglabanan Galleries</a>, which was a haven for experimental art shows outside the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3482\">Rey Paz Contreras</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Noise Barrage </i></b>alluded to a popular form of protest during the transition period between Marcos and Aquino. This assemblage consisted of a standing sculpture with a xylophone-like arrangement of wooden bars on the lower level and hangings of an ethnic mask, an animal skull, and antique rifle and other symbols drawn from cultural minorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Sculptors worked in a variety of materials and techniques. J. Elizalde Navarro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3742\">Renato Rocha</a>, Angelito Baldemor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3410\">Ros Arcilla</a>, and Contreras worked in wood; Imao, Castrillo, Saprid, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3807\">Virginia Ty-Navarro</a> in metal casting; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3664\">Conrado Mercado</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3544\">Honrado Fernandez</a> used metal plates and rods; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\">Jose Tence Ruiz</a>, Edgar Doctor, J. Elizalde Navarro, and Lamberto Hechanova made mixed media assemblages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3650\">Ildefonso Marcelo</a> became famous for using adobe; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3718\">Impy Pilapil</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3694\">Ramon Orlina</a> for glass; Lluch and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3474\">Charlie Co</a> for clay; Arellano, Peter de Guzman, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3729\">Dan Raralio</a> for resin and plaster of paris. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3818\">Francisco Verano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3541\">Roberto Feleo</a> invented a sculptural medium made of fine wood shavings, acrylic polymer, and fiberglass. From his immediate environment in Los Ba&ntilde;os, Junyee (Luis Yee Jr) sourced organic materials such as banana pulp, coconut shells, dried kapok pods, coconut twigs, and acacia bark, which he twined together to form mobiles and installations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artists who enjoyed Imelda&rsquo;s patronage, such as Francisco and Jose Blanco, fit into the regime&rsquo;s search for a premodern origin through the folk traditions portrayed in the artists&rsquo; landscape and genre paintings. At the same time, the non-objective art of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\">Jose Joya</a>, and the geometric abstractions of Arturo Luz, lent this nativist identity a cosmopolitan and international character. Non-objective art in the tradition of the New York School of Abstract Expressionism would be embodied in the canvases of Jose Joya and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3380\">Lee Aguinaldo</a>. Other artists who continued to work in the non-objective mode were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3611\">Lao Lianben</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3458\">Benjie Cabangis</a>, Allan Cosio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3560\">Danilo Garcia</a>, Romulo Olazo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3387\">August Albor</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3836\">Phyllis Zaballero</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the few women who explored the idiom of non-objective abstraction largely identified with Bernardo, Luz, and Joya was Nena Saguil, who lived in Paris since 1956 until her death in 1994. Going through a brief transition from figurative paintings into cubism in her early works in Paris, she largely used a network of lines to produce different geometric forms and shapes of textured canvases (Datuin 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the crossroads of Philippine Art, a plurality of ideas and expressions clashed, cohered, and collided in an infinity of layers impossible to plot in a tidy and linear mode. Modern art catered to the intellectual and cultural elite, while another type of art&mdash;from Mabini art to those by National Artists&mdash;catered to tourists and a vibrant collectors&rsquo; base. Popular forms, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">comics</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1355\">soap operas</a>, became a refuge and escape for the majority; developmental art at the Shrine to High Art that was the CCP sought to educate, at times shocking as the art of the new. Some of those who enjoyed the support of the Marcos establishment&mdash;some emerging from the Philippine High School for the Arts, others from the CCP and its satellites, and other gatekeeper institutions&mdash;became its fiercest critics, but also its innovators who gave the most productive contributions to the art that was to follow after the Marcos years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Protest and Revolutionary Art</b>. The art historian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3575\">Alice Guillermo</a> (2001) coined the term &ldquo;<b>social realism</b>&rdquo; in the late 1980s to define the work of Kaisahan and artists associated with them. She links Philippine social realism with the socialist and realist movement in art espoused by artists like Gustave Courbet in the context of the intense republican struggles of 19th-century France. Philippine social realism, she writes, is similarly linked to the liberation movements in the Third World, but developed its own character arising out of its particular historical and cultural specificities. Social realism in the Philippines shares with its global counteparts its political orientation and the belief in art as an agent of social change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Heir to the Neo-Realist tradition, the social realists of the 1970s grew out of a movement backed by militant organizations, among them the SCAUP and KM. When KM started to mobilize artists in their ranks, a group started to coalesce as early as 1969, and was officially formed in 1971. Called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3674\">Nagkakaisang Progresibong Artista at Arkitekto (United Progressive Artists and Architects) or NPAA</a>, the group produced art that aimed for greater visual impact and wider accessibility through popular forms such as posters, comics, and cartoons for people&rsquo;s publications. This group set the precedent for a collective formed in 1976&mdash;Kaisahan (Solidarity), whose members initially included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3764\">Pablo &ldquo;Adi&rdquo; Baens Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3543\">Edgar Talusan Fernandez</a>, Renato Habulan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3519\">Antipas &ldquo;Biboy&rdquo; Delotavo</a>, Papo de Asis, Albert Jimenez, and Jose Cuaresma. They were later joined by Al Manrique, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3524\">Neil Doloricon</a>, Jose Tence Ruiz, Orlando Castillo, Charles Funk, and the late graphic artist and photographer Vin Toledo who, with printmaker Orlando Castillo, served as political officer and ideologue. This group, according to Guillermo, was the first to be known as &ldquo;social realist.&rdquo; The members of the group who trained as painters&mdash;Castillo, Baens Santos, Habulan, and Fernandez&mdash;were already actively exhibiting before the formation of Kaisahan in 1976. They had minimal representation in Marcos&rsquo;s cultural program and in fact was largely excluded from the CCP radar. The Kaisahan, after the NPAA, was the first cohesive organization of political artists who clearly affirmed their principles in a manifesto and subsequent texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the height of martial law (1979) toward the beginning of the Marcos regime&rsquo;s end (1983), the Kaisahan artists became very active. This is indicated by their artistic contributions that were later called <b>protest</b> and <b>revolutionary art</b>, a term that Guillermo subsequently used to accommodate a wider array of expressions and themes critical of the system, as these flourished during and even beyond the period. Using a variety of styles and media, the artists wove into the fabric of protest and revolutionary art a wide range of themes that captured the incongruities of the New Society. The themes are as follows: the Philippine Revolution of 1896, images of the Filipino, the three basic evils of society (feudalism, bureaucrat capitalism, and imperialism) and the struggles against these, the struggle of indigenous Filipinos, militarization and human rights violations, the threat to ecological balance, religious themes and theology of liberation, the plight of Filipino migrant workers, feminist themes, media censorship, the growth of the mass movement, and the vision of a new order (Guillermo 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Delotavo&rsquo;s <b><i>Itak sa Puso ni Mang Juan </i></b>(Knife in Juan&rsquo;s Heart), 1978, portrays a stooped figure against an almost flat and stifling surface, where several contending forces are painted in a zone of unequal power relations: multinationals, on the one hand, and the exploited workers, on the other. A ubiquitous product of American capitalism overwhelms its consumers who are at the same time also its labor force. Advertising is so powerful and yet so oppressive that it is about to cut into human flesh through the serif of the letter &ldquo;C&rdquo; of the Coca-Cola logo, stopping short of piercing the heart, which continues to beat, albeit with disquietude and foreboding, seemingly warning of a coming storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Habulan is another artist who made incisive portraits of workers and peasants. In <b><i>Dulo&rsquo;t Dulo </i></b>(Polarities), 1979, he brought out the great disparity existing between different social classes, in a montage of portraits consisting of images of the <i>sakada</i> (seasonal plantation workers) and the <i>ilustrado </i>(educated)<i> </i>landlords. His most outstanding work is the large-scale painting <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2211\"><strong>Kagampan</strong></a></strong> </i></b>(Fullness of Time) where several scores of workers and peasants carrying their working tools were massed together in several ascending rows occupying almost the entire visual field, as they confront the viewer in a show of strength and solidarity, their expressions and stances hinting at a smoldering anger and implying a challenge to the established order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The social realists also introduced innovations and experimentations in their art, such as the use of wooden cutouts of peasants and workers, bark for painting, and photographic techniques using acrylic on canvas, as done by Edgar Talusan Fernandez, who also produced the first three-dimensional examples of protest art. <b><i>Kinupot </i></b>(Smothered)<b><i> </i></b>wrapped a group of figures in white cloth, with outlines of their hands and feet shown struggling against the taut sheet, conveying political repression. Doloricon used collage and wood panel montage; Tence Ruiz produced an assemblage of found objects and machine parts in his Jeepney series and box art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paris-based Ofelia Gelvezon-Tequi, well-known for her prints, also uses silk, acrylic, and mixed media. From the Marcos years to the post-Aquino assassination years, she developed elegant social critiques by fusing religious, medieval, pop, contemporary, and folk images in her works. <b><i>Self Images I</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1980, shows the Filipina in various guises as rural lass, hopeful professional graduate, Miss Body Beautiful, and peasant street sweeper&mdash;all rolled up and framed in a slot machine. <b><i><strong>Retablo</strong> </i></b>(Altarpiece),<b><i> </i></b>1982, unmasks the mythos of power disguised as holiness with shadowy military figures superimposed upon an altar of saints configured in a pinball machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Imelda Cajipe-Endaya is well-known for her large-scale collages made of sawali (woven-bamboo walls), crocheted curtains, denim pants, and brightly colored oilcloth. In these works, she painted images of women and their plight, starting from her own experience as a housewife. This proceeded from feminist impulse that matured into conscious advocacy after 1983, when she was among those who marched on the streets, founded and joined women&rsquo;s groups, and became more directly social realist in her art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3639\">Lani Maestro</a>&rsquo;s major works in the 1980s also dealt with the theme of political violence paying tribute to victims whose lives were lost to political killings, torture, and disappearances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">There were artists who drew vitality from actual interaction with people in the countryside and guerrilla zones in the heart of the armed struggle. Castillo&rsquo;s paintings of his sojourn in the Cordilleras and Samar in early 1980 were never exhibited in a gallery. These depict situational images of NPA guerrillas in the field and in educational sessions, village doctors tending to the sick, and scenes of childbirth and death. Another social realist, Al Manrique presented a number of works after coming back from Davao in 1982. A 1983 painting, <b><i>Ang Mabuhay sa Takot </i></b>(To Live in Fear), alludes to hamleting or the relocation of peasants into instant villages so that the military could observe them more closely and isolate them from the guerrillas operating in their villages.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The martial law period also saw an unprecedented proliferation of popular art forms aimed at reaching out to non-museum audiences. Comics, murals, posters, drawings and illustrations for books, papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2099\">effigies</a>, prints in etching, aquatint or rubbercut, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, <b>peryodikits</b> (instant paintings on walls), masks, T-shirt printing, even pendants and greeting cards, among many others, were vehicles for political messages. Painters and graphic artists linked up with photographers to work on posters and other visual arts projects, especially during mass demonstrations and rallies. They also linked up with theater artists and musicians, thereby giving multimedia performances in auditoriums, on improvised stages, and on the streets, with visual artists exploring new roles in the other arts (Guillermo 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While many continued to do paintings on oil and canvas, artists produced a number of popular forms. Tence Ruiz, Doloricon, Fernandez, and Jess Abrera became regular editorial cartoonists in newspapers and publications. Underground publications were enhanced with visual forms, such as <b><i>Dare to Struggle / Dare to Win</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>three issues of which appeared from 1972 to 1973 addressed to cultural workers. The underground national cultural magazine <b><i>Ulos </i></b>had illustrations both by full-time underground movement artists and well-known social realists. Regional newspapers also contained illustrations for editorials, news features, and articles. Among these were <b><i>Dangadang</i></b> (Northwestern Luzon), <b><i>Taliba ng Bayan</i></b> (Manila-Rizal), <b><i>Larab </i></b>(Eastern Visayas), <b><i>Baringkuas </i></b>(Northeastern Luzon), and <b><i>Pulang Silangan</i></b> (East Central Luzon). Illustrations were also made for education manuals used in the cultural revolution, an example of which is <b><i>Maikling Kurso tungkol sa Kilusang Magsasaka</i></b> (Short Course on the Peasant Movement) published by the Komisyon sa Edukasyon at Propaganda (Education and Propaganda Commission) in Sep 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Revolutionary artists gained a real firsthand knowledge of Philippine society and its conditions. Not satisfied with producing artworks, they shared their expertise in numerous workshops, conferences, art caravans, and tours that enabled greater circulation of artists all over the country. Soon, protest and revolutionary art began to flourish in the regions. Political organizations were formed in Davao and Bacolod. Because of these exchanges and greater mobility, a sense of a national identity and people&rsquo;s culture took shape with substance and meaning that challenged Marcos&rsquo;s vision of nation and national identity under the New Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Regional artists&rsquo; groups of various political persuasions were formed outside Manila. In Bacolod, one of the first artists&rsquo; groups was founded in 1980, the Pamilya Pintura. Its members included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3394\">Nunelucio Alvarado</a>, Charlie Co, Perry Argel, Jojo Regollo, Danny Dojillo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3747\">Norberto &ldquo;Peewee&rdquo; Roldan</a>, Norberto Tarroja, Dennis Ascalon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3705\">Diokno Pasilan</a>, and Boy Garovillo. By 1986, a number of artists from this group formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3449\">Black Artists in Asia (BAA)</a>, a more radical organization. Members of this later group included Alvarado, Roldan, Co, Ascalon, and Lourdes Villanueva. The BAA spearheaded the Visayan Island Visual Art Exhibition and Conference and participated in the Baguio Arts Festival. Also in the 1980s in Mindanao, Tex Salvador founded the Artists Association of South Cotabato; the late Mike Martinez spearheaded the founding of the Art Association of Zamboanga (Datuin 1998).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was also in the 1980s when women artists&rsquo; groups were established, such as Katipunan ng mga Kababaihan para sa Kalayaan (Organization of Women for Freedom or Kalayaan) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3605\">Kababaihan sa Sining at Bagong Sibol na Kamalayan (Women in Art and Emerging Consciousness or Kasibulan)</a>. The founding of Kasibulan and Kalayaan coincided with the founding of other groups that address a wide range of concerns&mdash;ranging from culture to political participation and health, establishment of a government women&rsquo;s desk at the CCP, and the effecting of structural change through revolution. They include the revolutionary group Malayang Kilusan ng Bagong Kababaihan (Free Movement of New Women or Makibaka), established shortly before Marcos declared martial law; the militant coalition Gabriela; the Council for Primary Health; the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3715\">Philippine Art Educators Association</a>; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a> Women&rsquo;s Desk. Also among the important women&rsquo;s groups to come out was Women in Media Now or WOMEN, formed in 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The assassination of Marcos&rsquo;s principal opponent Ninoy Aquino on 21 Aug 1983 brought the country to another crossroads, with the political situation becoming extremely volatile. There was heightened militancy not only from the studentry and mass organizations but also from the upper and middle classes. New protest venues, like the elite enclave of Makati, were activated and became littered with yellow banners and confetti. At the same time, arrests and detentions, tortures and disappearances increased significantly. These conditions were reflected in paintings of suffering, such as in Baens Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Malumbay si Ina </i></b>(Mother Weeps) and Doloricon&rsquo;s <b><i>Hinagpis </i></b>(Lamentation), both painted in 1983. The former shows a huge upside-down face of a mother weeping from the heavens; the latter is a montage panel juxtaposing images of hunger and poverty with that of a worker slain during a strike. In 1984, political detainees Fr Edicio dela Torre, Alan Jazmines, Noel Etabag, and Manuel Mario Guzman held a group show at Sining Kamalig showing nightmarish images of solitary confinement, torture, and their intense psychological effects along with the themes of death and resurrection and the hope for freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A wide range of symbols and rallying figures emerged during this period of the regime&rsquo;s decline. One of the most notable is the <b><i>Justice for Aquino, Justice for All</i></b> mural, which bore the faces of martyrs Macli-ing Dulag, Dr Bobby de la Paz, Edgar Jopson, Dr Johnny Escandor, and Ninoy Aquino. Young artist Manuel Gutierrez, who was himself slain later in a military encounter, produced a mural <b><i>Fight for the People&rsquo;s Right to Know, Fight for Press Freedom</i></b>, 1986. Also in homage to the martyrs, Baens Santos painted <b><i>Alay sa Bagong <strong>Bayani</strong> </i></b>(Offering to the New Hero) in 1984 (Guillermo 2001).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Themes related to hope, regeneration, and renewal were also evident in some artists&rsquo; works, such as Baens Santos&rsquo;s <b><i>Bagong Pinay </i></b>(New Filipina),<b><i> </i></b>Fernandez&rsquo;s <b><i>Arko ng Pagkakaisa </i></b>(Arch of Unity), which showed various classes and sectors joining together to mourn a slain hero draped with a Philippine flag, symbolizing all those who were martyred in the struggle. Fernandez&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2195\"><b><i>Hanap Ay Laya</i></b></a> (Freedom Is What We Want), 1984, expressed the people&rsquo;s aspiration for freedom and sovereignty through a mother-and-child figure draped in the colors of the Philippine flag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Clenched fists symbolizing militancy and defiance were transformed into hands creating an eloquent language of production and struggle in Manrique&rsquo;s Hand series.<b><i> </i></b>Fernandez&rsquo;s painting of rows of feet of people from all classes marching beside a yellow-draped figure symbolized the unity of the rich and the poor around a common cause. Ninoy&rsquo;s assassination became the subject of numerous paintings and even became a theme of one Metrobank art competition. Birds&mdash;live and as subject matter&mdash;along with confetti strips cut from telephone yellow pages, also became popular as symbols of freedom, unity, and aspirations. Colors also acquired different meanings: red symbolized the national democratic organizations; yellow was for moderate urban, middle-class groups supportive of Corazon &ldquo;Cory&rdquo; Aquino&rsquo;s candidacy in the 1986 presidential snap elections and subsequent EDSA Revolt. The bifurcation between red and yellow forces is mirrored in spatial terms: Ugarte Field for the Makati elite and Plaza Miranda for the masses. The symbolic and spatial divisions reveal that while, on the surface, all classes and political persuasions were united in a common anti-Marcos cause, on a deeper level the wedge between the classes are so deep-seated. The radical potential of so-called people&rsquo;s power was neutralized by middle-class and elite alternatives, who galvanized themselves as a less radical alternative to the militant mass and national democratic movement. Progressive personalities were gradually replaced by what Guillermo describes as &ldquo;right-wing elements,&rdquo; such as those identified with ultraconservative religious groups and individuals formerly in the military. An image that stood out in this period was that of a poster based on the photograph of a vigilante, Norberto Manero Jr, proudly displaying his grisly trophy of a human head, that of a progressive Italian priest Tulio Favali. In 1985, Manero&rsquo;s group murdered Favali in a gruesome manner, which underlined the inhumane conditions of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Marcos was deposed in 1986 and was succeeded by a member of two of the most enduring political dynasties in the Philippines&mdash;the Cojuangcos and Aquinos, a formation Marcos had sought to break. Marcos, however, became a new oligarch, along with his favored technocrats and cronies. The beginning of the end came after the assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino Jr. Aquino&rsquo;s wife, Corazon Cojuangco Aquino, became the first president to assume office after 20 years of what is often referred to as the Marcoses&rsquo; conjugal dictatorship (Guillermo 2001, 12-13).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Political art initially became a platform of celebration of the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship. The CCP, a contested site since its inception, opened up to a democratic space that enabled exhibits like <b><i>Piglas</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which featured the protest art of those previously excluded in its programming. Amidst the rejoicing, the social realists continued to be a cynical and critical voice in what they perceived to be a continuation of elite and bourgeoisie political leadership. In Baens Santos&rsquo;s painting <b><i>Congratulations to the Liberal Democrats</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>1985, Cory is shown jumping with glee while the new elites applaud below. When it was becoming clear that the Cory administration was as vulnerable to corruption and as beholden to the United States as its predecessor, the euphoria waned; celebratory images dwindled and were replaced by images of disillusionment and even grimmer realities. The democratic space shrank in no time and was replaced by resumption of an even more vigorous military campaign in the countryside with the Aquino administration&rsquo;s policy of &ldquo;total war&rdquo; against politicized peasant masses, coupled with her advocacy of vigilante groups from fanatic and criminal elements terrorizing rural communities. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Flaudette May Datuin</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"related\" name=\"related\"></a>Related Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\" target=\"_self\">Assemblage</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\" target=\"_self\">Painting and Related Forms</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\" target=\"_self\">Sculpture</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"SourceLogobold\" style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"sources\" name=\"sources\"></a>Sources</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Albano, Raymundo. 1981. &ldquo;Developmental Art in the Philippines.&rdquo; Philippine Art Supplement 2, no. 4.

				"value": "When Ferdinand Marcos began his first term as president of the Philippines in 1965, there was heightened political awareness that raised issues of national importance: the effect on the economy of the multinational corporations, the United States (US) military bases, corruption in government, and gross social inequalities. Under Marcos, the peso was devaluated upon instructions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which represents the capitalist bloc of countries led by the United States. Peso devaluation, along with cheap labor, assured big profits for foreign investments, thereby attracting multinational corporations which proved disadvantageous to the majority of working masses. Cronyism and corruption in government became rampant. It was estimated that 50 percent of the nation&#x2019;s wealth were in the hands of 5 percent of the population and that this 5 percent consisted of landlords and compradors, agents of foreign monopoly capital (Guillermo 2001)."

Sison</a> in 1961, and the Kabataang Makabayan (Nationalist Youth) or KM, also founded by Sison in 1964 (Guillermo 2001). Informed by the doctrines of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Tse-tung, these groups were mobilized in the larger context of an international radicalized student movement in the late 1960s and 1970s (Flores 2013, 2). In the Philippines, this movement&#x2019;s foremost ideologue was Sison, who also founded the Communist Party of the Philippines in 1968 and its military arm, the New People&#x2019;s Army (NPA), in 1969. In the same year, Marcos became the first Philippine president to be reelected. In 1973, the National Democratic Front was founded. It was a broad coalition of mass organizations of workers, urban poor, youth, professionals, nuns and priests, who played an expanding role in the revolutionary movement."

In 1971, just as Marcos was convening the Constitutional Convention to amend the Constitution according to his own political and economic interests, the oil price hike of two centavos triggered a big rally that turned into a riot. This was accompanied by a weeklong general strike, with transportation coming to a standstill and all schools closed. The streets were filled with indignation rallies and during Marcos&#x2019;s State of the Nation Address, the Kabataang Makabayan hurled a coffin before his face."

				"value": "The ensuing chaos became a justification for the declaration of martial law on 21 Sep 1972 through Proclamation 1081. The declaration enabled Marcos to consolidate his executive and legislative powers, and enabled him to stay in office practically for life, long after the constitutionally mandated eight-year limit. He suspended the Constitution and dissolved Congress in a bid to dismantle what to him was at the root of the nation&#x2019;s problems&#x2014;the oligarchy."

New jobs were created in urban and rural areas, but only the very few benefited from such developments. Favors were dispensed to relatives and friends, which created a culture of patronage and indebtedness. The oligarchy that Marcos sought to break was replaced by technocrats and cronies. Amidst uneven modernization and poor economic growth, civil liberties&#x2014;the cornerstones of modern democracy&#x2014;were violated. Within the frame of what he termed &#x201C;constitutional authoritarianism,&#x201D; Marcos built a legal and military infrastructure consisting of proclamations, executive orders, and counterinsurgency operations carried out in the countryside, in the urban and rural areas, in the form of arrests, illegal detentions to &#x201C;salvagings&#x201D; of suspected NPAs, and massacres of peasants (Guillermo 2001, 14)."

				"value": "<b>The New Society and National Identity</b>. From the eve of the declaration of martial law in the 1970s to the beginning of the regime&#x2019;s decline in the 1980s, there prevailed a climate of fear and a &#x201C;metaphysical unrest&#x201D; (as described by critic Armando Manalo) felt by a restive populace losing faith and confidence in its leaders. Even if propped up by superior force, Marcos&#x2019;s hold on power was besieged with a crisis of legitimacy. He had to convince the populace about the rightness of his rule and his right to that rule. This he strove to accomplish, not by force but a soft approach aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the populace. He built and projected his image as a brilliant, reliable paternal figure who, together with Imelda as mother of the nation, would lead the country toward cultural rebirth. He stated that the Philippines was suffering from an &#x201C;identity crisis&#x201D; and he considered it his mission to lead in restoring racial pride grounded on a common origin predating colonial conquest&#x2014;the Great Malayan culture&#x2014;and a common destiny, the New Society. Writing in a four-volume tome titled <b><i><strong>Tadhana</strong> </i></b>(Destiny), 1976, he put forward his view of a people who, after participating in &#x201C;man&#x2019;s universal evolution,&#x201D; would go through a &#x201C;particularization process that would over the centuries produce a racial identity&#x201D; that would later develop into a unique and distinct nation.

Carried out in a scale, scope, and magnitude never seen before and since in the Philippines, the official art program was made possible through a controlled media, a tourism that advertised the humane and cosmopolitan face of the Philippines abroad, a national beautification program led by First Lady Imelda Marcos, who was also appointed as minister of human settlements and governor of Metro Manila (Baluyut 2012). She spearheaded the construction of hotels, <a href=\"/2/5/236\">hospitals</a>, <a href=\"/2/5/225\">schools</a>, housing projects, and even an efficient transport system&#x2014;for example, the Love Bus that linked commercial districts in Cubao and Baclaran via Makati (Herrera 1998)."

Ferdinand commissioned and wrote histories to project a dubious wartime heroism, and a genealogy that supposedly molded Marcos&#x2019;s character as a reformer and political genius, deserving of dynastic rule. Marcos and his wife styled themselves as monarchs through portraits showing them bedecked with aristocratic sash, medals, swords, and crowns. Their portraits would portray them in an idealized style, garbed as royalty, and in Imelda&#x2019;s case juxtaposed with Queen Nefertiti of ancient Egypt. They built structures that looked like palaces: Malaca&#xF1;ang ti Amianan in the North and Imelda&#x2019;s house in Tacloban patterned after the Palace of Versailles. They staged events worthy of royalty, such as the lavish wedding of their youngest daughter in Sarrat, Marcos&#x2019;s hometown in Ilocos Norte."

Like a sentinel, it guarded the gateway leading to Baguio, the summer capital. Its form&#x2014;colossal in scale&#x2014;was a symptom of modernity; its content was archaic. Modern monuments celebrate groups or nations; ancient monuments focus on individuals, and their aristocratic or monarchic statuses and titles. The monument can be seen as a metaphor of Marcos&#x2019;s body and his regime&#x2019;s body politic, with a vein&#x2014;the highway that bears his name&#x2014;that connects north and south and a face made in his image, simultaneously benevolent and stern. The giant bust soared and surveyed its constituents with an unblinking and totalizing gaze that protected its domain and ensured its integrity as a New Society (Baluyut 1994). In 1989, the structure suffered damages by a blast reportedly done by the New People&#x2019;s Army. It was subsequently destroyed in 2002 by bomb blasts from suspected treasure hunters of the Yamashita treasure."

Government hospitals, such as the Philippine Heart Center, became venues of mural paintings with themes celebrating folk traditions. At other times, the couple also appropriated the legend of Maria Makiling. For example, at the dedication ceremony of the Philippine High School for the Arts (PHSA) on 7 Apr 1976, the Marcoses &#x201C;performed&#x201D; their commitment to the arts by referencing the myth of the fabled mountain, on which the school was built. It supported a select group of talented young artists, who after going through a rigorous audition, were entitled to a full scholarship and board and lodging (Baluyut 1994).<i> </i>In her speech, Imelda offered PHSA to her husband, the &#x201C;sensitive dreamer&#x201D; who built the school she described as &#x201C;the allegory of our creative passions,&#x201D; a &#x201C;metaphor of our dreams.&#x201D; In his speech, Ferdinand likened Imelda to a sorceress able to turn &#x201C;dreams into reality and reality into a dream&#x201D;&#x2014;practically a reincarnation of the generous, graceful, and beautiful goddess. School and mountain became the site of the magical translation of the local myth into a &#x201C;national love story between a mortal (Ferdinand) and a goddess (Imelda), who sought to give birth to a New Society of artists&#x201D; (Baluyut 1994, 50). The old is contemporized, myth crosses over to human reality, a mortal turns into a goddess&#x2014;all expressed through the currency of love between superhumans, a love made indistinguishable from a public and national kind of love, love for country."

H.R. Ocampo, a leading figure of the group called the Neo-Realists, painted the social inequalities and the oppression of industrial workers. One of his paintings showed the worker as Christ crucified among chimneys spewing forth pollution; another, <b><i>The Contrast</i></b>, 1940, showed a slum dweller in a hovel against a background of high-rise buildings while partaking of a humble repast.

One group of artists placed much importance on historical research for defining national identity. An example is Carlos Francisco, the Angono-based artist who also worked in popular forms such as the comics, scenographic paintings for the theater, and costume design for the cinema. His knowledge of Philippine history enriched his murals depicting the history of Manila for the Bulwagang Katipunan (Katipunan Hall) at the Manila City Hall and his series on the history of medicine at the Philippine General Hospital. He made a lasting contribution to Philippine genre in paintings that reflected the life of the peasants and fisherfolk of the Laguna and Rizal lakeshore towns.

His Larawan series<b><i> </i></b>(ongoing from 1972) exemplifies these explorations. It linked the precolonial past and the postcolonial present through photographs.

The art historian <a href=\"/3/17/3575\">Alice Guillermo</a> (2001) coined the term &#x201C;<b>social realism</b>&#x201D; in the late 1980s to define the work of Kaisahan and artists associated with them. She links Philippine social realism with the socialist and realist movement in art espoused by artists like Gustave Courbet in the context of the intense republican struggles of 19th-century France. Philippine social realism, she writes, is similarly linked to the liberation movements in the Third World, but developed its own character arising out of its particular historical and cultural specificities. Social realism in the Philippines shares with its global counteparts its political orientation and the belief in art as an agent of social change."

When KM started to mobilize artists in their ranks, a group started to coalesce as early as 1969, and was officially formed in 1971. Called <a href=\"/3/3/3674\">Nagkakaisang Progresibong Artista at Arkitekto (United Progressive Artists and Architects) or NPAA</a>, the group produced art that aimed for greater visual impact and wider accessibility through popular forms such as posters, comics, and cartoons for people&#x2019;s publications. This group set the precedent for a collective formed in 1976&#x2014;Kaisahan (Solidarity), whose members initially included <a href=\"/3/3/3764\">Pablo &#x201C;Adi&#x201D; Baens Santos</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3543\">Edgar Talusan Fernandez</a>, Renato Habulan, <a href=\"/3/3/3519\">Antipas &#x201C;Biboy&#x201D; Delotavo</a>, Papo de Asis, Albert Jimenez, and Jose Cuaresma. They were later joined by Al Manrique, <a href=\"/3/17/3524\">Neil Doloricon</a>, Jose Tence Ruiz, Orlando Castillo, Charles Funk, and the late graphic artist and photographer Vin Toledo who, with printmaker Orlando Castillo, served as political officer and ideologue. This group, according to Guillermo, was the first to be known as &#x201C;social realist.&#x201D; The members of the group who trained as painters&#x2014;Castillo, Baens Santos, Habulan, and Fernandez&#x2014;were already actively exhibiting before the formation of Kaisahan in 1976. They had minimal representation in Marcos&#x2019;s cultural program and in fact was largely excluded from the CCP radar.

Using a variety of styles and media, the artists wove into the fabric of protest and revolutionary art a wide range of themes that captured the incongruities of the New Society. The themes are as follows: the Philippine Revolution of 1896, images of the Filipino, the three basic evils of society (feudalism, bureaucrat capitalism, and imperialism) and the struggles against these, the struggle of indigenous Filipinos, militarization and human rights violations, the threat to ecological balance, religious themes and theology of liberation, the plight of Filipino migrant workers, feminist themes, media censorship, the growth of the mass movement, and the vision of a new order (Guillermo 2001)."

These depict situational images of NPA guerrillas in the field and in educational sessions, village doctors tending to the sick, and scenes of childbirth and death. Another social realist, Al Manrique presented a number of works after coming back from Davao in 1982. A 1983 painting, <b><i>Ang Mabuhay sa Takot </i></b>(To Live in Fear), alludes to hamleting or the relocation of peasants into instant villages so that the military could observe them more closely and isolate them from the guerrillas operating in their villages."

The bifurcation between red and yellow forces is mirrored in spatial terms: Ugarte Field for the Makati elite and Plaza Miranda for the masses. The symbolic and spatial divisions reveal that while, on the surface, all classes and political persuasions were united in a common anti-Marcos cause, on a deeper level the wedge between the classes are so deep-seated. The radical potential of so-called people&#x2019;s power was neutralized by middle-class and elite alternatives, who galvanized themselves as a less radical alternative to the militant mass and national democratic movement. Progressive personalities were gradually replaced by what Guillermo describes as &#x201C;right-wing elements,&#x201D; such as those identified with ultraconservative religious groups and individuals formerly in the military.

First, there was a populist turn manifested in an aversion to state intervention in culture as this was feared to be too associated with the excesses of the deposed regime. Second, there was a growing faith in the capacity of participatory and grassroots-led governance as foil to the centralized mode of cultural management that prevailed through the Marcos years. The consequent aspiration toward a dispersion of power away from the national cultural centers in Manila was proposed as a way to shift the focus from perceptibly elite, National Capital Region-centric art toward emergent local modes of art engagement cognizant of social and area-based nuances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the previous regime, art had served the purpose of the state and crowded out oppositional voices. Rather than enabling the imaginative capacity of Filipinos to creatively engage with complex questions about identity, development, and change, Marcos&rsquo;s cultural managers were perceived by the larger public as merely perpetuating the status of the already privileged. Marcos also had a virtual stranglehold over official narrative-generating institutions such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, the Museum of Philippine Art, Design Center of the Philippines, the Manila Film Center, state-controlled tri-media, and even the physical architecture that would hold up a fabricated image of the New Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With the new administration of Corazon Aquino, a dissident culture that had previously been relegated to the underground during martial law was hopefully construed as the alternative direction for Philippine art, given the newly liberalized state of affairs. The unarticulated myth that underlay post-EDSA public perception was that the Aquino government could work on a fresh, clean slate. The consequent power vacuum brought on by appointees of the past regime yielding their posts occasioned a radical changing of the guard. This new set of cultural administrators and gatekeepers set out to craft a new macrovision of how culture and power should interface. Whereas before they were shutout artists, cultural workers, and intellectuals, they became cultural administrators who advocated a pluralist and multivocal notion of art production and circulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It was in the succeeding administration of President Fidel V. Ramos that an umbrella organization was created to oversee culture and the arts. Previously, in 1992, Aquino&rsquo;s first exective order creating the Presidential Commission on Culture and the Arts (PCCA) was finally enacted into law, which formally created the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>. In 1998, Ramos initiated the creation of a National Museum Complex where the Finance and the Department of Tourism Buildings were to be used by the National Museum. First Lady Amelita &ldquo;Ming&rdquo; Ramos was also active in the art scene, working with Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim in the reconstruction of the Metropolitan Museum. Ming Ramos also started the Katutubong Filipino Foundation to revive Filipino traditions through livelihood, arts, crafts, and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Amidst these developments, the art world was not spared from controversies in the succeeding decades after the EDSA Revolt, when democratic processes in art making and practices came in conflict with institutional power. In 2009, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo named five artists as recipients of the National Artist awards. These artists were not in the list of the original candidates submitted by the selection committee composed of members from the NCCA and the CCP, which outraged civilians and artists. In the same year, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court by National Artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio Almario</a> to prevent Malaca&ntilde;an from conferring the award to these artists. The Supreme Court voided the Arroyo proclamation in 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The term of President Benigno Aquino III witnessed an important controversy. In 2011, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2273\"><strong>Poleteismo</strong></a></strong></i></b>, a work by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3491\">Mideo Cruz</a> that was part of the <b><i>Kulo</i></b> (Boil) exhibit at the CCP, enraged the conservative and religious sectors of society due to the juxtaposition of religious images with pop icons, condoms, and wooden penises. It generated so much controversy that the CCP had to close down the exhibit due to &ldquo;vandalism and threats to its persons&rdquo; (<i>GMA News Online</i> 2011). A case was filed against Cruz and CCP officials by lawyer Manuel Dayrit of the Kapatiran party list accusing them of violating Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code on obscene exhibitions and indecent shows. In 2013, the Office of the Ombudsman ruled that <b><i>Poleteismo </i></b>did not fall under &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; exhibitions. It further added that the work was not &ldquo;lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value as to remove it from the ambit of constitutionally protected expression&rdquo; (Office of the Ombudsman 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Other highlights in art during the Aquino administration was the turnover of the Department of Tourism Building to the National Museum; the display of Philippine artifacts in the possession of museums abroad for the exhibit <b><i>Philippines: Archipel des &Eacute;changes </i></b>(Philippines: An Archipelago of Exchange), 2013, at the Mus&eacute;e du Quai Branly in Paris, France; and the Philippines&rsquo; participation in the 56th Venice Biennale in 2015 after a 50-year hiatus. The Philippine Art Venice Biennale was a collaborative project of the NCCA, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Office of Senator <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4882\">Loren Legarda</a>. In the midst of the resurgence of the presence of Philippine art in various global platforms, the articulation of the shifting meaning of the Filipino experience in the local, national, and diasporic contexts has defined the production, circulation, and reception of art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"decentralizing\" name=\"decentralizing\"></a>Decentralizing Art Institutions </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The move toward the reorientation of how art is understood post-1986 invariably involves restructuring art institutions guided by the lessons of &ldquo;People Power&rdquo; and popular democracy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The Cultural Center of the Philippines</b>. One of the most important tasks at hand after EDSA 1 was the dismantling of the earlier image of state-run institutions, like the Cultural Center of the Philippines, as elitist. Right after assuming the presidency, Corazon Aquino appointed Ma. Teresita Roxas as president of the CCP and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a> as artistic director. Together with several artists and cultural workers, Tiongson then set out to draft the five thrusts that would guide the reorientation of the CCP. The five thrusts were Filipinization, democratization, decentralization, promotion of artistic excellence, and reorientation of international exchanges (Tiongson 2009). The new administrators sought to open the doors of the CCP to artists and audiences of all classes, inviting them in from peripheral regions. Filipinization was at the core of these changes and the new CCP worked to actively support Filipino artists and their works and to promote them not only locally but in other countries as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When the new team took over the CCP on 15 Jul 1986, a series of consultations were held to hear the voices of past administrative officers and artistic directors of the CCP and artists. These consultations led to the implementation of changes such as the restructuring of the CCP into a National Coordinating Center for the Arts. This move led to the opening of the CCP to artists who were marginalized during the Marcos regime, such as the social realists, singers like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4116\">Patatag</a>, and theater groups like the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a> (Tiongson 2009). The CCP Board was also reconstituted to accommodate not only government appointees and those from the business sector but also artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2960\">CB Garrucho</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2480\">Cora I&ntilde;igo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3992\">Erlinda Fule</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo Perez III</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3846\">Jaime Zobel</a>, Oscar Ledesma, and Manolo Agustines. The CCP also invited the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</a> and the University of Santo Tomas Symphony Orchestra to join the expanding resident companies. In the spirit of democratization, the CCP became open to all art styles and legitimized popular art and showcased them through exhibitions such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a>&rsquo;s <i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">komiks</a> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a></b></i>; programs such as the open-air Seranata ng mga Banda, featuring local bass bands; and symposia, screenings, and publications of popular films. In its attempt to evolve from its static elitist position to an active democratic institution, the CCP reached out not only to artists but to Filipino audiences across sectors. This was done by bringing resident companies to perform in venues outside Metro Manila and busing high school students in to watch plays and movies in the CCP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">One of the most significant contributions of the CCP during this era was the reorganization of its outreach and exchange department. In its thrust toward decentralization, art councils were formed in cities outside Metro Manila that would be responsible for &ldquo;gathering local visual, performing and literary artists into an organization that would take care of developing and supporting their own original productions according to the priorities and plans that they would identify and pursue for themselves.&rdquo; These art councils received in-service training in arts management from the CCP in order to create viable and sustainable programs. These councils also received grants from the CCP to train their artists and to encourage them to produce original works of art showcasing their local culture. Art festivals were held in the regions rather than in Manila. Aside from giving grants, the CCP also helped local artists raise funds for their projects by bringing performers, artwork and film exhibitions to their locales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The thrust on Filipinization was concretized by programs ensuring that Filipino artists would benefit from foreign artists invited to the center. Workshops, performances, master classes, artist exchanges, and residencies were organized through funding actively sourced from embassies and patrons. In 1988, the Museo ng Kalinangang Filipino (Museum of Philippine Culture) was opened to showcase a thematic exhibit based on the Filipino concept of <i>diwa</i> (consciousness) utilizing Philippine ethnographic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\">materials</a> to highlight the integration of art, aesthetics, and everyday life. In 1994, the publication of the 10 volumes of the <b><i>Encyclopedia of Philippine Art</i></b>, together with the monographs and video productions of <b><i>Tuklas Sining </i></b>(Discovering Art),<b><i> </i></b>helped in promoting Philippine art and culture to a wider public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The CCP also renamed its performing venues, rehearsal halls, and galleries after Filipino artists. The Main Theater was renamed after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3849\">Nicanor Abelardo</a>, the Little Theater after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a>, the Studio Theater after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Huseng Batute</a>, and the Dream Theater after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>. The Main Gallery was renamed Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>, the Small Gallery was called Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3396\">Fernando Amorsolo</a> while the Little Theater lobby was called Bulwagang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>. CCP instituted venue grants to visual artists to showcase their work wherein various spaces of the building also became exhibit spaces. The corridors at the second, third, and fourth floors became Pasilyo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, Pasilyo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>, and Pasilyo <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>, respectively. The balcony and exterior grounds also became exhibit venues, especially for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\">installation art</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the succeeding decades, the primary thrusts of Filipinization, democratization, decentralization, and artistic excellence remained at the core of the CCP&rsquo;s goals. The CCP continued its outreach programs, supporting Filipino artists and arts in different regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the late 1990s, the cultural development fund would dwindle and reach a critical level, necessitating the succeeding administrations to augment it by lobbying for increases in the annual budget from the government, raising funds through corporate sponsorship and cost-cutting measures (CCP 1999, 4-6). Other problems faced by the succeeding administrators included the deterioration of the physical structure of the CCP Complex. In 1999, a plan was drafted for the development of half of the 60-hectare CCP Complex for commercial purposes to help fund the institution&rsquo;s artistic ventures and projects. By 2004, the CCP had implemented various public relations projects, among them the publication of the <b><i>CCP News Bulletin</i></b>, the adoption of a new corporate logo, the publication of &ldquo;high-impact&rdquo; feature articles in print media, and the establishment of tri-media networking in the regions (CCP 2004). In 2005, the CCP expanded its focus in response to globalization and the opening of world markets. To address the danger of cultural invasion by more powerful and dominant cultures, the CCP formulated a national plan to develop and promote micro, small, and medium artistic and cultural enterprises. Projects were geared toward supporting artists and groups, encouraging them to develop viable and sustainable operations (CCP 2005). The CCP also geared its performances, festivals, cultural events, exhibitions, film showings, and dialogues to reach Filipinos in other countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The National Commission on Culture and the Arts</b>. Before the initial euphoria of EDSA waned, members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a> convened to draft a comprehensive blueprint for the creation of a Ministry of Culture. Aquino&rsquo;s response to this call was the creation of the PCCA through Executive Order 118. It was not until 1992 that this executive order was enacted into law creating the National Commission for Culture and the Arts through Republic Act 7356. The NCCA acts as an umbrella organization enacting policies, coordinating and disbursing grants &ldquo;for the promotion of Philippine Arts and Culture,&rdquo; and administering the National Endowment Fund for Culture. Executive Order 80 placed the CCP, the National Historical Institute, the National Museum, the National Library, and the Records, Management and Archives Office under the NCCA. Republic Act 9155 subsumed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5426\">Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino</a> under the NCCA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The new law underpinning the NCCA as an umbrella cultural institution was to usher in a broader platform of cultural governance that could, in principle, restrain any singularly powerful culture czar or patron from unilaterally deciding the fate of arts and culture produced under state largesse. The reconstituted NCCA institutionalized its core of artist-volunteers as national committee members, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3600\">Jose Joya</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3643\">Mauro Malang</a>, to give these individuals a way to evolve policy and programs from the ground up. Sitting on these committees were pools of artists and cultural workers who were expected to serve as expert voices to feed into how administrators and bureaucrats would logistically oversee a pioneering cultural endowment fund. This endowment fund was gained primarily from a fraction of travel taxes and proceeds from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Access to such highly contested resources would, over the years, become a source of tension among artists with contending affinities. The expectation was that both non-aligned individuals and organizations would have a level playing field within which to compete for monies that could help realize projects that might not find patronage elsewhere. However, it would not take too long after the fervor of the 1986 EDSA Revolt for this to wane. Alongside the limited means to accommodate all competing interests, the initial optimism became weighed down by several factors. The uneven capacities of artists and artists&rsquo; organizations to navigate the intricacies of grant administration, the incompatibility between the working processes of government and creative agents, and the narrow dissemination of information about opportunities for artists were some of the hindrances faced by artists. These eventually led to the slowing down of communication and decision-making. Some disenfranchised sectors were ambivalent toward state mechanisms, which they perceived as disadvantaging practices that did not easily fall within prescribed tropes such as identity, authenticity, and representative culture. Some also perceived that government programming had become precariously more market-oriented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Museums</b>. The post-EDSA 1 period saw the closure of the Museum of Philippine Art and the Design Center of the Philippines. Despite the meager budget allocated for the National Museum in 1986, the museum managed to make modest improvements in their collection, research projects, and branch museums development (National Museum 1986). The Archaeology Division of the National Museum was created in 1988 to conduct researches on prehistory and protohistory of the Philippines through archaeological excavations of land and water sites (National Museum 1986). In the mid-1990s, President Fidel V. Ramos initiated the creation of a National Museum Complex where the Finance and the Department of Tourism (DOT) Buildings were to be turned over for use by the National Museum. The Finance Building was turned over in 1995 and with the transfer of the Senate to Quezon City, the Executive House was also incorporated into the National Museum Complex. Upon the approval of Republic Act 8492 (National Museum Act of 1998) on 12 Feb 1998, the National Museum was reestablished as &ldquo;an autonomous government trust instrumentality under a Board of Trustees &hellip; which designated the President of the Philippines as the Honorary Chairman and Patron of the National Museum&rdquo; (<i>Official Gazette</i> 2016). Also in 1998, the Museum of the Filipino People in the converted Finance Building was inaugurated, featuring ethnographic materials and interactive modules. In 2013, plans were under way to turn the DOT Building into the Museum of Natural History. As a repository of the Philippines&rsquo; natural and cultural heritage, the National Museum has continued to strengthen its collections in the succeeding decades after EDSA 1. The National Museum also continues to undertake researches, exhibitions, projects, and programs in the fields of natural science, social science, culture, and the arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The Metropolitan Museum (MET) continued its operation right after the EDSA Revolt but adopted a new policy of &ldquo;art for all&rdquo; with the aim of bringing the museum closer to Filipinos. Aside from having regular exhibitions of Philippine arts, the MET refined their objectives to include the appreciation of arts of the everyday, expansion of viewership, acquisition of art references from other countries for the appreciation of the Filipino audience, and upgrading of its services and administration (Paulino 2005, 36-7). The museum also featured a bilingual, didactic approach in its first post-EDSA exhibition. Instructional materials, such as signages, guide notes, teachers&rsquo; museum assistants, and monographs, were written in both English and Filipino (Paulino 2005, 37). To further Filipinize the museum&rsquo;s image, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3782\">Felice Sta. Maria</a>, then director of the MET, conceptualized the brown banig (reed woven mats) as opposed to the sterile, elitist, and Western concept of the museum as a white cube. Using the Filipinos&rsquo; affinity with colors, the museum walls were sometimes painted and &ldquo;academic labels were formulated into poetic thought pockets which were trite but high impact&rdquo; (Paulino 2005, 37). The fluid spaces were filled with more materials and the once silent halls were now jarred by piped-in music. What made MET different from the other museums at this time was its focus on the institution as a nonformal space for continuing learning and value formation (Paulino 2005, 37). The MET offered museum apprenticeship for students, volunteer programs for professionals, and traveling exhibits. In the 1990s, it was mired by controversy when rumors spread that the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3435\">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)</a> was to evict the MET and sell its collections. Many artists and cultural workers rallied behind the MET, arguing that it was an important institution that provided spaces for artists to exhibit their works. The controversy died down when the BSP dispelled rumors of the museum&rsquo;s eviction. President Fidel V. Ramos also intervened and ordered Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr, First Lady Amelita Ramos, and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim to assist the MET. A newly renovated MET was then inaugurated in 1994. In the 2000s, MET director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5484\">Victorino Manalo</a> conceptualized a fluid connection between museums and communities through its four-year program Sining at Pamayanan (Paulino 2005, 42-3). This concept was applied in <b><i>Quiapo: The Arts of a City District</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which showcased not only the arts of Quiapo but problems such as overpopulation. With this focus, the MET tapped art as a resource and source of insight to societal issues and problems, &ldquo;thus revitalizing the museum as useful to a broader audience&rdquo; (Manalo in Paulino 2005, 43).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">New museum spaces also opened in the 1990s. While the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) started acquiring artworks in the 1980s, it was only in the 1990s when space was alloted for an art gallery. In Apr 1996, the Museo ng Sining of the GSIS was inaugurated, housing the works acquired by the GSIS, with Dr David Baradas as its first museum director. In 1987, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3599\">Jorge B. Vargas Museum</a> opened in the University of the Philippines. The museum houses the personal collection of Vargas consisiting of more than 500 works from the 19th century to the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Commercial Galleries and Artist-Run Spaces</b>. Fewer than 10 galleries were active in the early years of the Aquino administration, among which were La Galerie of Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise, Madrigal Center, West Gallery, and Brix Gallery (Yusi 2016). The scant number of galleries was attributed to the economic problems that beset the early years of the Aquino administration. The gallery scene began to pick up again in the 1990s when the economy started recovering from its initial slump. The early 1990s saw the opening of Art Walks and galleries in malls, which came about after the successful art show of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3762\">Juvenal Sanso</a> in SM Megamall (Yusi 2016). With the successful sale of Sanso&rsquo;s artworks not only to collectors but also to casual passersby, SM&rsquo;s administration thought it was possible to bring art closer to the public (Yusi 2016). They then transformed level 4 of the SM Megamall as an Art Walk, housing galleries and exhibition spaces. This success was followed later by new galleries in Shangri-La Plaza, Alabang Town Center, and Glorietta 4. In the 1990s, Cubao Expo in Quezon City, which used to be the Marikina Shoe Expo, attracted artists and business people to open galleries and art shops due to the low rent. Due to rental increases in the following decades, only a few galleries have survived in this area today (Yusi 2016). In 2006, Pasong Tamo (now Don Chino Roces Ave) in Makati was transformed from a business district, mostly consisting of car garage shops, to a creative district of galleries, furniture shops, and advertising agencies (del Rosario 2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While galleries continued to open across the country, earlier established artist-run ventures, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3720\">Pinaglabanan Galleries</a> and ArtLab, would close shop or shift operational modes from gallery operations to project management by the 1990s. Rather than tending established modern artists, commercial galleries opted to support contemporary work, which would later become the staples of the current mainstream gallery circuit. These include Contreras Sculpture, Crucible Gallery, Finale Art File, Galeria de las Islas, Galeria Duemila, Gallery Genesis, Liongoren Art Gallery, Madrigal Art Center, among others. These made up the first set of galleries that would turn out such collaborative projects as the themed joint exhibit series Art Manila, and preliminary research for artist raisonn&eacute;s of National Artists under the NCCA&rsquo;s gallery committee grant window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1990s, alternative art spaces were opened by artists who did not want to work within the established gallery system and who felt that there was never enough cultural and infrastructural support from the government (del Rosario 2016). Examples of nonprofit artist-run spaces are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3786\">Surrounded by Water</a>, Big Sky Mind and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3572\">Green Papaya Art Projects</a>, Artery, Black Soup, the Department of Avant-Garde Cliches, Future Prospects, Junk Shop, Lost Projects, Kanto, Mag:net, 98B, Post, Sands Gallery, Sigwa da, Syano, Tambayang Makiling, Third Space, and Underground.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Over the years, with the aging of artists and patrons and diminished circulation of work in the secondary market, commercial spaces and sites that came after them, like 1335 Mabini, Brix Gallery, Manila Contemporary, Silverlens, among others, became more relatively in sync with the programming of artist-run spaces, which were more open-ended. This shift in the mainstream, along with the accelerated organizing among artists, had, at various junctures, parallels outside Manila, such as Caf&eacute; Memento and Mariyah Gallery in Dumaguete, Enigmata Treehouse in Camiguin, Greenhouse Effect Gallery Ili-Likha Artist&nbsp;Village, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3791\">Tam-awan Village</a> and VOCAS in Baguio, Kamarikutan in Palawan, Karumata in Cagayan de Oro, Linya Gallery in Iligan, Lun&aacute; in Cebu, Orange Gallery in Bacolod, Project Space Pilipinas in Quezon Province, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Assertions of Autonomy and Art Initiatives</b>. The emergence of the less structured, informally operating artist-run organizations was an international phenomenon viewed as organic response to citizens&rsquo; fatigue over seeing culture instrumentalized, with art being made to service traditional agendas of individual politicians or by the state as a whole. As artist-run ventures globally are wont to do, these usually spartan undertakings variably succeeded in sustaining themselves. Meanwhile, older formations&mdash;such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3449\">Black Artists in Asia</a>, Concerned Artists of the Philippines, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3605\"><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Kababaihan</span></em> sa Sining at Bagong Sibol na Kamalayan</a>, Pampanga Arts Guild, the Saturday Group of Artists&mdash;and other media-based, advocacy-driven, art school-born groupings, like Angono Ateliers Association and Junior Ateliers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2741\">Anino Shadowplay</a>, Anting-Anting&nbsp;Artists&rsquo; Circle, Grupong ANG, Hulo, New World Disorder, Printmakers Association of the Philippines, Salingpusa (then <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3761\">Sanggawa</a>), Society of Philippine Sculptors, TAMA, Tutok, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3809\">UGATLahi</a>, among many others, would persevere or hibernate within an increasingly crowded field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Outside of Manila, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3430\">Baguio Arts Guild</a> admirably ran its pioneering international art festivals (Baguio International Arts Festival or BIAF) through 2002, with the Tam-awan International Art Festivals and AXIS Baguio taking up after the BIAF&rsquo;s demise. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3680\">Neo-Angono Artists&nbsp;Collective</a>, on the other hand, would begin its annual public art festivals in 2004. Artist-staged exchanges between organizations would also yield an organic translation of forms, such as installation and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\">performance</a>, in cross-regional contexts. The network of Visayan artists&rsquo; organizations grew in size as it gathered for region-wide assemblies like <b><i>VIVA ExCon</i></b> beginning 1990, while the much more modest network of Davao&ndash;Cagayan de Oro&ndash;Iligan artists and organizations that fueled the Mindanaoan initiative <b><i>Panit Bukog</i></b><i> </i>(Skin and Bone) was also enabled by curator Bobi Valenzuela in 2004. These artists&rsquo; formations would reach out to local and international peers as it had become more feasible to travel for purposes of residencies, exchanges, and reciprocal exhibitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To a certain degree, the tussle between programmatic and more open-ended organizing and laboratory-type work serves as an alternative force to official and market-driven culture. The counterbalancing of these politicized cultural practices has become a subject in some artists&rsquo; works. An example is Filipino-American filmmaker Angel Shaw&rsquo;s 2014 project, <b><i>Markets of Resistance: A Visual and Interdisciplinary Trade-Barter Exhibition</i></b>, which consisted of intrepid installations and performances and the occupation of market stalls in Baguio City&rsquo;s public market. In this event, artists were asked to make objects that could be bartered in kind where no money was exchanged. The exhibition decentralized market forces by resituating Baguio as a precolonial site where barter trade was practiced and by bringing the works of artists to the general public. The event or show was meant as a process of &ldquo;connecting people and ideas rather than of producing&rdquo; (de Veyra 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This pull toward decentralization may be seen as a global phenomenon, with the concentration of political power shifting from nation-states to global capital. The seeming dissolution of a singular notion of creative site of practice is being fueled by the increasing mobility of Filipinos moving in incremental waves to territories in need of labor to fill in cultural capital gaps in what would later be construed as creative industries. For example, visual artists seek employment as animators for global entertainment companies abroad. However, the thriving of popular movements and developmental NGOs able to reach communities without rigid protocols and beyond traditional political centers provided momentum to artist-initiated and community-run spaces and cultural initiatives. Artists disinclined to work within imposed megastructures found it possible to resist global consumerist trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Artist-initiated museums, such as those of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3443\">Ben Cabrera</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3694\">Ramon Orlina</a>, are another dimension of self-production and circulation. This is an emergent trend in Asia along with self-published works, like those on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3677\">J. Elizalde Navarro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3376\">Napoleon Abueva</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3387\">Gus Albor</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3836\">Phyllis Zaballero</a>, among others; collector-initiated publications like <b><i>Art after War</i></b>; and the series of themed releases from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3710\">the collection of Paulino and Hetty Que</a>, which includes <b><i>Meaning to Be Modern</i></b>, <b><i>Philippine Paintings from 1907 to 1959</i></b>, and <b><i>Imagining Identity: <strong>100</strong> Filipino Self-Portraits</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Alternatives to a Monolithic Culture amidst the Need for Distinction</b>. Over the past three post-EDSA decades, the state continues to count on its cultural agencies to attend to its need to build consensus around notions of patriotism, citizenship, and governance. Thus state mechanisms, such as awards and grants, continue to recognize artists and cultural workers. Aside from the art grant mechanisms set up under the post-Marcos National Commission for Culture and the Arts, state recognition for the arts would eventually get reestablished by way of the continued awarding of the National Artists, the reestablishment of the Gawad CCP para sa Sining in 1989, and the institution of the Gawad sa Manlilikha ng Bayan in 1992 to redress the perceived bias against the work done by traditional and folk artists. By 1999, the Cultural Center of the Philippines not only launched its Centennial Honors for the Arts but also revived the Thirteen Artists Awards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The National Artists for visual arts recognized during this period include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3391\">Federico Alcuaz</a>, Benedicto Cabrera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3477\">Francisco Coching</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3589\">Abdulmari Imao</a>, Jose Joya, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3400\">Ang Kiukok</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3618\">Cesar Legaspi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3635\">Arturo Luz</a>, J. Elizalde Navarro, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3686\">Hernando Ocampo</a>; the Manlilikha ng Bayan awardees, on the other hand, are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5120\">Ginaw Bilog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3667\">Salinta Monon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3527\">Lang Dulay</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3769\">Darhata Sawabi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3403\">Haja Amina Appi</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3673\">Eduardo Mutuc</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3556\">Magdalena Gamayo</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3564\">Teofilo Garcia</a>. Visual artists accorded the Gawad CCP, the institution&rsquo;s lifetime achievement award, include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\">Brenda Fajardo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3471\">Roberto Chabet Rodriguez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3671\">Pitoy Moreno</a>, and Ben Farrales. Meanwhile, the first batch of CCP Thirteen Artist Awardees after 1986 is composed of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3411\">Agnes Arellano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3541\">Roberto Feleo</a>, Peter de Guzman, Pardo de Leon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3729\">Dan Raralio</a>, Popo San Pascual, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3749\">Jose Tence Ruiz</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3793\">Gerardo Tan</a>, awarded in 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Moreover, private platforms such as the Ateneo Art Awards and national art competitions put up by corporations&mdash;like the Metrobank Foundation&rsquo;s M.A.D.E., Philippine Art Awards of the Philip Morris Group of Companies, and the long-running student competition launched by Pilipinas Shell Corporation&mdash;have broadened the modes of validation in the visual arts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As Filipinos continue to move, settle, and think about their own sense of place and evolve more complex ideas about home, authenticity, and creative translation amidst rapidly changing contexts of everyday culture, artists and cultural workers are now more frequently dealing with the exchange of concepts, forms, and the technology in the production of art. Thus the privileging of identity discourse as a theme, which firmly took hold after World War II, has mellowed and given way to more vibrant formulations of what constitutes Filipino creativity, relevant content, and viable creative space. What has become increasingly evident in the work of younger artists is the veering toward a more globalized thematic. This stands in contrast to the much more introspective stream of the 1980s and partially of the 1990s. Partly due to the ease in which information now travels digitally, artists and organizers have taken on post-identity questions that range from notions of global citizenship, queries on migration, climate change, and consumerism, which are shared across many national sites. Artists also tap digital platforms to present their work and explore alternate modes of producing art, which also make possible interfaces with those beyond Philippine borders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among other triggers, the diversified media sphere has led to the consolidation of bigger museum institutions as they have sought to align programming and audience development, the sharing and exchange of resources, and synching of expertise. On the other hand, patron relations have also utilized these alignments to give rise to multi-venue exhibitions featuring single-artist projects as in the case of the 2008 <b><i>His Art, Our Heart</i></b> Fernando Amorsolo seven-museum program, and the <b><i>Half a Century of <strong>BenCab</strong></i></b> series of events in 2015. As for the NCCA, increasing privileging of ethnolinguistic programming under the present leadership has been behind the annual Dayaw festivals, and where even the NCCA&rsquo;s annual Philippine art festivals have emphasized the trope of indigeneity. Some of these initiatives have been notably spectacle-scale international exposure events, such as the sending of key cultural objects for the Quai Branly exhibition <b><i>Philippines: An Archipelago of Exchange</i></b>, 2013. This happened alongside kindred private initiatives, such as the San Francisco Asian Art Museum exhibition <b><i>Philippine Gold: Treasures of Forgotten Kingdoms</i></b>, 2015-16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Decentralized Discourses of Art</b>. The mid-1980s saw the realigning of political borders in Europe&rsquo;s post-Cold War environs and the contingent wearing away of long-running dictatorships in postcolonial governments in Asia and Latin America. Alongside this phenomenon was the reshaping of histories and their production. Virtually throughout the Asian region, the shared project of many local scholars became the writing of more contextualized accounts of their own modernities and contemporaneities, and the writing back of evidences of precolonial culture into their own histories amidst imperial impositions from within Asia itself and/or Euro-America. This instinctive recourse to a self-determined present and prouder past would slowly gain ground and become institutionalized through area studies as well as interdisciplinary courses in various universities and research centers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The fluidity of art categories affected curatorial practices as seen in the way exhibitions are no longer categorically distinguished as exclusively showing art or the solely ethnographic. The transdisciplinal questions posed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3706\">Marian Pastor-Roces</a> in <b><i>Pang-ulo: Filipino Ideas about Heads, Headgear and Head of Community </i></b>at the National Museum, 2005, and those asked in the series curated by Patrick Flores&mdash;<b><i>Influx: Transpositions in Philippine Modernism</i></b>, <b><i>Intimation: Compromises of Self</i></b>, <b><i>Incarnation: Disarming Figurations</i></b>, <b><i>Inclination: Across</i></b> <b><i>Origin, Within Sight</i></b>, and <b><i>Inculcation: Museum as Nation</i></b>&mdash;also at the National Museum, 2006, reveal this wearing down of borders. Still another illustrative case is the series of NCCA-funded national visual arts exhibitions called <b><i>Sungdu-an </i></b>(Confluence), which was first undertaken by curators <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3425\">Virgilio Aviado</a>, Bobi Valenzuela, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3462\">Imelda Cajipe-Endaya</a> in 1996 and which went on till 2009 with curators Dennis Ascalon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3607\">Irma Lacorte</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3728\">Claro Ramirez</a>, and Christopher Rollo. Some of the significant lessons borne of the <b><i>Sungdu-an</i></b> experience included cultural workers developing a more acute sense of the disparate conditions faced by artists and organizers working out of Manila who often had to make do given the dearth in suitable venues, publications, channels for feedback, and updated training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, the critical literature on visual art produced after martial law still pales in comparison to that seminal era when both state and private interests converged in churning out titles such as <b><i>Archipelago</i></b>, <b><i>Filipino Heritage</i></b>, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Kayamanan series,<b><i> Pamana</i></b>,<b><i> Philippine Art Supplement</i></b>, and <b><i>San Juan</i></b>, among many others. Some significant publications that have come forth since 1986 are the CCP&rsquo;s <b><i>Ani</i></b>, <b><i>Encyclopedia of Philippine Art</i></b>, <b><i>Kultura</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>and <b><i>Tuklas Sining</i></b>; NCCA&rsquo;s <b><i>Araw</i></b> and <b><i>Sanghaya</i></b>; the Reader&rsquo;s Digest&rsquo;s Kasaysayan volumes; and artist-initiated publications <b><i>Pananaw</i></b>: <b><i>Philippine Journal of Visual Arts </i></b>and <b><i>Transit</i></b>. The increasingly professionalized infrastructure of the gallery system made competitive with the influx of foreign dealers and gallerists pursuing Filipino artists has also spurred the more consistent publication of catalogues both for local and art fair-bound showings. On the more commercial front are magazines like <b><i>Art Plus</i></b>. Apart from limited-edition artists&rsquo; books and the occasional privately funded tomes, such as <b><i>Artes delas Filipinas: Private Collections</i></b>, 2009, and <b><i>Without Walls: A Tour of Philippine Paintings at the Turn of the Millennium</i></b>, 2010, a modest number of substantial material on precolonial culture went to press, such as <b><i>Paths of Origin: The Austronesian Heritage</i></b>, 2011, <b><i>Ancestral Gold</i></b>, 2012, and <b><i>Philippines: Archipelago of</i></b> <b><i>Exchange</i></b>, 2013. The onset of primarily web-hosted writing, on the other hand, is being undertaken by young enterprising initiatives&mdash;such as Planting Rice, 98B, DiscLab, Diskurso, among others&mdash;which are exploring how digital formats enable critique and general discourse rendered in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\">multimedia</a>. Apart from initiating project-based research, exhibitions, and/or administering modest residencies/fellowships, these platforms have turned out writing consisting of reportage and critique alongside increasingly interdisciplinary academe-initiated volumes such as <b><i>Humanities Diliman</i></b>, <b><i>Kritika Kultura</i></b>, <b><i>Philippine Humanities Review</i></b>, <b><i>Philippine Studies</i></b>, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">From the 1986 EDSA Revolt onward, artists have continued to defy categories and ready-made formulations about how art should figure in the public sphere. Simultaneously, adherents of more classical and traditional practice continue to produce work that may or may not easily get enfolded into the market and contemporary discourse. In general, however, artists who receive attention are those who more readily find recourse in pastiche or appropriation by weaving together discrepant motifs, toning down singular authorship, and occasionally refusing to deal with historicization by resorting to iconoclasm, parody, and irony. The broad range of work produced runs the gamut of the patronizingly representative, the frankly didactic, to the loosely woven together pop and folk culture references posed as diatribes against mainstream thought systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The digital platform has become a broadly accessible channel that allows younger, less-privileged artists, organizers, and writers to circumvent the much more heavily guarded institutional routes that are generally slower to take their practice into the larger realm of the newer media. The compacted formats and speeds at which information has become available through Web 2.0 and higher enable not just the production of alternate discourse but also the making and circulating of artistic work in modes previously known to and within reach of only a few. The emergence of memes, zines, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2117\">sound work</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\">video</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, and bantering among artists and thinkers via the informal and sometimes clandestine chatter over portable media like pirate radio and social network platforms extends the possibilities of self-curation and building up of contact circles. Works in these forms also spread through wider circuits that are increasingly cheaper to work with and transmit through. This is done by activating physical and virtual spaces through paralegal or bootleg occupations of sites, the making of sound environments, performance, and video art that may or may not be crowdsourced. More importantly, these newer modes of making and encountering art occasion a comparatively more participatory counterflow of ideas. These channels facilitate interaction, even sometimes enabling more frequent physical and virtual homecomings or reintroductions of Filipino artists previously less visible to local art publics. One clear-cut case is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3658\">David Medalla</a>&rsquo;s London Biennale extending satellite presences in other continents where Filipino and non-Filipino artists have chosen to respond to his mega art spectacle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nevertheless, the swift inroads in digital imaging technology and networked data interfaces have indeed spurred a much increased ability among artists in general so that they are able to self-document and, in a real sense, wield control over their own public representation. This development, and the emergence of more active and aggressive artist-curators, also patently broadens the democratic space for practice that does not always readily fit into categories set by academe and other cultural institutions with specific agendas. One-off, transient online platforms as modes of making sites of art practice have, for instance, made possible a more organic though not always unproblematic fusing of the work of artists from various fields such as design, music, dance, theater, film, visual art, etc. Illustrative of this stream is the annual experimental sound art initiative called WSK, organized by Merv Espina with Tengal Drilon, who is also behind more project-based/event initiatives like SABAW Media Kitchen and Terminal Garden. Parallel to this is the Art in the Park pop-up mode already appropriated by real estate promoters who have been insinuating art into community programming through periodic events, including affordable art fairs. Reminiscent of the exploration in terms of space that occurred in the 1970s, other loosely-configured, multimedia, multisite, and avowedly public interventions have also been done by AXIS Baguio, Back to Square 1&rsquo;s Off Site / Out of Sight, Neo-Angono&rsquo;s annual public art festivals, 98B through its team-up with the Escolta commercial association, Windang Aesthetics Labor Army (W.A.L.A.) via the multi-collective Botcha squat occupations, and the several installments of the Bagasbas and Malasimbo festivals. As a whole, being able to take on the tasks of scripting and organizing have allowed artists themselves to craft their own narratives. Some artists even propose clashing stories about their own trajectories in relation to larger questions on art and culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><a id=\"international\" name=\"international\"></a>International Circulation of Art</b>. Exhibition platforms, whether brick or mortar or virtual, saw a rise of the occasional cross-regional exhibition platforms in fairs or private gallery settings, outpacing the need for art writing and criticism. One major difference between the 1990s and more recent decades is the lack of museum-scale displays of international art in the Philippines. These displays were previously made possible by organizations such as the Japan Foundation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which aggressively organized exchanges in the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Prior to the broader opening up of both public and private opportunities for residencies, artists and cultural workers found support through multilateral undertakings&mdash;like the ASEAN Travelling Exhibit of Painting, Photography, and Children&rsquo;s Art&mdash;across member countries. On other interstate institutional fronts, exchanges and conferences would be enabled by the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, Asia Society, the Australian Artists&rsquo; Regional Exchange, Southeast Asian Studies Regional Exchange Program, and later by other international windows like the Alliance Fran&ccedil;aise Philippines networking-residency programs, Asian Cultural Council, and the Asian Public Intellectuals Fellowship of the Nippon Foundation. These meant an increased exposure and visibility for Philippine art alongside the heightened representation of Filipinos in the seminal Fukuoka Asian Art Shows, which evolved into the Fukuoka Triennale, and the Queensland Art Gallery&rsquo;s Asia-Pacific Triennials prior to the proliferation of biennales across the world. Through the decades, Filipino artists would be traveling out to key international events&mdash;such as the biennales in Havana, Melbourne, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Yokohama, and Documenta, among others&mdash;as official Philippine representatives or as artists working out from their present countries of residence. The escalating importance of Asia-based platforms, such as those in Dhaka, Gwangju, Jakarta, Shanghai, Singapore, and Taipei, would subsequently serve to counterpoint the high-profile regional art fairs and local/international art auctions that now powerfully play into the trading and making of reputations of artists from the region. After a hiatus of 50 years, the Philippines returned to participate in the oldest perennial, the 2015 Venice Biennale, with a team made up of Patrick Flores, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3668\">Manny Montelibano</a>, and Jose Tence Ruiz under a curatorial platform <b><i>Tie a String around the World</i></b>, which plays up a reverse imperial trajectory in the Asian incursion into Europe of the Mongol military leader Genghis Khan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The counterpoint to this development, however, are smaller-scale efforts to stage showings of work from both Philippine-based artists and their peers practicing elsewhere. Two examples of this would be the <b><i>Galleon Trade</i></b> exhibitions curated by Jenifer Wofford and done at Green Papaya Art Projects and Mag:net Gallery, 2007, and <b><i>Collage Drop Outs </i></b>curated by Isabel Ching and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3472\">Mariano Ching</a> at Finale Art File in 2011. The generally unstructured international exchange-residencies that have been undertaken through collectives, like 98B, Project Space Pilipinas, and Neo-Angono, have been generally sustained thus far. Meanwhile in the performance art circuit, the launching of international festivals beginning in the 1990s onward triggered a resurgence of performative work initially within high-traffic public spaces like Luneta and Malate, then later on taking festival content through the university circuit, and on the road through Philippine provinces and cities like Lipa, Batangas, Lingayen, Pangasinan, and Santiago, Isabela. These gestures of occupation of new spaces of production, reception, and circulation, which not only characterize work in performance but also in transmedia, might prove to be what distinguish this period from preceding robust developmental phases of Philippine art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Philippine art has been aggressively collected by international museums as evidenced by acquisitions or commissions undertaken for the Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, the Queensland Art Gallery / Gallery of Modern Art, the Singapore Art Museum, and, more recently, Centre Georges Pompidou, the Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative, the National Gallery Singapore, New Museum, and Mori Art Museum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The globalization of economies resulted in an active market of art produced in Asia, including the Philippines. Thus art auction houses, such as Sotheby&rsquo;s and Christies, have become active promoters in the circulation of artworks, possibly influencing aesthetic issues in conjunction with marketability. This easier access to once locked-off channels may in some way be seen as affecting the level of activity among artist-run spaces whose initiators inevitably get enfolded into the mainstream. This is also a demonstration of how the market is able to accommodate even what are initially posed as alternative practices. This phenomena may also be observed on the commoditization of artworks employing social realism and conceptual art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from an escalating presence in international auctions and the biennale-perennial circuit, an increasing number of pre-mid-career artists have been figuring in international initiatives such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3795\">Maria Taniguchi</a>&rsquo;s clinching of the 2015 Hugo Boss Prize. More senior artists have also been receiving recognition abroad, such as in the case of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3822\">Carlos Villa</a>&rsquo;s archival material becoming accessioned by the Smithsonian; David Medalla&rsquo;s exhibiting his work at Tate Britain, 2012; and the <em><strong>MAM Research 002: Who Was Roberto Chabet?</strong></em> initiative at Mori Museum, 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In this volatile climate, a new set of artists would assert that their own subjectivities are in perpetual construction, producing works resistant to easy categories such as social realist-conceptual, local-global, and so on. Artists would argue for dynamic redefinitions due to how mobile and racially diverse Filipinos have become. And because of how inescapably tied up in culture change this idea of self and subjectivities was turning into, both artists and theorists caution against rigid pronouncements anchored on notions of racial purity and clear-cut territorial affinities. One such key example of this stream would be the series of exhibitions undertaken in Europe, Asia, and North America by the loose group of artists making up the Bastards of Misrepresentation, which include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3398\">Poklong Anading</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3434\">Yason Banal</a>, Argie Bandoy, Bea Camacho, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3475\">Lena Cobangbang</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3484\">Louie Cordero</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3489\">Maria Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3498\">Gaston Damag</a>, Arvin Flores, Dina Gadia, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3610\">Robert Langenegger</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3617\">Romeo Lee</a>, Pow Martinez, Manuel Ocampo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3692\">Jayson Oliveria</a>, Carlo Ricafort, Gerardo Tan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3834\">MM Yu</a>, and Zoleta. Parallel to this deliberately nebulous stream of organizing is the continued work of nationalist political art organizations such as Alay Sining, Gerilya, Karatula, Molotov, Sining Bugkos, and other similar affiliations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contested responses to questions about how artists ought to negotiate with transnational forces bearing upon art&rsquo;s autonomy and social functions reveal the tension between the individual capacity to enable continuities with regard to tradition, along with the creative momentum needed to effect transformation. Specifically in regard to internal and external migration, not a few artists have privileged still unfolding narratives variably grounded in appropriated positionalities, as opposed to those merely inherited and foreclosed within the confines of nation-states and other arbitrary localities. One concrete example of this is the work of Filipino-American Stephanie Syjuco, <b><i>Empire Garden</i></b>, 2015, where her live botanical rendering of the history of empire comes together in the form of an ongoing makeshift laboratory project that hopes to grow tobacco, cotton, indigo, poppy, and corn under artificial conditions. As more works get produced by artists of Filipino ancestry who live as transients or as dual citizens and thus may possess more than singular loyalties to any one country, questions of stake and patrimonial anchors have become more and more complicated and laborious to reconcile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Subsectionhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><span style=\"font-weight:bold\"><a id=\"visual\" name=\"visual\"></a>The Visual Arts: Themes, Materials, and Techniques</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the face of aggressive globalization and its effect on the human condition, theorists, critics, and historians have been challenged to develop an ability to read from and beyond immediate contexts as well as reckon with parallelisms in nearby country-states or territories with similar historico-cultural trajectories and parallel predicaments of definition, such as in Southeast Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America. Constant recalculations about how art and culture positions itself in regard to the categories of local-global-glocal continue to occupy policymakers and those working at the grassroots with their more immediate concerns of efficacy, legibility, and sustainability. The artist as consummate image and meaning-maker is expectedly thrust in this complex conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The visual art forms that were produced post-1986 may be understood in thematical threads that saw the close integration of form, content, and discourses, affected by the modes of production, circulation, and reception of art in the local, national, and global spheres. While an older generation of artists continue to express through their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2109\">painting</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2116\">sculpture</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2115\">printmaking</a>, and photography, younger artists experimented with art forms that transcended the old art categories, such as <b>installation art</b>, which assemble objects in a given space; <b>site-specific art</b>, which include the particular nuances of the space into the artwork; <b>performance art</b> or the focusing on action or performativity as central to the artwork; <b>video art,</b> which employs the projection of moving images; <b>digital art</b>, which utilizes computer-generated images; <b>sound art</b>, which uses sound as core art element; <b>transmedia art</b> or the mixing of multiple media; and <b>hypermedia arts</b>, which employs gaming technology and components of networked elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Image-Making and Identity Discourse</b>. Identity discourse as subject matter in art remains operative under these complex conditions&nbsp;albeit in a much more nuanced vein. Two winning pieces from the Philippine Art Awards help illustrate at least two approaches artists have adopted within the realm of figurative painting. First off is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3536\">Alfredo Esquillo</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Daang Ligid-Krus</i></b>, 1996, which demonstrates classical painting technique on what was then a novel painting ground of rubber. The work is a deft rendering of extremely lifelike details in a scene of folk religious devotees making their way through a devotional route laid out in maze configuration, which could be read as souls navigating predetermined paths even when counting on the existence of options. Specific points in the maze are punctuated by iconic folk motifs like town musicians, indigenized and infantilized Christ image, amulets, and other devotional instruments amidst secular devices like live TV sets, drink, and porn. Esquillo&rsquo;s is a type of image-making that draws heavily from local references even as its narrative is not straightforwardly as prescriptive or moralistic as visual materials in school used to be mandated. This anecdotal slice is arguably open that multiple readings could be made around and about it. The second piece for consideration is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3562\">Nona Garcia</a>&rsquo;s <b><i>See Saw</i></b>, 2000, which is indicative of how most Filipino artists remain preoccupied with draughtmanship&mdash;in this case, down to the creases, even as this work is coupled with an interest in addressing the realization that the most &ldquo;real&rdquo; of images are subject to the complexities of truth telling. <b><i>See Saw</i></b> is both verbal and visual pun, where the seen and unseen are dually questioned given that the painting of a chainsaw, however delicately bundled up and thus hidden, is remarkably realistic whereas the unwrapped chainsaw subjected to the piercing radiographic lenses of an X-ray machine is rendered visible but also almost unreal because of its being visually mediated through another layer of vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While demonstrating the kind of hyperrealist strain of image-making that continues to be popular among many Filipinos, these artists&rsquo; image-making practices also still do demonstrate the polarities in thinking about what is and what could be, and how mimesis or verisimilitude can or cannot be the be-all and end-all of seeing and knowing. The shock aesthetic that overlays the work of artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3619\">Jose Legaspi</a> with his representations of homoerotic trauma, for instance, strongly challenges the inherently traditional association that hyperrealist painting has earned. Another work that hews to a graphic-conceptualist vein is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3519\">Antipas Delotavo</a>&rsquo;s centennial mural <b><i>Dantaon</i></b>, 1998, which not only readily registers as a Philippine history narrative but also poses a conceptual challenge to the traditional view of history as tightly bound up through events and one-dimensional personages constructed by the writing of historians and the interventions of media and popular reading. The deliberately unfinished progression of characters and motion sequence illustrates how the visual communicates through both the cognitive and affective senses. Lastly, another demonstration of how figuration can be construed more conceptually is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3639\">Lani Maestro</a>&rsquo;s drawings of body parts for her installation <b><i>Poem without a Country</i></b>, 1988, done in reference to human rights abuses perpetuated even during post-EDSA regimes. Just as in another piece, <b><i>A Wound in the Lung</i></b>, 1994, a room-size installation of a mound of soil within which a human-scale cavity was left, Maestro&rsquo;s desire to engage with arguably humanist themes is rendered in the work subtly to perhaps not just resonate with narrowed local context like Philippine militarization but also to effect conversations with other visual cultures that may have affinities in experience, but not with such locally recognizable references.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Nonetheless, a more straightforwardly identitarian mode is still operative for other artists. In the case of National Artist BenCab, for instance, in regard to his already politically charged installments of the Sabel<b><i> </i></b>series, the female figurative motif has become more and more associated with a universalized reference to either a maternal icon for nation, or as stand-in for the everyday woman in swirling turn-of-the-century dress overlaid with plastic wrap. A more complicated position taken in regard to issues of subject and representation may be found in the work of Gaston Damag whose backhanded imaging of his roots in Banaue takes form in violence-laden vignettes of the <b>bulol</b> physically subjected to pressure and wearing down in exhibitionary contexts. This is in contrast to a predilection for nostalgically referring to a &ldquo;purer&rdquo; past seen in the practice of the de Guia brothers&mdash;Kidlat Jr in his photographic images of a rapidly transforming mountain city, Kabunian&rsquo;s lowbrow aesthetic realized in collaborative and publicly sited mosaics, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3506\">Kawayan</a>&rsquo;s more urbane found object critique of globalizing influences trudging upon everyday Filipino consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">These contrasting perspectives about how visual strategies play into questions of representation and critical inquiry are borne of a growing suspicion over national identity discourse flattening differences among ethnicities. Critics have construed this tendency as a ploy to lure artists into docile participation in visual homogenizing projects, of turning out uncritical citizens merely submitting to the self-indulging tenets of a form of globalization that perpetuates a sense of self without regard for communal contexts. Consequently, resistant strains have taken a broad range of forms and have unevenly been underpinned by theory and critique&mdash;with some work often coming across as knee-jerk impulse pushing artists to play anywhere between the continuum of aimless truant to sharp critic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In no small part due to the digital sphere&rsquo;s growing emphasis on self-fashioning manifested in the padding of profiles, blogging, avatar-making, and so on, the parallel turn to the self in biography-laced work of artists is also an evident stream of image construction. This is seen in differing degrees in the wide range of performative work of David Medalla, to the dour alter egos <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3558\">Lyra Garcellano</a> crafts in her print and online comic strips. This conjuring of multiple selves and/or invoking of personal biography also manifests in other more tactile forms as in the punk sculpture tableau self-tribute of Romeo Lee, the folksy reference to Angono&rsquo;s festival procession in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3805\">Wire Tuazon</a>&rsquo;s casting himself for <b><i>Endramada</i></b>, and the printmaking gone three-dimensional stretched latex work of Ambie Aba&ntilde;o.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even as a still resurgent critical impulse propels a significant amount of post-EDSA work done by elder social realists and younger activist-artists traversing the range from easel to mural painting and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2099\">effigies</a>, more work in the installative vein has also surfaced in this respect. Instances include Reamillo and Juliet&rsquo;s site-specific reference to Marcos excesses and cover-ups in <b><i>Black Hole</i></b>, 1993, at the former Manila Film Center, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3463\">Buen Calubayan</a>&rsquo;s literally rat-infested <b><i>On Spectacle and (Other) Awkward Rules on Killing by Means of Natural Selection</i></b>, 2009, for the CCP Thirteen Artists exhibition of that year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>The Appropriation of Local Image/Object as Means to Decolonization</b>. The propensity to employ what was counted as lost then found motifs and images of premodern and even colonial circulation is still popular among some artists. We note this persistent strain for instance in the painting and sculptural work of the Baldemor siblings Lito and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3432\">Manuel</a>, Nemiranda, the Blanco family of painters, among many others. There is also, among much younger practitioners, a period photography-pegged aesthetic that informs the collages of artists such as Joven Mansit, or earlier in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3547\">Karen Flores</a>&rsquo;s and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3603\">Mark Justiniani</a>&rsquo;s paintings from the 1990s onward as they invoked <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3525\">Damian Domingo</a>&rsquo;s <b>tipos del pais</b> illustrations to enable critique from an overtly historical perspective. The once highly potent political charge emitted by such images, however, has become neutered in the way some painters may have inadvertently participated in the circulation of these images as exotic tourist fare or as sheer stylistic flourish easily depoliticized through branding and the workings of hipsterism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While not necessarily directly participating in decolonizing discourse, surrealist and abstract-inclined painters and sculptors working from an impulse to look broadly, and not just to Euro-America, have continued to produce competent work. Among these are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3378\">Ronald Achacoso</a>, Gus Albor, Zeus Bascon, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3486\">Allan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3424\">Ivi Avellana-Cosio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3458\">Benjie</a> and Zean Cabangis, Maria Cruz, Troy Ignacio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3595\">Eugene Jarque</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3611\">Lao Lianben</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3661\">Jose Mendoza</a>, the father and son <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3691\">Romulo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3690\">Jonathan Olazo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3698\">Bernardo Pacquing</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3718\">Imelda Pilapil</a>, Roberto Robles, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3758\">Rodolfo Samonte</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3765\">Soler Santos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3828\">Nestor Vinluan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3835\">Reginald Yuson</a>, Phyllis Zaballero, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3838\">Alvin Zafra</a>, among many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">What were initially called siteworks, environments, then eventually installations in the 1970s, art literature were born from a wide range of persuasions, from those referencing modernist discourse as seen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3588\">Nilo Ilarde</a>&rsquo;s works literally chipping away at the accumulated residue of exhibition spaces, to the consistently whimsical approach to objects and site in the practice of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3390\">Juan Alcazaren</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3428\">Felix Bacolor</a>, to a devotedly naturalist strain in the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3436\">Genara Banzon</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3602\">Junyee</a>, and the folk motif-laden work of Roberto Feleo. A parallel development in this regard is the emergence of painting coupled with installative elements. This has surfaced in the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3459\">Annie Cabigting</a>, Jonathan Ching, Bembol dela Cruz, Nona Garcia, Lyra Garcellano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3596\">Geraldine Javier</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3777\">Yasmin Sison</a>, and Gerardo Tan, among other artists tracing their roots to conceptualism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Possibly among all extant fields of work, installation practice exhibits the most visible tendency in which artists no longer abide by the logic of merely one medium nor technique. Apart from developing in artists a more acute sense of space, material, and the contexts of engagement made possible in often immersive and multisensory encounters inclusive of performance, video, sound, and lately even taste and odor, installation continues to provide a symbolic respite for artists looking to move away from easy commoditization and containment. Over the last decades, practice in this vein has been done by artists such as Poklong Anading, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3404\">Alfredo and Isabel Aquilizan</a>, Datu Arellano, Martha Atienza, Yason Banal, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3441\">Joe Bautista</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3456\">Ringo Bunoan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3490\">Marina Cruz</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3497\">Kiri Dalena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3533\">Tad Ermita&ntilde;o</a>, Patricia Eustaquio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3573\">Katya Guerrero</a>, Jose Inocencio III, Nikki Luna, Lani Maestro, Manny Montelibano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3707\">Gary-Ross Pastrana</a>, Claro Ramirez, Juni Salvador, Maria Taniguchi, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3813\">Mac Valdezco</a>, Oscar Villamiel, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3841\">Eric Zamuco</a>, to name just a few. Senior artists such as Agnes Arellano, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3453\">Santiago Bose</a>, Roberto Chabet, Imelda Cajipe-Endaya, Jose Tence Ruiz, among others, have continued to practice with a keen spatial and semiotic sense, and have, over the years, influenced the work of younger practitioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Despite or perhaps because of the aggressive take-up of new media, a resiliently folk-privileging stream of work has gathered adherents among artists such as Leslie de Chavez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3584\">Riel Hilario</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3796\">Rodel Tapaya</a>. Their themes and work processes are variably informed by notions of craft and locus. Operating in hybrid secular-spiritual or metaphysical registers, their work also have affinities in various degrees with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2094\">assemblage</a>-installations and freestanding sculpture of Joel Alonday, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3577\">Renato Habulan</a>, Mark Justiniani, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3672\">Michael Mu&ntilde;oz</a>, Dan Raralio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3747\">Norberto Roldan</a>, Jose Tence Ruiz, Cristina Taniguchi, and Mark Valenzuela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Painting and sculpture of a visibly expressionist lineage have also been resolutely practiced since the rise to art world attention of the works of artists such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3496\">Danilo Dalena</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3507\">Jaime de Guzman</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3693\">Onib Olmedo</a>. This earlier generation gave rise to the 1990s strain of expressionist political critique evident in the early paintings of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3452\">Elmer Borlongan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3566\">Emmanuel Garibay</a>. A far-off but logical counterpart in sculpture may be seen in the work of Roedil Geraldo of Talisay, Negros Occidental, whose likely nearest influence is Black Artists in Asia&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3474\">Charlie Co</a>. Parallel to these developments too has been the emergence of an even newer generation of feminist artists circulating in expanding circles while still practicing in the orbit of the more senior founders of Kasibulan. Among these later-generation artists whose works range from installation, performance art, painting, photography, and film are artists such as Nana Buxani, Aba Dalena, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3632\">Racquel de Loyola</a>, Irma Lacorte, Lea Lim, Vivian Limpin, Aze Ong, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3725\">Alma Quinto</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3781\">Katti Sta. Ana</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The urgency and possibility of change partly unleashed in pre- to post-EDSA&rsquo;s fleetingly euphoric landscape also underlies much of the experimentation in context and form that has taken place. Such nascent undertakings would be realized in the slew of forward-looking galleries, institutions, and laboratory-type artist spaces, which rose and dissipated while enabling explorations that crossed divides defined along political and sometimes aesthetic alliances. Pinaglabanan, for instance, would have shows curated both by Chabet and Valenzuela at various junctures of the space&rsquo;s history; those reared in early A<span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">rt</span> <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">Lab</span> undertakings would cross over both into conceptual and SR-inclined initiatives. That these crossovers extended to succeeding generations of collectives, spaces, and individuals may be seen in the works of artists Anading and Kiri Dalena, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Just as they were dealing with the increasingly complex notions of what constituted art and what distinguishes Filipino culture, artists have also been tapping into both the formal and meaning-evocation potential of materials and physical and social processes. These may be discerned in the visceral decay and chemically breaking down of elements in the work of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3502\">Dick Daroy</a> and the collaged pop and art references strewn across the works of Nemo Aguila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3438\">Andres Barrioquinto</a>, Mariano Ching, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3512\">R.M. de Leon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3534\">Kiko Escora</a>, Dina Gadia, Epjay Pacheco, Jucar Raquepo, Clairelynn Uy, and the Ventura brothers Manok, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3817\">Ronald</a>, and Olan, alongside the punk sensibility present in the cheeky paintings and constructions of Louie Cordero, Robert Langenegger, Romeo Lee, Manuel Ocampo, Jayson Oliveria, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Broadening the Spheres of Visual Culture</b>. Artists today have crossed and transcended media categories, challenging traditional barriers created by curators and artists. Even as the more traditional modes of practices in painting and sculpture have persisted, they have also, in a sense, mutated in response to new materials, modes of work, and technology being explored and retooled by artists. And so, while there is still the strong homespun vignette flavor in the works of artists like Jecky Alano, Aba Dalena, Ral Arrogante, Michael Cacnio, Susanito Sarnate, and a hagiographic persuasion behind the sculpture of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3590\">Toym</a> and Juan Sajid Imao, one would also find these artists intermittently veering into relatively untried territory in relation to their own practices. One concrete instance of how the traditional craft of drawing is taken in an unexpected direction is in Renato Orara&rsquo;s <b><i>Library Bookworm</i></b> series where his drawings are surreptitiously done on the pages of books he then inserts or sites within libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Meanwhile, rapid technical advances that have become increasingly accessible to a greater number of artists and publics have also played into the shaping of work done in other fairly staple media like photography whose variably conceptual and documentary strains are evident in the works of artists such as Anading, Datu Arellano, Xyza Bacani, Juan Caguicla, Lena Cobangbang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4367\">Neil Daza</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3529\">Christina Dy</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3578\">Tommy Hafalla</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3679\">Wawi Navarroza</a>, Gina Osterloh, Paul Pfeiffer, Steve Tirona, VJ Villafranca, and MM Yu. On the other hand, time-, site-, and motion-sensitive media&mdash;like performance, video, sound, and digital interfaces&mdash;continue to find ways to coexist with lower-tech as well as more technologically sophisticated production. This broad and often unpredictable pairings and juxtapositions are demonstrated in the works of Anading, Pablo Biglang-Awa, Charles Buenconsejo, Cobangbang, Bunoan, Ermita&ntilde;o, Cocoy Lumbao, M.O.B. (Mail Order Bride), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3695\">Renan Ortiz</a>, Bong Ramilo, and Tito and Tita, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An illustrative case of an artist unselfconsciously crossing over into several media is the Baguio-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3751\">John Frank Sabado</a> whose early work consisted of intricately crafted painting and threaded assemblages heavily drawing from the indigenous textile-weaving motifs of the Cordilleras. His embarking on performance in the guise of his avatar, Eco-warrior, is indicative of the healthy restiveness that thrusts creative practice into other modes responsive to the production context in which an artist moves within. It also demonstrates how artists who are identified advocates of traditional practices are not held back from changing the pace and method in their own work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The notion of art exclusively being the sphere for the trained is one of the most challenged ideas of this period. This has certainly been aided by the onset of more accessible imaging technology from digital online platforms and parallel photography/graphic manipulation app portals, alongside widened circulation circuits. Populist-oriented social media applications have, for instance, allowed the rise of tech-savvy segments of the population who not only explore the use of these new creative tools but also short-circuit channels that guard the art world and/or make new art worlds freed from critical restraint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This relatively autonomous do-it-yourself impulse appears to be behind such initiatives as a recent Bacolod-based sidewalk intervention done by Jose Inocencio III across the Negros Museum during the 2015 VIVA ExCon. This stream runs strongly too in the work of the Negros-based collectives Temple of the Kings and Syano, as well as in the work of the Cagayan de Oro-based Siete Pesos collective, and still other Mindanao-based artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3382\">Ib&rsquo;n Salipyasin Ahmad</a>, Rosalie Zerrudo, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Whereas most art schools/academies in the Philippines are still organized through the logic of single-form majors, like studio inclusive of painting, sculpture, etc., and visual communication alternately called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2093\">advertising</a>, a core of newer schools have sprung up since. Decidedly gone multimedia if not transmedia, these schools have also opened up fairly new art management/curatorial programs where both potential artists, curators, and cultural workers receive institutional training as well as input from professional artists, programmers, etc. This rise of transmedia and interdisciplinary school and post-school platforms is prefaced by a continually evolving landscape of practice, which includes guild-type or workshop-collaborative learning models that nurtured the career of those from Salakai in the 1990s, and artist-workers of Broke in the 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Much more recently in this last decade, a discursive and later termed as research-based strain of art practice would surface in various platforms. This non-spectacle, process-based, and performative stream could be seen as displaying affinities with conceptual work of artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3775\">Judy Freya Sibayan</a>. The more logical antecedents are her projects such as the mobile and body-scaled <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2293\"><strong>Scapular Gallery Nomad</strong></a></strong> </i></b> and the <b><i>Museum of Mental Objects</i></b>, a conceptual archive of ideas peer-accessioned by mostly artists associated with Sibayan. This moving away from the making of objects as primary output, the self-directed research-based work that even has avowedly anti-object strain, presently manifests in archiving, workshops, radio broadcasts, talks, screenings, and performances. While still in a nascent stage, this proposed foil to wholesale co-optation by market mechanisms is still largely under-theorized and more commonly construed as public programming or art education rather than creative practice. Nevertheless, among the schooled visual artists who have taken to this vein is Calubayan who has mined a personal engagement with psychotherapy to research and embody the knowledge-accretion process behind what artists do in what appears to be a lifelong performance. In contrast to this inwardly directed impetus of practice is the interventionist and/or participatory/community-oriented work undertaken by W.A.L.A., and other urban collectives who have resorted to a range of modes from one-off occupations of sites, to more socially immersive engagements with disadvantaged social sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As can be gleaned from this survey, emergent initiatives often consist of productions of composite works invoking old-new subjects, employing traditional as well as repurposed and new materials, and/or low and cutting-edge technology as artists look at what is on hand in their effort to reconfigure the parameters of their practices and sites in which they may choose to make and circulate their work. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Maria Eileen Legaspi-Ramirez and Helen Yu-Rivera</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"related\" name=\"related\"></a>Related Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2121\" target=\"_self\">Medium and Materials of Art</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2122\" target=\"_self\">Knowledge and Discourse of Art</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2123\" target=\"_self\">Modes of Validation</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/16/2124\" target=\"_self\">Initiatives and Engagements</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2103\" target=\"_self\">Installation and Site-Specific Art</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\" target=\"_self\">Multimedia</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2111\" target=\"_self\">Performance Art</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2113\" target=\"_self\">Photography</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2117\" target=\"_self\">Sound Art</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2120\" target=\"_self\">Video Art</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"sources\" name=\"sources\"></a>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Bastards of Misrepresentation. 2015.

				"value": "The post-Marcos political euphoria of the mid-1980s revolved around two poles. First, there was a populist turn manifested in an aversion to state intervention in culture as this was feared to be too associated with the excesses of the deposed regime. Second, there was a growing faith in the capacity of participatory and grassroots-led governance as foil to the centralized mode of cultural management that prevailed through the Marcos years. The consequent aspiration toward a dispersion of power away from the national cultural centers in Manila was proposed as a way to shift the focus from perceptibly elite, National Capital Region-centric art toward emergent local modes of art engagement cognizant of social and area-based nuances."

Rather than enabling the imaginative capacity of Filipinos to creatively engage with complex questions about identity, development, and change, Marcos&#x2019;s cultural managers were perceived by the larger public as merely perpetuating the status of the already privileged. Marcos also had a virtual stranglehold over official narrative-generating institutions such as the <a href=\"/3/3/3676\">National Museum of the Philippines</a>, the <a href=\"/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, the Metropolitan Museum of Manila, the Museum of Philippine Art, Design Center of the Philippines, the Manila Film Center, state-controlled tri-media, and even the physical architecture that would hold up a fabricated image of the New Society."

The unarticulated myth that underlay post-EDSA public perception was that the Aquino government could work on a fresh, clean slate. The consequent power vacuum brought on by appointees of the past regime yielding their posts occasioned a radical changing of the guard. This new set of cultural administrators and gatekeepers set out to craft a new macrovision of how culture and power should interface. Whereas before they were shutout artists, cultural workers, and intellectuals, they became cultural administrators who advocated a pluralist and multivocal notion of art production and circulation."

In 1998, Ramos initiated the creation of a National Museum Complex where the Finance and the Department of Tourism Buildings were to be used by the National Museum. First Lady Amelita &#x201C;Ming&#x201D; Ramos was also active in the art scene, working with Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim in the reconstruction of the Metropolitan Museum.

In 2009, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo named five artists as recipients of the National Artist awards. These artists were not in the list of the original candidates submitted by the selection committee composed of members from the NCCA and the CCP, which outraged civilians and artists. In the same year, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court by National Artists <a href=\"/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a> and <a href=\"/9/9/5033\">Virgilio Almario</a> to prevent Malaca&#xF1;an from conferring the award to these artists.

It generated so much controversy that the CCP had to close down the exhibit due to &#x201C;vandalism and threats to its persons&#x201D; (<i>GMA News Online</i> 2011). A case was filed against Cruz and CCP officials by lawyer Manuel Dayrit of the Kapatiran party list accusing them of violating Article 201 of the Revised Penal Code on obscene exhibitions and indecent shows. In 2013, the Office of the Ombudsman ruled that <b><i>Poleteismo </i></b>did not fall under &#x201C;obscene&#x201D; exhibitions. It further added that the work was not &#x201C;lacking in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value as to remove it from the ambit of constitutionally protected expression&#x201D; (Office of the Ombudsman 2013)."

The Philippine Art Venice Biennale was a collaborative project of the NCCA, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Office of Senator <a href=\"/8/69/4882\">Loren Legarda</a>. In the midst of the resurgence of the presence of Philippine art in various global platforms, the articulation of the shifting meaning of the Filipino experience in the local, national, and diasporic contexts has defined the production, circulation, and reception of art."

One of the most important tasks at hand after EDSA 1 was the dismantling of the earlier image of state-run institutions, like the Cultural Center of the Philippines, as elitist. Right after assuming the presidency, Corazon Aquino appointed Ma. Teresita Roxas as president of the CCP and <a href=\"/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a> as artistic director. Together with several artists and cultural workers, Tiongson then set out to draft the five thrusts that would guide the reorientation of the CCP. The five thrusts were Filipinization, democratization, decentralization, promotion of artistic excellence, and reorientation of international exchanges (Tiongson 2009). The new administrators sought to open the doors of the CCP to artists and audiences of all classes, inviting them in from peripheral regions. Filipinization was at the core of these changes and the new CCP worked to actively support Filipino artists and their works and to promote them not only locally but in other countries as well."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "When the new team took over the CCP on 15 Jul 1986, a series of consultations were held to hear the voices of past administrative officers and artistic directors of the CCP and artists. These consultations led to the implementation of changes such as the restructuring of the CCP into a National Coordinating Center for the Arts. This move led to the opening of the CCP to artists who were marginalized during the Marcos regime, such as the social realists, singers like the <a href=\"/5/42/4116\">Patatag</a>, and theater groups like the <a href=\"/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a> (Tiongson 2009). The CCP Board was also reconstituted to accommodate not only government appointees and those from the business sector but also artists such as <a href=\"/7/7/2960\">CB Garrucho</a>, <a href=\"/6/6/2480\">Cora I&#xF1;igo</a>, <a href=\"/5/42/3992\">Erlinda Fule</a>, <a href=\"/2/2/2693\">Rodrigo Perez III</a>, <a href=\"/2/2/2670\">Leandro Locsin</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3846\">Jaime Zobel</a>, Oscar Ledesma, and Manolo Agustines. The CCP also invited the <a href=\"/6/51/2564\">Ramon Obusan Folkloric Group</a> and the University of Santo Tomas Symphony Orchestra to join the expanding resident companies. In the spirit of democratization, the CCP became open to all art styles and legitimized popular art and showcased them through exhibitions such as <a href=\"/3/17/3815\">Tony Velasquez</a>&#x2019;s <i><a href=\"/9/73/1554\">komiks</a> <b><a href=\"/9/77/1760\"><strong>Kenkoy</strong></a></b></i>; programs such as the open-air Seranata ng mga Banda, featuring local bass bands; and symposia, screenings, and publications of popular films. In its attempt to evolve from its static elitist position to an active democratic institution, the CCP reached out not only to artists but to Filipino audiences across sectors. This was done by bringing resident companies to perform in venues outside Metro Manila and busing high school students in to watch plays and movies in the CCP."

				"value": "One of the most significant contributions of the CCP during this era was the reorganization of its outreach and exchange department. In its thrust toward decentralization, art councils were formed in cities outside Metro Manila that would be responsible for &#x201C;gathering local visual, performing and literary artists into an organization that would take care of developing and supporting their own original productions according to the priorities and plans that they would identify and pursue for themselves.&#x201D; These art councils received in-service training in arts management from the CCP in order to create viable and sustainable programs. These councils also received grants from the CCP to train their artists and to encourage them to produce original works of art showcasing their local culture. Art festivals were held in the regions rather than in Manila. Aside from giving grants, the CCP also helped local artists raise funds for their projects by bringing performers, artwork and film exhibitions to their locales."

				"value": "The thrust on Filipinization was concretized by programs ensuring that Filipino artists would benefit from foreign artists invited to the center. Workshops, performances, master classes, artist exchanges, and residencies were organized through funding actively sourced from embassies and patrons. In 1988, the Museo ng Kalinangang Filipino (Museum of Philippine Culture) was opened to showcase a thematic exhibit based on the Filipino concept of <i>diwa</i> (consciousness) utilizing Philippine ethnographic <a href=\"/3/16/2121\">materials</a> to highlight the integration of art, aesthetics, and everyday life. In 1994, the publication of the 10 volumes of the <b><i>Encyclopedia of Philippine Art</i></b>, together with the monographs and video productions of <b><i>Tuklas Sining </i></b>(Discovering Art),<b><i> </i></b>helped in promoting Philippine art and culture to a wider public."

Francisco</a>. CCP instituted venue grants to visual artists to showcase their work wherein various spaces of the building also became exhibit spaces. The corridors at the second, third, and fourth floors became Pasilyo <a href=\"/3/17/3648\">Vicente Manansala</a>, Pasilyo <a href=\"/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a>, and Pasilyo <a href=\"/3/17/3530\">Victorio Edades</a>, respectively.

				"value": "By the late 1990s, the cultural development fund would dwindle and reach a critical level, necessitating the succeeding administrations to augment it by lobbying for increases in the annual budget from the government, raising funds through corporate sponsorship and cost-cutting measures (CCP 1999, 4-6). Other problems faced by the succeeding administrators included the deterioration of the physical structure of the CCP Complex. In 1999, a plan was drafted for the development of half of the 60-hectare CCP Complex for commercial purposes to help fund the institution&#x2019;s artistic ventures and projects. By 2004, the CCP had implemented various public relations projects, among them the publication of the <b><i>CCP News Bulletin</i></b>, the adoption of a new corporate logo, the publication of &#x201C;high-impact&#x201D; feature articles in print media, and the establishment of tri-media networking in the regions (CCP 2004). In 2005, the CCP expanded its focus in response to globalization and the opening of world markets. To address the danger of cultural invasion by more powerful and dominant cultures, the CCP formulated a national plan to develop and promote micro, small, and medium artistic and cultural enterprises. Projects were geared toward supporting artists and groups, encouraging them to develop viable and sustainable operations (CCP 2005). The CCP also geared its performances, festivals, cultural events, exhibitions, film showings, and dialogues to reach Filipinos in other countries."

Before the initial euphoria of EDSA waned, members of the <a href=\"/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a> convened to draft a comprehensive blueprint for the creation of a Ministry of Culture. Aquino&#x2019;s response to this call was the creation of the PCCA through Executive Order 118. It was not until 1992 that this executive order was enacted into law creating the National Commission for Culture and the Arts through Republic Act 7356. The NCCA acts as an umbrella organization enacting policies, coordinating and disbursing grants &#x201C;for the promotion of Philippine Arts and Culture,&#x201D; and administering the National Endowment Fund for Culture. Executive Order 80 placed the CCP, the National Historical Institute, the National Museum, the National Library, and the Records, Management and Archives Office under the NCCA.

The reconstituted NCCA institutionalized its core of artist-volunteers as national committee members, such as <a href=\"/3/17/3600\">Jose Joya</a> and <a href=\"/3/17/3643\">Mauro Malang</a>, to give these individuals a way to evolve policy and programs from the ground up. Sitting on these committees were pools of artists and cultural workers who were expected to serve as expert voices to feed into how administrators and bureaucrats would logistically oversee a pioneering cultural endowment fund. This endowment fund was gained primarily from a fraction of travel taxes and proceeds from the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation."

The expectation was that both non-aligned individuals and organizations would have a level playing field within which to compete for monies that could help realize projects that might not find patronage elsewhere. However, it would not take too long after the fervor of the 1986 EDSA Revolt for this to wane. Alongside the limited means to accommodate all competing interests, the initial optimism became weighed down by several factors. The uneven capacities of artists and artists&#x2019; organizations to navigate the intricacies of grant administration, the incompatibility between the working processes of government and creative agents, and the narrow dissemination of information about opportunities for artists were some of the hindrances faced by artists. These eventually led to the slowing down of communication and decision-making. Some disenfranchised sectors were ambivalent toward state mechanisms, which they perceived as disadvantaging practices that did not easily fall within prescribed tropes such as identity, authenticity, and representative culture. Some also perceived that government programming had become precariously more market-oriented."

Despite the meager budget allocated for the National Museum in 1986, the museum managed to make modest improvements in their collection, research projects, and branch museums development (National Museum 1986). The Archaeology Division of the National Museum was created in 1988 to conduct researches on prehistory and protohistory of the Philippines through archaeological excavations of land and water sites (National Museum 1986). In the mid-1990s, President Fidel V. Ramos initiated the creation of a National Museum Complex where the Finance and the Department of Tourism (DOT) Buildings were to be turned over for use by the National Museum. The Finance Building was turned over in 1995 and with the transfer of the Senate to Quezon City, the Executive House was also incorporated into the National Museum Complex. Upon the approval of Republic Act 8492 (National Museum Act of 1998) on 12 Feb 1998, the National Museum was reestablished as &#x201C;an autonomous government trust instrumentality under a Board of Trustees &#x2026; which designated the President of the Philippines as the Honorary Chairman and Patron of the National Museum&#x201D; (<i>Official Gazette</i> 2016). Also in 1998, the Museum of the Filipino People in the converted Finance Building was inaugurated, featuring ethnographic materials and interactive modules. In 2013, plans were under way to turn the DOT Building into the Museum of Natural History. As a repository of the Philippines&#x2019; natural and cultural heritage, the National Museum has continued to strengthen its collections in the succeeding decades after EDSA 1. The National Museum also continues to undertake researches, exhibitions, projects, and programs in the fields of natural science, social science, culture, and the arts."

Aside from having regular exhibitions of Philippine arts, the MET refined their objectives to include the appreciation of arts of the everyday, expansion of viewership, acquisition of art references from other countries for the appreciation of the Filipino audience, and upgrading of its services and administration (Paulino 2005, 36-7). The museum also featured a bilingual, didactic approach in its first post-EDSA exhibition. Instructional materials, such as signages, guide notes, teachers&#x2019; museum assistants, and monographs, were written in both English and Filipino (Paulino 2005, 37). To further Filipinize the museum&#x2019;s image, <a href=\"/3/3/3782\">Felice Sta. Maria</a>, then director of the MET, conceptualized the brown banig (reed woven mats) as opposed to the sterile, elitist, and Western concept of the museum as a white cube. Using the Filipinos&#x2019; affinity with colors, the museum walls were sometimes painted and &#x201C;academic labels were formulated into poetic thought pockets which were trite but high impact&#x201D; (Paulino 2005, 37). The fluid spaces were filled with more materials and the once silent halls were now jarred by piped-in music. What made MET different from the other museums at this time was its focus on the institution as a nonformal space for continuing learning and value formation (Paulino 2005, 37). The MET offered museum apprenticeship for students, volunteer programs for professionals, and traveling exhibits. In the 1990s, it was mired by controversy when rumors spread that the <a href=\"/3/3/3435\">Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)</a> was to evict the MET and sell its collections. Many artists and cultural workers rallied behind the MET, arguing that it was an important institution that provided spaces for artists to exhibit their works. The controversy died down when the BSP dispelled rumors of the museum&#x2019;s eviction. President Fidel V. Ramos also intervened and ordered Secretary Teofisto Guingona Jr, First Lady Amelita Ramos, and Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim to assist the MET. A newly renovated MET was then inaugurated in 1994. In the 2000s, MET director <a href=\"/9/9/5484\">Victorino Manalo</a> conceptualized a fluid connection between museums and communities through its four-year program Sining at Pamayanan (Paulino 2005, 42-3). This concept was applied in <b><i>Quiapo: The Arts of a City District</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>which showcased not only the arts of Quiapo but problems such as overpopulation. With this focus, the MET tapped art as a resource and source of insight to societal issues and problems, &#x201C;thus revitalizing the museum as useful to a broader audience&#x201D; (Manalo in Paulino 2005, 43)."

Fewer than 10 galleries were active in the early years of the Aquino administration, among which were La Galerie of Alliance Fran&#xE7;aise, Madrigal Center, West Gallery, and Brix Gallery (Yusi 2016). The scant number of galleries was attributed to the economic problems that beset the early years of the Aquino administration. The gallery scene began to pick up again in the 1990s when the economy started recovering from its initial slump. The early 1990s saw the opening of Art Walks and galleries in malls, which came about after the successful art show of <a href=\"/3/17/3762\">Juvenal Sanso</a> in SM Megamall (Yusi 2016). With the successful sale of Sanso&#x2019;s artworks not only to collectors but also to casual passersby, SM&#x2019;s administration thought it was possible to bring art closer to the public (Yusi 2016). They then transformed level 4 of the SM Megamall as an Art Walk, housing galleries and exhibition spaces. This success was followed later by new galleries in Shangri-La Plaza, Alabang Town Center, and Glorietta 4. In the 1990s, Cubao Expo in Quezon City, which used to be the Marikina Shoe Expo, attracted artists and business people to open galleries and art shops due to the low rent. Due to rental increases in the following decades, only a few galleries have survived in this area today (Yusi 2016). In 2006, Pasong Tamo (now Don Chino Roces Ave) in Makati was transformed from a business district, mostly consisting of car garage shops, to a creative district of galleries, furniture shops, and advertising agencies (del Rosario 2016)."

Rather than tending established modern artists, commercial galleries opted to support contemporary work, which would later become the staples of the current mainstream gallery circuit. These include Contreras Sculpture, Crucible Gallery, Finale Art File, Galeria de las Islas, Galeria Duemila, Gallery Genesis, Liongoren Art Gallery, Madrigal Art Center, among others.

Meanwhile, older formations&#x2014;such as the <a href=\"/3/17/3415\">Art Association of the Philippines</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3449\">Black Artists in Asia</a>, Concerned Artists of the Philippines, <a href=\"/3/3/3605\"><em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Kababaihan</span></em> sa Sining at Bagong Sibol na Kamalayan</a>, Pampanga Arts Guild, the Saturday Group of Artists&#x2014;and other media-based, advocacy-driven, art school-born groupings, like Angono Ateliers Association and Junior Ateliers, <a href=\"/7/7/2741\">Anino Shadowplay</a>, Anting-Anting&#xA0;Artists&#x2019; Circle, Grupong ANG, Hulo, New World Disorder, Printmakers Association of the Philippines, Salingpusa (then <a href=\"/3/17/3761\">Sanggawa</a>), Society of Philippine Sculptors, TAMA, Tutok, <a href=\"/3/3/3809\">UGATLahi</a>, among many others, would persevere or hibernate within an increasingly crowded field."

An example is Filipino-American filmmaker Angel Shaw&#x2019;s 2014 project, <b><i>Markets of Resistance: A Visual and Interdisciplinary Trade-Barter Exhibition</i></b>, which consisted of intrepid installations and performances and the occupation of market stalls in Baguio City&#x2019;s public market. In this event, artists were asked to make objects that could be bartered in kind where no money was exchanged. The exhibition decentralized market forces by resituating Baguio as a precolonial site where barter trade was practiced and by bringing the works of artists to the general public. The event or show was meant as a process of &#x201C;connecting people and ideas rather than of producing&#x201D; (de Veyra 2015)."

For example, visual artists seek employment as animators for global entertainment companies abroad. However, the thriving of popular movements and developmental NGOs able to reach communities without rigid protocols and beyond traditional political centers provided momentum to artist-initiated and community-run spaces and cultural initiatives.

Thus the privileging of identity discourse as a theme, which firmly took hold after World War II, has mellowed and given way to more vibrant formulations of what constitutes Filipino creativity, relevant content, and viable creative space. What has become increasingly evident in the work of younger artists is the veering toward a more globalized thematic. This stands in contrast to the much more introspective stream of the 1980s and partially of the 1990s. Partly due to the ease in which information now travels digitally, artists and organizers have taken on post-identity questions that range from notions of global citizenship, queries on migration, climate change, and consumerism, which are shared across many national sites. Artists also tap digital platforms to present their work and explore alternate modes of producing art, which also make possible interfaces with those beyond Philippine borders."

As for the NCCA, increasing privileging of ethnolinguistic programming under the present leadership has been behind the annual Dayaw festivals, and where even the NCCA&#x2019;s annual Philippine art festivals have emphasized the trope of indigeneity.

The mid-1980s saw the realigning of political borders in Europe&#x2019;s post-Cold War environs and the contingent wearing away of long-running dictatorships in postcolonial governments in Asia and Latin America. Alongside this phenomenon was the reshaping of histories and their production. Virtually throughout the Asian region, the shared project of many local scholars became the writing of more contextualized accounts of their own modernities and contemporaneities, and the writing back of evidences of precolonial culture into their own histories amidst imperial impositions from within Asia itself and/or Euro-America. This instinctive recourse to a self-determined present and prouder past would slowly gain ground and become institutionalized through area studies as well as interdisciplinary courses in various universities and research centers."

The increasingly professionalized infrastructure of the gallery system made competitive with the influx of foreign dealers and gallerists pursuing Filipino artists has also spurred the more consistent publication of catalogues both for local and art fair-bound showings.

Simultaneously, adherents of more classical and traditional practice continue to produce work that may or may not easily get enfolded into the market and contemporary discourse. In general, however, artists who receive attention are those who more readily find recourse in pastiche or appropriation by weaving together discrepant motifs, toning down singular authorship, and occasionally refusing to deal with historicization by resorting to iconoclasm, parody, and irony. The broad range of work produced runs the gamut of the patronizingly representative, the frankly didactic, to the loosely woven together pop and folk culture references posed as diatribes against mainstream thought systems."

The compacted formats and speeds at which information has become available through Web 2.0 and higher enable not just the production of alternate discourse but also the making and circulating of artistic work in modes previously known to and within reach of only a few. The emergence of memes, zines, <a href=\"/3/15/2117\">sound work</a>, <a href=\"/3/15/2120\">video</a>, <a href=\"/3/15/2113\">photography</a>, and bantering among artists and thinkers via the informal and sometimes clandestine chatter over portable media like pirate radio and social network platforms extends the possibilities of self-curation and building up of contact circles. Works in these forms also spread through wider circuits that are increasingly cheaper to work with and transmit through. This is done by activating physical and virtual spaces through paralegal or bootleg occupations of sites, the making of sound environments, performance, and video art that may or may not be crowdsourced. More importantly, these newer modes of making and encountering art occasion a comparatively more participatory counterflow of ideas. These channels facilitate interaction, even sometimes enabling more frequent physical and virtual homecomings or reintroductions of Filipino artists previously less visible to local art publics. One clear-cut case is <a href=\"/3/17/3658\">David Medalla</a>&#x2019;s London Biennale extending satellite presences in other continents where Filipino and non-Filipino artists have chosen to respond to his mega art spectacle."

This development, and the emergence of more active and aggressive artist-curators, also patently broadens the democratic space for practice that does not always readily fit into categories set by academe and other cultural institutions with specific agendas. One-off, transient online platforms as modes of making sites of art practice have, for instance, made possible a more organic though not always unproblematic fusing of the work of artists from various fields such as design, music, dance, theater, film, visual art, etc. Illustrative of this stream is the annual experimental sound art initiative called WSK, organized by Merv Espina with Tengal Drilon, who is also behind more project-based/event initiatives like SABAW Media Kitchen and Terminal Garden. Parallel to this is the Art in the Park pop-up mode already appropriated by real estate promoters who have been insinuating art into community programming through periodic events, including affordable art fairs. Reminiscent of the exploration in terms of space that occurred in the 1970s, other loosely-configured, multimedia, multisite, and avowedly public interventions have also been done by AXIS Baguio, Back to Square 1&#x2019;s Off Site / Out of Sight, Neo-Angono&#x2019;s annual public art festivals, 98B through its team-up with the Escolta commercial association, Windang Aesthetics Labor Army (W.A.L.A.) via the multi-collective Botcha squat occupations, and the several installments of the Bagasbas and Malasimbo festivals. As a whole, being able to take on the tasks of scripting and organizing have allowed artists themselves to craft their own narratives. Some artists even propose clashing stories about their own trajectories in relation to larger questions on art and culture."

Exhibition platforms, whether brick or mortar or virtual, saw a rise of the occasional cross-regional exhibition platforms in fairs or private gallery settings, outpacing the need for art writing and criticism. One major difference between the 1990s and more recent decades is the lack of museum-scale displays of international art in the Philippines. These displays were previously made possible by organizations such as the Japan Foundation and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which aggressively organized exchanges in the 1990s."

On other interstate institutional fronts, exchanges and conferences would be enabled by the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information, Asia Society, the Australian Artists&#x2019; Regional Exchange, Southeast Asian Studies Regional Exchange Program, and later by other international windows like the Alliance Fran&#xE7;aise Philippines networking-residency programs, Asian Cultural Council, and the Asian Public Intellectuals Fellowship of the Nippon Foundation. These meant an increased exposure and visibility for Philippine art alongside the heightened representation of Filipinos in the seminal Fukuoka Asian Art Shows, which evolved into the Fukuoka Triennale, and the Queensland Art Gallery&#x2019;s Asia-Pacific Triennials prior to the proliferation of biennales across the world. Through the decades, Filipino artists would be traveling out to key international events&#x2014;such as the biennales in Havana, Melbourne, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Yokohama, and Documenta, among others&#x2014;as official Philippine representatives or as artists working out from their present countries of residence. The escalating importance of Asia-based platforms, such as those in Dhaka, Gwangju, Jakarta, Shanghai, Singapore, and Taipei, would subsequently serve to counterpoint the high-profile regional art fairs and local/international art auctions that now powerfully play into the trading and making of reputations of artists from the region. After a hiatus of 50 years, the Philippines returned to participate in the oldest perennial, the 2015 Venice Biennale, with a team made up of Patrick Flores, <a href=\"/3/17/3668\">Manny Montelibano</a>, and Jose Tence Ruiz under a curatorial platform <b><i>Tie a String around the World</i></b>, which plays up a reverse imperial trajectory in the Asian incursion into Europe of the Mongol military leader Genghis Khan."

The generally unstructured international exchange-residencies that have been undertaken through collectives, like 98B, Project Space Pilipinas, and Neo-Angono, have been generally sustained thus far. Meanwhile in the performance art circuit, the launching of international festivals beginning in the 1990s onward triggered a resurgence of performative work initially within high-traffic public spaces like Luneta and Malate, then later on taking festival content through the university circuit, and on the road through Philippine provinces and cities like Lipa, Batangas, Lingayen, Pangasinan, and Santiago, Isabela. These gestures of occupation of new spaces of production, reception, and circulation, which not only characterize work in performance but also in transmedia, might prove to be what distinguish this period from preceding robust developmental phases of Philippine art."

And because of how inescapably tied up in culture change this idea of self and subjectivities was turning into, both artists and theorists caution against rigid pronouncements anchored on notions of racial purity and clear-cut territorial affinities. One such key example of this stream would be the series of exhibitions undertaken in Europe, Asia, and North America by the loose group of artists making up the Bastards of Misrepresentation, which include <a href=\"/3/3/3398\">Poklong Anading</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3434\">Yason Banal</a>, Argie Bandoy, Bea Camacho, <a href=\"/3/17/3475\">Lena Cobangbang</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3484\">Louie Cordero</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3489\">Maria Cruz</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3498\">Gaston Damag</a>, Arvin Flores, Dina Gadia, <a href=\"/3/17/3610\">Robert Langenegger</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3617\">Romeo Lee</a>, Pow Martinez, Manuel Ocampo, <a href=\"/3/3/3692\">Jayson Oliveria</a>, Carlo Ricafort, Gerardo Tan, <a href=\"/3/17/3834\">MM Yu</a>, and Zoleta.

One concrete example of this is the work of Filipino-American Stephanie Syjuco, <b><i>Empire Garden</i></b>, 2015, where her live botanical rendering of the history of empire comes together in the form of an ongoing makeshift laboratory project that hopes to grow tobacco, cotton, indigo, poppy, and corn under artificial conditions. As more works get produced by artists of Filipino ancestry who live as transients or as dual citizens and thus may possess more than singular loyalties to any one country, questions of stake and patrimonial anchors have become more and more complicated and laborious to reconcile."

Two winning pieces from the Philippine Art Awards help illustrate at least two approaches artists have adopted within the realm of figurative painting. First off is <a href=\"/3/3/3536\">Alfredo Esquillo</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>Daang Ligid-Krus</i></b>, 1996, which demonstrates classical painting technique on what was then a novel painting ground of rubber. The work is a deft rendering of extremely lifelike details in a scene of folk religious devotees making their way through a devotional route laid out in maze configuration, which could be read as souls navigating predetermined paths even when counting on the existence of options. Specific points in the maze are punctuated by iconic folk motifs like town musicians, indigenized and infantilized Christ image, amulets, and other devotional instruments amidst secular devices like live TV sets, drink, and porn. Esquillo&#x2019;s is a type of image-making that draws heavily from local references even as its narrative is not straightforwardly as prescriptive or moralistic as visual materials in school used to be mandated. This anecdotal slice is arguably open that multiple readings could be made around and about it. The second piece for consideration is <a href=\"/3/17/3562\">Nona Garcia</a>&#x2019;s <b><i>See Saw</i></b>, 2000, which is indicative of how most Filipino artists remain preoccupied with draughtmanship&#x2014;in this case, down to the creases, even as this work is coupled with an interest in addressing the realization that the most &#x201C;real&#x201D; of images are subject to the complexities of truth telling. <b><i>See Saw</i></b> is both verbal and visual pun, where the seen and unseen are dually questioned given that the painting of a chainsaw, however delicately bundled up and thus hidden, is remarkably realistic whereas the unwrapped chainsaw subjected to the piercing radiographic lenses of an X-ray machine is rendered visible but also almost unreal because of its being visually mediated through another layer of vision."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "While demonstrating the kind of hyperrealist strain of image-making that continues to be popular among many Filipinos, these artists&#x2019; image-making practices also still do demonstrate the polarities in thinking about what is and what could be, and how mimesis or verisimilitude can or cannot be the be-all and end-all of seeing and knowing. The shock aesthetic that overlays the work of artists such as <a href=\"/3/17/3619\">Jose Legaspi</a> with his representations of homoerotic trauma, for instance, strongly challenges the inherently traditional association that hyperrealist painting has earned. Another work that hews to a graphic-conceptualist vein is <a href=\"/3/17/3519\">Antipas Delotavo</a>&#x2019;s centennial mural <b><i>Dantaon</i></b>, 1998, which not only readily registers as a Philippine history narrative but also poses a conceptual challenge to the traditional view of history as tightly bound up through events and one-dimensional personages constructed by the writing of historians and the interventions of media and popular reading. The deliberately unfinished progression of characters and motion sequence illustrates how the visual communicates through both the cognitive and affective senses. Lastly, another demonstration of how figuration can be construed more conceptually is <a href=\"/3/17/3639\">Lani Maestro</a>&#x2019;s drawings of body parts for her installation <b><i>Poem without a Country</i></b>, 1988, done in reference to human rights abuses perpetuated even during post-EDSA regimes. Just as in another piece, <b><i>A Wound in the Lung</i></b>, 1994, a room-size installation of a mound of soil within which a human-scale cavity was left, Maestro&#x2019;s desire to engage with arguably humanist themes is rendered in the work subtly to perhaps not just resonate with narrowed local context like Philippine militarization but also to effect conversations with other visual cultures that may have affinities in experience, but not with such locally recognizable references."

				"value": "Nonetheless, a more straightforwardly identitarian mode is still operative for other artists. In the case of National Artist BenCab, for instance, in regard to his already politically charged installments of the Sabel<b><i> </i></b>series, the female figurative motif has become more and more associated with a universalized reference to either a maternal icon for nation, or as stand-in for the everyday woman in swirling turn-of-the-century dress overlaid with plastic wrap. A more complicated position taken in regard to issues of subject and representation may be found in the work of Gaston Damag whose backhanded imaging of his roots in Banaue takes form in violence-laden vignettes of the <b>bulol</b> physically subjected to pressure and wearing down in exhibitionary contexts. This is in contrast to a predilection for nostalgically referring to a &#x201C;purer&#x201D; past seen in the practice of the de Guia brothers&#x2014;Kidlat Jr in his photographic images of a rapidly transforming mountain city, Kabunian&#x2019;s lowbrow aesthetic realized in collaborative and publicly sited mosaics, and <a href=\"/3/3/3506\">Kawayan</a>&#x2019;s more urbane found object critique of globalizing influences trudging upon everyday Filipino consciousness."

Consequently, resistant strains have taken a broad range of forms and have unevenly been underpinned by theory and critique&#x2014;with some work often coming across as knee-jerk impulse pushing artists to play anywhere between the continuum of aimless truant to sharp critic."

This is seen in differing degrees in the wide range of performative work of David Medalla, to the dour alter egos <a href=\"/3/17/3558\">Lyra Garcellano</a> crafts in her print and online comic strips.

Operating in hybrid secular-spiritual or metaphysical registers, their work also have affinities in various degrees with the <a href=\"/3/15/2094\">assemblage</a>-installations and freestanding sculpture of Joel Alonday, <a href=\"/3/17/3577\">Renato Habulan</a>, Mark Justiniani, <a href=\"/3/3/3672\">Michael Mu&#xF1;oz</a>, Dan Raralio, <a href=\"/3/17/3747\">Norberto Roldan</a>, Jose Tence Ruiz, Cristina Taniguchi, and Mark Valenzuela."

This earlier generation gave rise to the 1990s strain of expressionist political critique evident in the early paintings of <a href=\"/3/17/3452\">Elmer Borlongan</a> and <a href=\"/3/17/3566\">Emmanuel Garibay</a>. A far-off but logical counterpart in sculpture may be seen in the work of Roedil Geraldo of Talisay, Negros Occidental, whose likely nearest influence is Black Artists in Asia&#x2019;s <a href=\"/3/17/3474\">Charlie Co</a>. Parallel to these developments too has been the emergence of an even newer generation of feminist artists circulating in expanding circles while still practicing in the orbit of the more senior founders of Kasibulan. Among these later-generation artists whose works range from installation, performance art, painting, photography, and film are artists such as Nana Buxani, Aba Dalena, <a href=\"/3/3/3632\">Racquel de Loyola</a>, Irma Lacorte, Lea Lim, Vivian Limpin, Aze Ong, <a href=\"/3/17/3725\">Alma Quinto</a>, and <a href=\"/3/3/3781\">Katti Sta.

Such nascent undertakings would be realized in the slew of forward-looking galleries, institutions, and laboratory-type artist spaces, which rose and dissipated while enabling explorations that crossed divides defined along political and sometimes aesthetic alliances. Pinaglabanan, for instance, would have shows curated both by Chabet and Valenzuela at various junctures of the space&#x2019;s history; those reared in early A<span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">rt</span> <span style=\"text-transform:uppercase\">Lab</span> undertakings would cross over both into conceptual and SR-inclined initiatives.

These may be discerned in the visceral decay and chemically breaking down of elements in the work of <a href=\"/3/3/3502\">Dick Daroy</a> and the collaged pop and art references strewn across the works of Nemo Aguila, <a href=\"/3/17/3438\">Andres Barrioquinto</a>, Mariano Ching, <a href=\"/3/3/3512\">R.M. de Leon</a>, <a href=\"/3/3/3534\">Kiko Escora</a>, Dina Gadia, Epjay Pacheco, Jucar Raquepo, Clairelynn Uy, and the Ventura brothers Manok, <a href=\"/3/3/3817\">Ronald</a>, and Olan, alongside the punk sensibility present in the cheeky paintings and constructions of Louie Cordero, Robert Langenegger, Romeo Lee, Manuel Ocampo, Jayson Oliveria, and others."

Even as the more traditional modes of practices in painting and sculpture have persisted, they have also, in a sense, mutated in response to new materials, modes of work, and technology being explored and retooled by artists. And so, while there is still the strong homespun vignette flavor in the works of artists like Jecky Alano, Aba Dalena, Ral Arrogante, Michael Cacnio, Susanito Sarnate, and a hagiographic persuasion behind the sculpture of <a href=\"/3/3/3590\">Toym</a> and Juan Sajid Imao, one would also find these artists intermittently veering into relatively untried territory in relation to their own practices. One concrete instance of how the traditional craft of drawing is taken in an unexpected direction is in Renato Orara&#x2019;s <b><i>Library Bookworm</i></b> series where his drawings are surreptitiously done on the pages of books he then inserts or sites within libraries."

On the other hand, time-, site-, and motion-sensitive media&#x2014;like performance, video, sound, and digital interfaces&#x2014;continue to find ways to coexist with lower-tech as well as more technologically sophisticated production. This broad and often unpredictable pairings and juxtapositions are demonstrated in the works of Anading, Pablo Biglang-Awa, Charles Buenconsejo, Cobangbang, Bunoan, Ermita&#xF1;o, Cocoy Lumbao, M.O.B. (Mail Order Bride), <a href=\"/3/17/3695\">Renan Ortiz</a>, Bong Ramilo, and Tito and Tita, among others."

His embarking on performance in the guise of his avatar, Eco-warrior, is indicative of the healthy restiveness that thrusts creative practice into other modes responsive to the production context in which an artist moves within. It also demonstrates how artists who are identified advocates of traditional practices are not held back from changing the pace and method in their own work."

This has certainly been aided by the onset of more accessible imaging technology from digital online platforms and parallel photography/graphic manipulation app portals, alongside widened circulation circuits. Populist-oriented social media applications have, for instance, allowed the rise of tech-savvy segments of the population who not only explore the use of these new creative tools but also short-circuit channels that guard the art world and/or make new art worlds freed from critical restraint."

This stream runs strongly too in the work of the Negros-based collectives Temple of the Kings and Syano, as well as in the work of the Cagayan de Oro-based Siete Pesos collective, and still other Mindanao-based artists like <a href=\"/3/3/3382\">Ib&#x2019;n Salipyasin Ahmad</a>, Rosalie Zerrudo, among others."

Decidedly gone multimedia if not transmedia, these schools have also opened up fairly new art management/curatorial programs where both potential artists, curators, and cultural workers receive institutional training as well as input from professional artists, programmers, etc. This rise of transmedia and interdisciplinary school and post-school platforms is prefaced by a continually evolving landscape of practice, which includes guild-type or workshop-collaborative learning models that nurtured the career of those from Salakai in the 1990s, and artist-workers of Broke in the 2000s."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Much more recently in this last decade, a discursive and later termed as research-based strain of art practice would surface in various platforms. This non-spectacle, process-based, and performative stream could be seen as displaying affinities with conceptual work of artists like <a href=\"/3/17/3775\">Judy Freya Sibayan</a>. The more logical antecedents are her projects such as the mobile and body-scaled <b><i><strong><a href=\"/3/82/2293\"><strong>Scapular Gallery Nomad</strong></a></strong> </i></b> and the <b><i>Museum of Mental Objects</i></b>, a conceptual archive of ideas peer-accessioned by mostly artists associated with Sibayan. This moving away from the making of objects as primary output, the self-directed research-based work that even has avowedly anti-object strain, presently manifests in archiving, workshops, radio broadcasts, talks, screenings, and performances. While still in a nascent stage, this proposed foil to wholesale co-optation by market mechanisms is still largely under-theorized and more commonly construed as public programming or art education rather than creative practice. Nevertheless, among the schooled visual artists who have taken to this vein is Calubayan who has mined a personal engagement with psychotherapy to research and embody the knowledge-accretion process behind what artists do in what appears to be a lifelong performance. In contrast to this inwardly directed impetus of practice is the interventionist and/or participatory/community-oriented work undertaken by W.A.L.A., and other urban collectives who have resorted to a range of modes from one-off occupations of sites, to more socially immersive engagements with disadvantaged social sectors."
