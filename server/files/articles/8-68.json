The content of the magazines that the public used to read&mdash;the novels and short stories, and eventually, the ubiquitous komiks&mdash;resonated with millions of radio listeners. The same situations that were recounted in written popular texts, the same characters facing similar conflicts, the same kind of language, the predictable resolution to life&rsquo;s iniquities re-appeared in the soap opera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This anthology, edited by noted fictionist and soap opera writer Genoveva Edroza Matute, came out only in 1998. But the narratives included constituted a series on the hugely popular radio station DZRH between Sep 1958 and Jan 1960, when soap operas had a huge following. Chosen as the presentor and the lead actress in the series was Gloria Romero, who in the late 1950s had established her credentials as a true movie queen in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a> Pictures. According to Matute, Romero was chosen to be the host not only because of her status as a movie queen but because of her unblemished reputation. In other words, she had credibility and authority on matters covered by the radio series. The series revolved around proverbs and sayings that have shaped the way millions of Filipinos viewed the world. In this way did the radio series not only strengthen the didactic tradition with which the public had been conditioned to receive popular texts, but likewise ensure its own commercial success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As a result of the series, the exposure of the actors and actresses of Sampaguita Pictures, then one of leading movie firms, was assured. Thus, as the episode began, Gloria Romero introduced her guests that included screen heartthrobs <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4461\"><strong>Luis Gonzales</strong></a>, Juancho Gutierrez, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4723\"><strong>Romeo Vasquez</strong></a>, the top comedians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a> and Panchito, and other stars such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\"><strong>Carmen Rosales</strong></a>, Daisy Romualdez, Carlos Salazar, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4552\"><strong>Mario Montenegro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4559\"><strong>Oscar Moreno</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4451\"><strong>Eddie Garcia</strong></a>, Jose Mari, Van de Leon, Jose de Villa, and a supporting cast of veteran radio talents such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\"><strong>Chichay</strong></a>, Matimtiman Cruz, Caridad Pavico, Ernesto Ramos, and Demetrio Velasquez.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Of further interest is the radio program&rsquo;s sponsor&mdash;San Miguel Brewery, manufacturer of Coca-Cola&mdash;which in the 1940s and early 1950s was a newcomer among the usual sponsors which included such giant corporations as Philippine Refining <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a> (former name of Unilever Philippines, Inc)&mdash;maker of soap, toothpaste, and cooking oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the episodes, Romero invariably plays the leading role&mdash;a sweepstakes vendor, an office clerk, a farmer&rsquo;s daughter, a real estate agent, a good-hearted sweetheart, a teacher, a shy barrio lass, among others. Her traits are well-defined. She has an affectionate heart and a forgiving nature. She is a dutiful daughter, a loving sweetheart, a devoted friend, a solicitous sister, hard-working employee. In some cases, her guests take on roles which have become familiar to movie fans&mdash;Juancho Gutierrez and Luis Gonzales as patient and always warm-hearted suitors; Dolphy as a funny, opportunistic character; Daisy Romualdez as an impetuous, weak-willed young woman; Jose Mari as a young, confused man; and Carmen Rosales as the older character with the proverbial heart of gold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In an episode titled &ldquo;Kung Ano ang Pagkadakila, Ay Siya Rin Namang Lagapak Kung Madapa&rdquo; (The Higher You Go, the Harder You Fall), Gloria Romero plays the role of Luisa, a farmer&rsquo;s daughter.

The arrogant and repulsive Dick is kidnapped by two farmers, both victims of Don Mamerto&rsquo;s cruelty, but through the timely intervention of Luisa, the kidnappers free Dick. The rich man confesses that he has lost his money in bad investments and has decided to sell parcels of his land to the tenants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In another episode framed by the proverb, &ldquo;Ang Lumalakad nang Matulin, Kung Matinik ay Malalim&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Who Walks in Haste May be Deeply Hurt with Thorns), the truth behind the adage is illustrated in the character played by Daisy Romualdez. Romero is Gloria while Romualdez plays the role of Daisy. The two women not only work in the same office but are also close friends. But little do they know that Daisy&rsquo;s boyfriend has been using both Daisy and Gloria to advance his nefarious scheme to sell fake stocks to Mr. Villagracia, the employer of Gloria and Daisy. The boyfriend is shot and in the end repents of his crime.

Betty is played by the veteran actress Carmen Rosales. Luis Villareal, the scion of a rich family, is in love with the young teacher. But the course of love is not smooth. Marita realizes this when she finds out that Betty has been earning a living as a nightclub singer in Cebu, and that Don Vicente Villareal, Luis&rsquo;s arrogant father, upon finding out that Betty is the beloved of Mike Millan, the older Villareal&rsquo;s half-brother, has nothing but contempt for Betty. Marita rushes off to Cebu, having decided to live with her sister Betty. But as the episode ends, all of Don Vicente&rsquo;s fears disappear when he finds out that Betty, despite her numerous suitors, has remained virtuous.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The rest of the episodes tell interesting stories most of which are components of traditional writing&rsquo;s constructs&mdash;themes of unrequited love, betrayal, poverty, death.

Author, Elizabeth L. Enriquez. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press. With a CD containing sound recordings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">For too long, the history of Philippine mass media has waited to be written. In this volume, Elizabeth L. Enriquez has presented media practitioners, scholars, and the general public with a book that will establish itself as a classic in its field, and sets new levels for presentation and analysis of its subject matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The history of radio in the Philippines is colorful, filled with individuals of different persuasions and personalities. First, radio was introduced in the Philippines during the American colonial period. The colonial accoutrements were there, as Enriquez aptly points out: business interests (both in selling radios and advertising products made in the United States or US); and dovetailing with the colonial policy of molding Filipinos in the American image. What better medium to use than the new technology of radio which could reach anyone who could afford a radio set?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But the Americans did not have the last say. The thrust of this book is how Filipinos appropriated the colonial tool of radio and made it their own, how in the process of its growth and development, the medium was indigenized or Filipinized. In fact, although the station owners were mainly American, the broadcasters were Filipino and they catered to the Filipino audiences&rsquo; tastes and developed their own styles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This is a pioneering work. There have been earlier, shorter histories of Philippine radio, among them the standard work by American John Lent. In fact, much of modern radio and media theory did come from the US. But these works tended to be very brief, more of outlines or anecdotal works rather than fully developed histories. Others were difficult to access as they were not widely available. Sources were scattered, and the ephemeral nature of radio programs was such that very few remained to be documented and analyzed. Most scripts were simply thrown away after use, thus resulting in a shortage of this type of primary material. Few radio programs were recorded then, considering the difficulty and cost of audio recording technology in those days (i.e. using heavy equipment to cut disks; magnetic recordings were still experimental then). The destruction of Manila in 1945 resulted in the loss of many documents and historical materials, not to mention the destruction of radio stations themselves. Thus the early attempts at writing histories of radio were brief and incomplete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Enriquez has done an excellent job of tracking down various types of sources and tying them up together into a cohesive and probing narrative. A quick glance at the notes and bibliography reveals the great amount of research done&mdash;from archival materials in the US National Archives (it is ironic that there is no similar institution covering the same area here), to periodicals of that era, to articles and documents in Japanese and interviews with surviving radio personalities or their next of kin. Enriquez was fortunate enough to have documented the lives and stories of some of these radio greats, such as Francisco &ldquo;Koko&rdquo; Trinidad and Fidela &ldquo;Tiya Dely&rdquo; Magpayo. Both have since passed away&mdash;Tiya Dely only last 1 Sep 2008. In documenting these personalities and assembling the vast amount of historical material, Enriquez is to be commended. The amount of research is very impressive, and much information is unearthed and brought back to life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But this book is not just a compendium of data; it is not a simple chronicle or tabulation of radio stations, dates of first broadcasts and radio station owners. It is an interpretative history and discusses radio not by and for itself, but within the context of the colonial administration, war, and changing peoples&rsquo; lives. In short it relates radio with its milieu, and in the process brings out the emergence of a Filipino medium, from its colonial beginnings. Enriquez is careful not to focus entirely on Manila; she also brings in stations in Cebu to show that Filipinization was not a monopoly of Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To situate the general reader, Enriquez starts by providing the concepts, theories, and unique features of constructing a history of Philippine radio. She then explains her sources and methods, before proceeding to the history itself. She also includes a brief history of US radio which is very important in situating Philippine radio. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> gets to understand how strongly molded the management and broadcast styles of Philippine radio were influenced by the US in concrete terms (e.g. the origin of the radio call signs such as KZRH&ndash;K standing for radio stations west of the Mississippi). In essence, she covers two climactic periods in Philippine history, during which time radio in the Philippines was born and adapted to Philippine conditions: the American colonial period and the World War II (Japanese occupation) in the Philippines. Enriquez shows how radio, while initially serving colonial ends, grew and matured, and assumed its own character, beyond colonial aims. Radio could be used, and was used, as a form of resistance against the colonizer through critical commentaries and indirect hits at the Americans. But the importance of Filipino radio emerged during the Japanese occupation, when Filipino broadcasters risked their lives to broadcast the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4989\"><strong>Voice of Freedom</strong></a></i></b> and defy Japanese control and propaganda. Enriquez spotlights the radio heroes who have been largely forgotten by later generations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Enriquez then concludes by showing how radio was not simply accepted by Filipinos without question. While there was some obvious copying (or mimicry still evident to this day), there was more of appropriation&mdash;molding the medium to suit Filipino needs and temperament&ndash;and even resistance. Radio eventually became a form of Filipino cultural expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book ends with some comments on the author&rsquo;s experiences and lessons in constructing this history, as a guide or inspiration to future researchers and writers. Enriquez points out that her work is one way of looking at Philippine radio&rsquo;s past, and advises: <i>&ldquo;</i>More histories should then be written, from as many viewpoints as possible, in order to enrich our knowledge of the past. Then we might have a fuller view of the present.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The book particularly benefits from Enriquez being a radio veteran herself. She writes as a practitioner, familiar with the ins and outs of the industry. Her own experience and insights into the radio industry proved valuable in writing this history. As an insider she could identify issues and points which outsiders would not generally be aware of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Since this is a history of radio in the Philippines, audio recordings of actual broadcasts, announcers and music of the period are likewise invaluable in evaluating radio&rsquo;s performance. Enriquez has very thoughtfully provided readers (buyers) of the book with a compact disc containing period music recordings and a recording of General Wainwright&rsquo;s surrender of Corregidor in May 1942.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Equally interesting and important are the photographs reproduced in the book, many of them published for the first time. The pictures give more life to the text as the individuals, studios and ads can be seen, not through the mists of time but as clearly as they were when they were still current.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Any history cannot hope to be complete&mdash;one cannot hope to find every radio program, every radio announcer, and every radio ad here. That should not be expected and this is pointed out by the author herself. One shortcoming is the reaction of listeners, since surveys were not yet in practice then. However, perhaps a little more depth could have been given to the owners and founders of the radio stations&mdash;Henry Herman, Isaac Beck, Samuel Gaches who were very important Americans in the prewar Philippines. What made them decide to open their stations? How much did they benefit from them? Publicity-wise, they reaped much but this is not too clear in the book. A little more exploration into control measures might have been made, especially since some news anchors and analysts were considered dangerous by both Filipino and American authorities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the local police did watch over some broadcasters before the war. Did the US Federal Communications Commission and security regulations apply to Philippine radio? There are, too, few typographical errors which are distracting to the discerning reader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">But this is not meant as a complete history of Philippine radio. In fact, as the author notes, there can never be a complete, objective history, given the gaps in sources. But Enriquez, in this book, presents a history of the early years of Philippine radio which will be hard to match. She has set a standard in the writing of mass media histories that raises the level of scholarship in institutional history. Doubtless there are other scattered historical materials on radio to be found (there are articles in the American Chamber of Commerce Journal, for example). But they will not alter the basic thesis Enriquez propounds, for it is sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">As the book ends in 1946, the need for a follow-up volume on the years following becomes obvious. That should be a challenge for future researchers because postwar Philippine radio had its own high points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Enriquez and the University of the Philippines Press should be congratulated on the very readable, thorough, and well-researched book. It should be a must-read for media practitioners so that they will be aware of the roots of their craft and the pride in being Filipino. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by Ricardo T.

First, radio was introduced in the Philippines during the American colonial period.

What better medium to use than the new technology of radio which could reach anyone who could afford a radio set?"

The thrust of this book is how Filipinos appropriated the colonial tool of radio and made it their own, how in the process of its growth and development, the medium was indigenized or Filipinized.

In fact, much of modern radio and media theory did come from the US. But these works tended to be very brief, more of outlines or anecdotal works rather than fully developed histories. Others were difficult to access as they were not widely available. Sources were scattered, and the ephemeral nature of radio programs was such that very few remained to be documented and analyzed. Most scripts were simply thrown away after use, thus resulting in a shortage of this type of primary material. Few radio programs were recorded then, considering the difficulty and cost of audio recording technology in those days (i.e. using heavy equipment to cut disks; magnetic recordings were still experimental then). The destruction of Manila in 1945 resulted in the loss of many documents and historical materials, not to mention the destruction of radio stations themselves. Thus the early attempts at writing histories of radio were brief and incomplete."

Published 1997. Author, Epifanio G. Matute. With a Preface by Genoveva Edroza Matute and an <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1550\"><strong>Essay</strong></a> by I.P. Soliongco. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"Bodytextno-indent\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This book is a compilation of 20 of Matute&rsquo;s scripts for the radio program, which aired from 1938 to 1960, interrupted only by World War II. It brings to the contemporary reader the genius of the whole ensemble (including Narciso Pimentel Jr, Lucas Paredes, Fidel Sicam, Tony Gosalvez, Nati Valentin, and Oscar del Rosario) responsible for producing one of the wittiest and most hard-hitting radio programs in history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The episodes of <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/68/1530\"><strong>Kuwentong Kutsero</strong></a></i></b> revolve around the hilarious incidents in the life of an ordinary family in the city. Mang Teban, a rig driver, does his rounds in the city&rsquo;s crowded streets and meets a motley of interesting people. His wife, Terya, is a loudmouth and parsimonious character. They have three children: Tony, a lawyer without any clients; Celia, a teacher; and Junior, an irrepressible, adventurous smart aleck and the bane of the household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Often the source of misunderstanding because of his deafness is Kapitan Hugo, a brilliant comic character straight from the revolutionary past, with his constant threat of using his bolo to bamboozle or punish an erring character. Other memorable characters include Daniel Discurso, in love with rhetorical flights of fancy; Cruz Pasangcruz, a teacher from the Visayas, whose accent causes hilarity; and Akong Santosi, the Chinese character whose way of speaking pidgin Tagalog parodies that of Chinese Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the scripts collected, the situation is usually set after the family dinner, when a member of the family stumbles onto something that eventually brings about a misunderstanding, usually precipitated by Kapitan Hugo&rsquo;s ability to attribute different meanings to a word he has misheard. Asked how old he is, he rattles off facts about his dead wife named Edad, the common noun of which means age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In another episode, Celia&rsquo;s fountain pen becomes &ldquo;pinting pen,&rdquo; which Aling Terya thinks is something used for painting the lips with. As Teban explains what a &ldquo;listik&rdquo; (lipstick) is, Lolo Hugo hears &ldquo;lintik&rdquo; (lightning), which is a curse word. Lolo Hugo threatens to let loose fire and brimstone against the &ldquo;potty-mouthed&rdquo; son.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The scripts follow this structure: the setting and the situation are set, followed by the complication leading to inevitable confusion and often vociferous arguments. A commercial break is followed by further complications among the family members, more arguments, miscues, and misunderstanding, into which sometimes other characters are dragged. The confusion is cleared in the denouement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some memorable episodes include &ldquo;Titina, My Titina,&rdquo; which is the family&rsquo;s encounter with a widow who takes a fancy to Tony; &ldquo;Natodas ang Broadcast&rdquo; (The Broadcast Was Bombed), where the whole family troops to a radio station to hear Lolo Hugo read a portion of a script, which predictably gets messed up; or &ldquo;Nagmilagro si Junior&rdquo; (Junior Performed a Miracle), where the naughty boy, pretending to be a prophet, attracts attention and contributions from the gullible people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The scripts succeed in incorporating topical issues into the storylines. &ldquo;Ano Bang Klaseng Trapik Ito?&rdquo; (What Kind of Traffic Is This?) describes the horrendous traffic in Manila, where the <i>karetela</i> or horse-drawn cart, a symbol of the past, is at the mercy of trucks and buses. In &ldquo;Natampal ng Hapon&rdquo; (Slapped by a Jap), an enterprising group plans to lobby for war reparations on behalf of those who were slapped by the Japanese, each slap pegged at a thousand pesos. &ldquo;Politikang Kasoy&rdquo; (Nutty Politics) tackles an issue that has bedeviled Philippine politics&ndash;the crass opportunism of politicians, their deceitful and hypocritical ways, and their total disregard of the people&rsquo;s interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b><i>Kuwentong Kutsero </i></b>is heir to the trickster tales of folk literature, the satires of the Propagandists, and the<i> dagli </i>(flash fiction)<b> </b>and <i>pasingaw</i> (sketch) of early 20th-century journalism. Its intelligent and well-thought out critique of society is a vibrant affirmation of the tradition of protest, through irony and satire, that continues to live on in our culture. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5645\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> S.

The seven plays were collected to provide teachers of creative writing with actual models of the specific genre that had become increasingly popular in the 1960s and 1970s, even before the emergence of another dictinct form, the <b>teleserye</b><i> </i>and its variant, the <b>pantaserye</b><i> </i>(fantasy television series), in the 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Unlike the teleserye or pantaserye and their simulation in visual and auditory terms of the conventions of the novel, the teleplay defined itself within the parameters of a theatrical play, but with the television audience as the public. During its heyday, the teleplay aired on almost all channels and occupied primetime slot. Among the more popular series were <b><i>Balintataw </i></b>(The Mind&rsquo;s Eye<b><i>)</i></b>,<b><i> Spotlight</i></b>, <b><i>PETAbisyon</i></b>, <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim </i></b>(Night of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\"><strong>Horror</strong></a>),<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> Maalala Mo Kaya </i></b>(Will You Remember).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Armando Lao&rsquo;s <b><i>Gabay sa Pagsulat ng Teleplay</i></b> (Guide for Writing the Teleplay) lays down the rules and principles for writing a teleplay. The greater part of the essay tackles the qualities of the ideal plot, character, tone and atmosphere, language, and such literary devices as irony and symbolism, commonly found in books on creative writing that hew to modernism and realism. But the essay also spends some time on the limitations of writing for television (e.g. episodic treatment, variable production crew) as well as the advantages of the same (e.g. a wider market, the power to explore themes seldom portrayed in films, the possibility of sharpening one&rsquo;s skill).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The seven plays written by dfferent authors have been chosen to represent a variety of texts using different types of subject matter and techiques.

It revolves around a conflicted homosexual character, a father to a fifteen-year-old daughter who has come back after ten years of staying in the States. As the plot unfolds, the daughter discovers the father&rsquo;s secret and the revelation has a great effect on the girl.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the whole, the teleplay succeeds in pushing the narrative to its denouement, the discovery of the secret, and better yet, in forging a closer relationship between the father and his estranged daughter. But the breezy pace of the narrative hinders a fuller exploration of the characters&rsquo; interior lives. Nonetheless &rdquo;Sampung Taon&rdquo; is a good example of how to use dialogue, especially in fleshing out the characters of a spoiled Filipino-American, a gay man, a maid, and a pained lover in the person of Bob, the rich man with a male lover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Bilanggo&rdquo; (Prisoner) by famed playwright and fictionist Ricky Lee brings the reader to an entirely different world, a mixture of illusion and reality, a riveting journey into an activist&rsquo;s bloody past now tranformed into horrible dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The teleplay reminds the reader of Kafka&rsquo;s novels with their protagonists trapped literally and symbolically, and unable to free themselves from the prison. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1516\"><strong>Tisoy</strong></a>/Luis/Manolo are the names of the male character interacting with Elynia, a bank teller who lives alone in her cramped apartment. How she nurtures the man who appears to have lost his mind shapes the plot that ends with Manolo&rsquo;s regaining his sanity and Elynia banished from his life. However, Elynia feels triumphant because she is carrying his child, to remind her of the time she learned how to love a helpless man who turns out to have been an activist forced by his torturers in the military to betray his comrades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Hello, Paalam&rdquo; (Hello, Goodbye), by Fanny Garcia, on the other hand, the political thrust which Lee&rsquo;s teleplay deftly interweaves into the plot makes its appearance in the person of Richard Johnson, an American who came to the Philippines to teach Physical Education, as part of an exchange program. He falls for Auring, the daughter of the school principal, makes her pregnant, but refuses to accept responsibility. The relationship between the power and the powerless is played out when Richard offers wads of dollars to Auring who throws them away. The neighbors fight over the money. As the play ends, Auring catches a glimpse of a dollar on the floor, steps on it, and kicks it away with a smile on her lips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a lengthy work, &ldquo;Amboy,&rdquo; Dado C. Lumibao explores, with unfailing strength, various types of relationships&mdash;father and son, brother and brother, the Philipines and the United States. Having achieved the American dream as a doctor in the United States, Steve comes home to try to save his father suffering from cancer. A believer in the efficacy of modern medicine, Steve finds himself thwarted in his attempt to treat his father by his older brother, Daniel, a farmer like their father who believes in traditional medicine. The conflict comes to a head as the old man lies dying. As the play ends, the basis for the animosity between the two brothers is traced to envy. Daniel resents his younger and more intelligent brother for his success, while Steve, as he observes the kind of life Daniel and his family lead, admires the love and warmth shared by the family. Even Mickey, Steve&rsquo;s spoiled son, has learned to appreciate the simplicity of life in the province.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In &ldquo;Pangalawang Pagkakataon&rdquo; (Second Chance), Armando Lao skillfully deploys his knowledge of character and narrative technique to infuse the perfectly ordinary life of Gerry, a doctor whose mother has recently died, with enough mystery that truly intrigues. He has always been wondering what would have happened to him had his mother, who was about to abandon him as an infant, not seen a bag next to a man covered with blood. It turned out that the bag contained money which the mother used to turn her life around, build a restaurant, and support Gerry&rsquo;s medical studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The intricately plotted narrative, where events of the past and present are effectively juxtaposed, eventually leads to Gerry&rsquo;s realization that the man covered in blood is what Gerry himself could have been had his mother not seized the opportunity years ago to run away with the bag of money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other two teleplays are a study in contrast. Jose D. Bartolome&rsquo;s &ldquo;Home Along the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1272\"><strong>Riles</strong></a>&rdquo; (Home by the Railroad Tracks) uses the typical conventions of the comedy&mdash;mistaken identity, humor through situation and dialogue, stereotypical characters, convoluted plot&mdash;not only to arouse laughter but to critique the obsession of many Filipinos to leave for jobs abroad which, in numerous cases, has led to destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On the other hand, the final text, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5104\"><strong>Lualhati Bautista</strong></a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Babaeng-Babae&rdquo; (Woman Through and Through), is a compelling utilization of various techniques associated with a documentary, and its reliance on facts and objectivity, to express pointed commentaries on what it means to be a woman in a highly phallocentric society. Choosing key moments from actual historical event like strikes, and sequencing them to build up the tension help in telling a story of female exploitation that ends in a march by women for their cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">That it took some time to collect these plays is a pointed commentary on the situation of a popular form. That the seven plays are now in book form is a tribute to the people who made this project a success, even as the book claims its position as a source of insights into the production of the teleplay. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\"></span><em><strong>Written by<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5645\"><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>Soledad</strong></a> S.

The newly discovered power of radio was its ability to mold public opinion, a power the current crop of broadcasters has taken on seriously. Indeed, the radio has since the 1960s taken to offering an alternative discourse dfferent from what government press releases have attempted to sell, even as they have also encouraged feedback and discussion from their listeners.

But its role in Philippine society is as complex and multilayered, and is not without controversy. As a more exciting medium using visual and auditory techniques to &ldquo;reflect&rdquo; reality, it resembles films. But as a familiar medium, television has occupied a permanent place in any household, a box-like or flat structure that can be flicked open and turned off at any time, and watched in the company of the family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The monograph and the video documentary, which visualizes the narrative and issues of the monograph, chronicle the stages in the growth of television. They begin by tracing the emergence of the first television station, Channel 3, to the decision of Judge Antonio Quirino to help his brother, then Pres Elpidio Quirino, win his reelection bid in 1953. Although canned programs were shown, Channel 3 also beamed local shows such as <b><i>Pista ng Caltex </i></b>(Caltex Fiesta)<b><i> </i></b>featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a> and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a> </i></b>(Call of the Stage)<b><i> </i></b>with Lopito and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\"><strong>Chichay</strong></a>. In 1957, Quirino sold his Alto Broadcasting System to Eugenio Lopez of the Chronicle Broadcasting Network and the two networks were combined to form what eventually became the giant <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The decade of the 1960s witnessed the growth of television with the opening of several other stations owned by business conglomerates. Imported blockbuster programs from the United States appeared on the screen of televiewers increasingly enamored of crime and adventure stories, situation comedies featuring handsome and pretty stars, and glossy musical programs. Despite this constant barrage of imported fare, however, local talents asserted themselves in this period and found an appreciative audience among the televiewers. A few came from films, some from the tradition of the stage, others were unknowns who became hugely popular as hosts/dancers/singers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1970s, the power of television as a political tool became more than apparent. And in the furious struggle for power waged by Ferdinand Marcos against the oligarchs headed by Eugenio Lopez, the giant ABS-CBN corporation was defeated. The landscape changed dramatically when Marcos declared martial law in 1972. The television stations, except Channel 7, were sequestered. Channel 5 (owned by the Roces family) and Channel 11 (owned by the Elizaldes) and Channel 13 were effectively shut down. Only Channels 2 and 9, run by Marcos&rsquo;s friend Roberto Benedicto, held sway over the broadcasting industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">By the 1970s, the trends had been defined: musicals, drama series, situation comedies, broadcast news. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2108\"><strong>Multimedia</strong></a> personalities like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4982\"><strong>Helen Vela</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4675\"><strong>Vilma Santos</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a>, Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, Joey de Leon, among others, continued to dish out familiar entertainment fare for the millions of television viewers.

As a more exciting medium using visual and auditory techniques to &#x201C;reflect&#x201D; reality, it resembles films. But as a familiar medium, television has occupied a permanent place in any household, a box-like or flat structure that can be flicked open and turned off at any time, and watched in the company of the family."
