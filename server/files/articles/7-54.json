The dramatic forms that flourished and continue to flourish among the different peoples of the archipelago include indigenous theater, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic dances</a>, and mimetic customs; plays with Spanish influence, among which are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong>,</a> the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/433#playlets\">religious playlets</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a>, theater with Anglo-American influence, which encompasses <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> and the plays in English; and modern or original plays by Filipinos, which employ a range of styles drawn from contemporary modern theater or revitalize traditional forms from within or outside the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"indigenous\" name=\"indigenous\"></a>The Indigenous Traditions and Transformations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, dances, and customs which are still performed with urgency and vitality by the different cultural communities that comprise about 17 percent of the country&rsquo;s population are held or performed, together or separately, on the occasion of a person&rsquo;s birth, baptism, circumcision, initial menstruation, courtship, wedding, sickness, and death; or as a celebration of tribal activities like hunting, fishing, rice planting and harvesting, and going to war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most rituals a native priest (or priestess) variously called&nbsp;<em>mandadawak</em>,&nbsp;<em>catalonan</em>,&nbsp;<em>mambunong</em>,&nbsp;<em>bayok</em>, babaylan,&nbsp;<em>baylan</em>, or&nbsp;<em>babalyan</em>, goes into a trance as the spirit he (or she) calls upon possesses him (or her). While entranced, the shaman partakes of the sacrificial offering, which may be a chicken, a pig, or a carabao, depending on the gravity of the spirit&rsquo;s anger, or may simply be uncooked rice, rice cakes, rice wine, and betel nut. This act, which represents the death of the supplicant in the hands of the spirit, adapts itself to the occasion for which the ritual is held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a> of Palawan in southern Philippines, the ritual of the <strong>diwata</strong>, which crowns a series of activities addressed to the spirits of ancestors, is held after the rice harvest, on the last three days of the last moon. In this ritual, they ask their supreme deity Mangindusa, the other gods, and the spirits of their ancestors for a bountiful harvest and for the well-being of the supplicants. For this most significant socioeconomic and religious event, the interior of the home of the babalyan is decorated with stripped palm leaves and bamboo slats inscribed with Tagbanwa writing and designs. At the center of the large room, ritual offerings are carefully arranged: a small wooden boat hanging from the ceiling, which serves as the ancestors&rsquo;s transport from the spirit world; a mat on which bowls or plates of uncooked rice, jewelry, betel nuts, rice cakes (which are all later consumed by the people), and ginger and onions are spread; a ritual bamboo swing where the babalyan will sit and chant; a stool with more food offerings; and the all-important wine jars set in a line in front of the swing and provided with oil-rubbed straws through which the spirits/babalyan will sip the rice wine. For the Tagbanwa, wine is not found in the spirit world, so it is the one item that best attracts spirits to the celebration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the heady music of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a>, the babalyan&rsquo;s assistant, dressed in a sarong skirt, tight blouse, and sash from which the&nbsp;<em>karis&nbsp;</em>(wavy long knife) hangs, opens the ritual by performing several dances and shaking the&nbsp;<em>ugsang&nbsp;</em>(stripped palm leaves) in both hands, in honor of Mangindusa who is supposed to be perched on the roof of the house. This part ends with the babalyan letting out a scream and pulling the ceremonial staff attached to the ceiling to denote that Mangindusa has departed. Soon after, the babalyan, also in a similar skirt and blouse but with a black hood covering her face, works herself into a trance as she sips wine and throws herself in the middle of the room. She then dances, balancing a bowl with rice or a bowl with candles or a&nbsp;<em>karis&nbsp;</em>on her head while brandishing the palm leaves or two porcelain bowls or a piece of cloth in her hands, as she is followed by her assistant. To the continuous beating of the gongs, the babalyan may then shake the palm leaves violently, strike the sides of the wine jar angrily, and sip wine, denoting that a spirit has taken hold of her. As other spirits take turns possessing her, the babalyan&rsquo;s movements may change&mdash;one spirit may prompt her to sip wine, soft drinks, or water; another may want to smoke cigarettes with those participating in the ritual; others may want her to dance with a long knife or bolo on her head, oil the women&rsquo;s hair, or lead the singing of the spirit song. The series of possessions is capped with those present drinking, smoking, and participating in the activities of the ritual (Fox 1982).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, these animistic rituals survive today even among Christianized Filipinos. In Isabela, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/34\"><strong>atang-atang</strong></a> ritual of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a> features a gaily decorated small bamboo raft with offerings of rice, oil, eggs, cigarettes, rice cakes, and a little chick representing the soul of the sick person. Around this raft situated on the ground, two women dance, drink, and chant Christian prayers to cure the sick. Later, the women take oil from the raft and rub it on the face, legs, or hands of the sick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from rituals, tribal dances, which were more often than not mimetic, may also be considered proto-dramas. A majority of these dances, which mark important events like baptism, courtship, marriage, and even death, also depict important tribal activities. The tribes of the Cordillera have dances that reenact the hunting and killing of a boar, as well as the practice of headhunting. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a> of Zambales perform dances that show the techniques of gathering wild honey in the forest as well as those of hunting for fish. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> of Sulu boast of dances that represent how oranges are picked or how not to catch a mudfish. The most important dance among most Philippine indigenous groups, however, is the war dance. The war dance of the Higaonon or Northern Bukidnon of Mindanao imitates the movements of warriors who fight with spears and shields. Similarly, proto-dramas are the dances which are playful imitations of animals, like the monkey, fish, and fly dances of the Aeta of Zambales in Luzon; the hawk dances of the Higaonon in Mindanao; and the butterfly, monkey, and bird dances of the Tausug and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> in Sulu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mimetic too are some of the customs associated with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\">courtship</a>, marriage, and death among the ethnic communities. Of the courtship customs, the most common is the debate between a male and a female that may employ verse, song, and dance. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> <strong>panonoroon</strong> has a boy and a girl chanting metaphorical verses to each other, with the boy offering his love to the girl and the latter warding off his verbal advances. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/442\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a> features antiphonal songs performed by male and female who talk not only of love but also of the problems faced by married couples and rural workers. Among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, the&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\">duplo</a></strong> or debate in song and dance becomes an exchange of spoken verses. Male poets called <strong>bilyako</strong> use proverbs, riddles, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><em>pasyon</em></a>, the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>(<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>), as well as contemporary events to advance their suits to the female poets called <strong>bilyaka</strong> of their choice. In the 1920s, the duplo became a formal debate on an issue and was then called the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\"><strong>balagtasan</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mimetic customs related to weddings include the Tagalog <strong>pamanhikan</strong>, where representatives of the families of both the boy and the girl speak in metaphorical language to settle the dowry or bride price; and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> <strong>samsung</strong>, where, after the bride price is paid, the bride and the groom are &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to sit beside each other with their hair tied together even as the bride &ldquo;objects.&rdquo; On the other hand, mimetic customs related to death are exemplified by the <strong>baraning usa</strong> of the Aeta of Camarines, where a deer made of banana stalk and twigs is &ldquo;hunted down&rdquo; and offered to the dead to be taken to the next life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, short <strong>dance-dramas</strong> may narrate a story or dramatize an episode from known epics. The <strong>pandamgo</strong> of the Matigsalug is a series of scenes showing how a mother raises her daughter from childhood to maturity, how the girl is courted by two men, how the mother openly favors one man over the man that the girl prefers, how the men fight each other for the girl, and how they kill each other in the process. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><strong>singkil</strong></a> dance of the Maranao enacts an episode from the epic <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></em></strong>, where Prince Bantugan saves the princess Gandingan from the evil mountain spirits who try to stop the couple by hurling trees on Bantugan&rsquo;s path and opening up the earth to swallow Gandingan. Bantugan sucessfully dances between a gamut of clashing shields held by two rows of men, which represents the trees, while Gandingan deftly dances over eight pairs of clashing bamboos representing the earthquake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a whole, indigenous dramas are well integrated into the lives of tribal Filipinos. These rituals, dances, and customs express their very beliefs, activities, and material culture. Furthermore, they help fulfill the basic needs of the tribe for a good harvest, victory in war, and the physical and spiritual well-being of their sick, their newborns, their youth, and their newlyweds. Finally, these plays create a stronger bond among the members of the tribe and bind them to work for the common good. Rituals of baptism, circumcision, and marriage, as well as the dances that instruct children on the techniques of looking for honey, fishing, or fighting in war clearly work for the collective good. A good harvest, as well as plentiful honey and fish obviously benefit the tribe, while the display of war dances teaches young boys their primary duty as men&mdash;namely, fighting off aggressors to ensure the survival of the tribe. Similarly, the customs associated with courtship, marriage, and death provide a way of expressing personal emotions in a socially accepted manner and of informing all of new ties that will have to be respected by everyone so that harmony may reign in their society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"hispanic\" name=\"hispanic\"></a>Hispanic Traditions and Transformations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the more than three centuries of Spanish rule from 1565 to 1898, the Spanish colonizers, specifically the friars, showed a keen awareness of the power of theater both as a tool for the Christianization of the natives and as a magnet to attract the latter to settle in the&nbsp;<em>pueblo&nbsp;</em>(town), which constituted the foundation of Spain&rsquo;s empire in the archipelago. The Spanish regime introduced and popularized various types of secular and religious plays. Secular plays were usually staged to celebrate town fiestas, while religious plays were usually mounted to highlight important Catholic liturgical feasts or seasons like Christmas, Lent, or Easter. Many of these plays and playlets continue to be popular among the Christianized folk who live in the rural areas and compose the majority of the total population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of these plays, the most important is the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, a play in verse introduced into the country from Spain in the 16th century and institutionalized in the 19th century. There are two main types of komedya: the secular komedya known as <strong>moro-moro</strong>, <strong>linambay</strong>, or <strong>arakyo</strong>, which is on the conflict between Moors and Christians in medieval Europe, and the religious komedya, which dramatizes the lives of patron saints. This theatrical spectacle takes 3-15 hours and several sessions to perform. Elaborate marches, lengthy choreographed fight scenes, and magical artifices wrought by heaven to save saints or Christians in distress ensure the popularity of the komedya as principal entertainment during town fiestas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>orihinal</strong> (script) of the secular komedya, which derives its stories from native versions of European metrical romances, usually depicts the conflict between Christian princes and princesses and their Moorish counterparts. Typical of the stories of the secular komedya is the arakyo still performed in several towns of Nueva Ecija, which revolves around Elena and Constantino&rsquo;s search for the Cross of Christ. As performed in Pe&ntilde;aranda, Nueva Ecija, in 1986, the story of the arakyo remains basically what it was at the turn of the century when this play, also known as <strong>tibag</strong>, first became popular. After his father, King Constancio of Rome and Constantipole, is killed by the Turks, the young Constantino sits on the throne and brings war to the&nbsp;<em>emperador&nbsp;</em>(emperor) of Turquia to avenge his father&rsquo;s death. Worried about the outcome of the war, Elena is assured by a voice from heaven that victory would be given to Constantino, but that he and Elena should in turn look for the cross on which Christ died. Constantino wins the war and kills the emperador of Turquia. Meanwhile, Queen Elena has left for the Holy Land to look for the Redeemer&rsquo;s cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Princess Ordelisa of Turquia now bids farewell to her father, Emperador Costroas, and leads a mission to the Christian court. She demands Constantino&rsquo;s surrender and exacts vengeance on Constantino&rsquo;s general, Lucero, with whom she is secretly in love and who, with his companions, made trouble when they joined the tournament in Turquia some years back. Meanwhile, Queen Elena has found the cross but loses it to the Moors who intercept and attack her. Informed of this, Constantino sends Lucero on a mission to Turquia to demand that Costroas give back the cross. The mission fails, but it brings Lucero face-to-face with Ordelisa once again. The general pledges his undying love for the Moorish princess and proves it by laying down his arms. But the other Moors pounce on, imprison, and sentence him to death by beheading. Ordelisa, who is now convinced of Lucero&rsquo;s love, decides to free him. In the end, a big battle is waged between the Christians led by Constantino and Elena, and the Moors under Costroas and Ordelisa. Elena is about to kill Ordelisa when Lucero intervenes and begs for her life. Defeated, the Moors agree to be baptized &ldquo;so that the dirt of their souls may be washed away.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional are the arakyo&rsquo;s sets and costumes, its stylized gestures and rhetorical delivery of verses, its&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\">marcha</a>&nbsp;</em>(slow march) and&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\">paso doble</a>&nbsp;</em>(fast march) accompanied by band music, as well as the scenes of love between Moorish princess and Christian general, the&nbsp;<em>embahada&nbsp;</em>(mission) between kingdoms, the dances to relieve the audience from long stretches of monotonous dialogue, and the theatrical artifices. Supported by <strong>hermanos mayores</strong> (principal sponsors) and by donations from individuals, the arakyo, like many traditional komedya today, is cherished by the townspeople, for it is a form of dance-prayer or an extended dramatic devotional to the Santa Cruz (Holy Cross) presented to ask for favors and blessings on both kin and community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not as numerous as the secular komedya, the religious komedya called <strong>komedya de santo</strong> hardly survives to this day. Typical of these didactic komedya, which were used by Spanish friars to teach Christianity and inculcate Christian colonial values, is one staged in Iligan City&mdash;the <strong><em>Comedia de San Miguel</em></strong> (Play of San Miguel), written ca. 1890. Also called <strong><em>Yawa-Yawa</em></strong> (literally, Devil-Devil), this komedya tells the story of how Lusbel rebelled against God and how God ordered San Miguel Arcangel (Iligan City&rsquo;s patron saint) to quell the heavenly revolts and drive Lusbel, his cohorts, and the Seven Capital Sins, represented by a huge seven-headed monster, to hell where they are punished forever for their pride and rebelliousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the Philippine religious plays, the most outstanding and enduring has been the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\">sinakulo</a>, also known as the <strong>pasion y muerte</strong> (passion and death), <strong>tanggal</strong> (literally, to remove) and <strong>centurion</strong>, which probably saw light in the mid-18th century. Staged commercially or as community activity during Lent and often for eight consecutive nights during Holy Week, the sinakulo started as a dramatization of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g&nbsp;<strong>Genesis</strong></em></strong></a>, the most popular verse narrative on the life and sufferings of Jesus Christ, and later was augmented by apocryphal stories from other pasyon and religious books like the <strong><em>Martir sa Golgota</em></strong> (The Martyr of Golgotha), and popular reading materials like <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></strong></em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Tambo, Buhi, Camarines Sur, the passion play known as tanggal is a folk interpretation of events of the passion that is distinguished both by its charm and simplicity as by its faith and fervor. For almost three whole days and with financial support from the barrio, older members of an itinerant group of <strong>tanggalista</strong> (members of the tanggal group) chant the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> pasyon and other episodes, from the Creation of the World to the Search for the Holy Cross by Elena and Constantino, while the younger members of the group dramatize the actions narrated by the chant. Most popular are the following: doleful scenes like Christ saying farewell to his mother before he goes to his martyrdom; comic scenes featuring the antics of Judas Iscariot, the great comedian in any passion play; scenes of spectacle like the storm at sea where the apostles take a little boat ride on Lake Buhi, sometimes beside bathing carabaos; colorful scenes like the descent of the Holy Spirit on Mary and the Apostles; and finally, dramatic scenes like the assumption and coronation of the Virgin in heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cainta, Rizal, the sinakulo is staged for several nights with spectacular sets, colorful costumes, dramatic dialogue, with emphasis on <strong>artipisyo</strong> or special effects. Here and in other towns of Rizal and Bulacan, a shortened form of the sinakulo is performed on the street on Good Friday. Whether on stage or on the street, the sinakulo&rsquo;s worldview, like other folk religious plays, remains as simple as that of a medieval morality play where absolute and certain is the victory of good over all forces of evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As popular but more numerous than the komedya and sinakulo are the playlets, which attest to the importance placed by the Spanish friars and the local priests that came after them on teaching Catholicism. Many religious playlets in the Philippines merely embellish the Catholic liturgy or dramatize more fully the feasts narrated by that liturgy, especially the events of Christ&rsquo;s birth, passion, death, and resurrection. Others are performed to honor saints on their feast days. Some of the most important playlets are associated with the Christmas season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tagalog <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a> (seeking entry) and Bikol <strong>kagharong</strong> (going from house to house) dramatize through a street procession the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph&rsquo;s search for an inn in Bethlehem on Christmas Eve. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> (shepherds), on the other hand, may either be a playlet depicting the journey of the shepherds, their encounter with Satan, and their adoration of the Christ Child, as may be seen in Cebu and Leyte; or may simply be a group of males and females in colorful costumes dancing and singing Spanish and native Christmas songs in front of different houses, as practiced in certain towns of Bicol. The <strong>ni&ntilde;os inocentes</strong> found in the Tagalog areas may be a short play showing the beheading of babies below two years of age as ordered by Herod, as was the custom in some towns of Rizal; or a parade of&nbsp;<em>higante&nbsp;</em>(giants) as in Gasan, Marinduque. Lastly, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/479\"><strong>tatlong hari</strong></a> (three kings) may be a simple procession highlighting three males costumed as kings, as in Floridablanca, Pampanga, and Mabitac, Laguna; or a play reenacting the search for and adoration of the Infant Jesus by the Three Kings on street and stage, as in Gasan, Marinduque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Lenten season, specifically the Holy Week, has many more playlets associated with it. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a> (hosanna), found in almost all Christian areas, features the blessing of the palms and reenacts Christ&rsquo;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/483\"><strong>via crucis</strong></a> (way of the cross), observed in most Catholic parishes, is a procession of the image of the Nazareno or Christ carrying the cross that stops at 14 altars where the Stations of the Cross are enshrined. In Paete, Laguna, the stations where Christ and his mother, and Christ and Veronica meet are dramatized with chanted dialogue and moving images. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/462\"><strong>paghuhugas</strong></a> (washing), performed in almost all Catholic and Aglipayan churches, dramatizes the washing of the feet of the apostles by Jesus on Maundy Thursday. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/455\"><strong>huling hapunan</strong></a> or <strong>ultima cena</strong> (last supper), staged in some Tagalog and Bicol provinces, reenacts the Last Supper with an actual dinner eaten by the priest and 12 men playing the apostles. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/474\"><strong>siete palabras</strong></a> (seven last words), observed in many Catholic parishes, features a life-sized image of Christ hanging on the cross which moves its head each time one of the seven last words is spoken&mdash;with accompanying thunder and lightning effects&mdash;during the three hours before Christ&rsquo;s death at 3:00 pm on Good Friday. The <strong>misericordia</strong> (mercy) procession of Pakil is the Good Friday procession enacting the burial of the dead Christ which stops at several&nbsp;<em>estaciones&nbsp;</em>(altars) where the image of the dead Christ is placed on a low platform and smoked with local incense. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>soledad</strong></a> (solitude), still done in Bicol and Pangasinan, is a procession of the image of the grieving Mater Dolorosa after the burial of her son on Good Friday or Black Saturday. This procession stops at designated houses where songs are performed to lighten Mary&rsquo;s sorrow. The <strong>pagkabuhay</strong> (resurrection) of Lubao, Pampanga, reenacts with special effects the Resurrection of Christ in the early hours of Easter Sunday. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> (meeting), also known as <strong>sugat</strong>, <strong>encuentro</strong>, <strong>sabet</strong>, <strong>alleluya</strong>, and <strong>padafung</strong> in Catholic and Aglipayan parishes all over the country, dramatizes the meeting of the Risen Christ and the Virgin on Easter Sunday morning in dance and song. This is climaxed by the removal of the Virgin&rsquo;s black veil by a little angel, who descends from the &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; of the four-poster&nbsp;<em>galile a</em>to sing &ldquo;Regina Coeli, Laetare&rdquo; (Queen of Heaven, Rejoice). The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/454\"><strong>hudas</strong></a>, found in Pampanga and Bulacan towns, shows the burning of the effigy of the traitor Iscariot. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/459\"><strong>moriones</strong></a> (helmets) of the Marinduque parishes dramatizes the story of the Roman soldier Longhino who, while guarding the tomb of Christ, witnesses the Resurrection, becomes a Christian, proclaims Christ&rsquo;s divinity, and is beheaded by Pilate&rsquo;s soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some playlets are performed in honor of patron saints. In Taal, Batangas, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>loa</strong></a> or verse poem is declaimed by youths to thank and praise San Martin of Tours and the Virgin of Caysaysay. To honor the Holy Cross during the month of May, the <strong>santakrusan</strong> is held, originally a procession that dramatizes the exaltation of the cross after it is found by Elena and Constantino. Similar in theme is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/448\"><strong>dotoc</strong></a> (journey) of Camarines Sur where costumed characters enact a journey of devotees to the Holy Land to adore the Holy Cross. But by far, the most important playlet performed on the feasts of some patron saints, such as Santiago Matamoros, is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/458\"><strong>moros y cristianos</strong></a>, popular in Manila and many towns all over the archipelago in the 19th century. Today, this dance drama survives in a few isolated towns. Known by different appellations, this playlet still dramatizes the conflict between Christians and Moors or non-Christians. Notable examples of this genre are the <strong>kinabayo</strong> of Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte, which depicts the conflict of the Moors and Christians in the Battle of Covadonga; the <strong>palo-palo</strong> of Ivana, Batanes, which survives as a dance with sticks between Moors and Christians; and the <strong>sayaw</strong> of Ibajay, Aklan, which underscores the defeat of the Moors in the hands of the Bisaya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The secular and religious plays and playlets are drastically different in content and function from the indigenous plays. While the latter depict the life and activities of the tribe, the dramas with Spanish influence either showcase alien stories of princes and princesses from ideal worlds peopled by the &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo; white race or narrate the life and sufferings of Jesus Christ and the saints of the Catholic Church, which were introduced into the country by the Spanish friars. Moreover, the komedya propagated and continues to propagate a colonial mentality that privileges the king and all figures of authority and looks up to the European as superior in race and religion while it looks down on the Moros as inferior by virtue of their religion. The plays and playlets on the life and sufferings of Jesus Christ and the saints discourage self-initiative, a critical attitude, and decisiveness, preferring to forge a passive will that bows to autocracy and its hierarchy of authority. It is thus not difficult to see how these plays contributed to the shaping of the native Filipino as colonial during the Spanish period and how they continue to discourage the development of persons and citizens in contemporary Philippine society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding to the needs of the times, some komedya and sinakulo have instituted changes in the content and form of these plays. The traditional komedya in San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque, found its first innovator in Max Allanigue, who wrote <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/646\"><strong>Prinsipe Rodante</strong></a></em></strong> (Prince Rodante), 1962, which uses all the conventions of the komedya but rejects its divisive anti-Muslim message and instead argues that a person&rsquo;s respect for justice and not his religion be the basis for judging that person. For his part, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>, in his <strong><em>Kalbaryo ng Maralitang Taga-lungsod</em></strong> (Calvary of the Urban Poor), 1988, reinterpreted the Christ story according to the problems faced by the urban poor in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduced into the country by Spanish artists in 1878 or 1879, the sarsuwela had its heyday during the American era from 1900 to 1940 in Manila and the provinces. Usually in three acts with music and dancing interspersed within the prose dialogue, the sarsuwela focuses on a love story between members of the upper classes that is spiced up with comic love episodes between servants and made more relevant with satirical attacks on usurers, corrupt politicians, oppressive landlords, lazy husbands whose husbandry is wasted on cockfighting and other vices and, lately, students hooked on drugs and &ldquo;Saudi&rdquo; recruiters who take advantage of naive workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original sarsuwela were created in the Tagalog region by writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2888\">Servando de los Angeles</a>, and composers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4198\">Fulgencio Tolentino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4008\">Juan S.

Principal obstacle to their love is a rich old man, Don Silvestre, who frequents the&nbsp;<em>kabaret&nbsp;</em>(dance hall) where the&nbsp;<em>dalagang bukid&nbsp;</em>sells flowers and is determined to get the girl for himself. Taking advantage of their addiction to cockfighting and card games, Don Silvestre lends Angelita&rsquo;s parents all the gambling money they want, certain that they would then easily agree to deliver the girl to him as payment for their debts. Moreover, Don Silvestre uses his money to make sure that Angelita wins the beauty contest that means so much to Angelita&rsquo;s parents. In the end, after a series of romantic misunderstanding and comic misinterpretations, Angelita is crowned queen but manages to sidestep Don Silvestre&rsquo;s trap by eloping with Cipriano, who has just finished his law studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional sarsuwela now survives mainly in the Ilocos, from where a few commercial troupes fan out to other <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>-speaking provinces for performances during town fiestas. These groups continue to stage stories such as those of veteran <strong>sarsuwelista</strong> Barbaro Paat. Typical of Paat&rsquo;s stories is one which depicts the plight of a wife who has been sent away by her husband and mother-in-law, and the sufferings of their young daughter under the father&rsquo;s new wife. Although its costumes are contemporary, Paat&rsquo;s sarsuwela has all the ingredients of popular traditional sarsuwela&mdash;namely, the love songs, the melodramatic scenes, and the comic scenes, which the audience loves above all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduced from Spain in the 19th century, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> (to be distinguished from the generic English term &ldquo;drama&rdquo;) is a play in verse and/or prose usually in one act. As written by Filipinos at the turn of the century, it often revolves around an aspect of Filipino contemporary life such as divorce, gambling, and other social vices, usually in the framework of a love story. During its golden age from 1900 to 1940, the drama was performed in a series of three-in-one performance or by itself before a sarsuwela. Like the sarsuwela, it was presented commercially or as a community activity on a proscenium stage in a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>teatro</strong></a> (theater) or on an open-air rural <strong>entablado</strong> (stage), using <strong>telon</strong> (theater curtain or backdrop) and appropriate props to denote setting. Although the drama is hardly ever staged today, it still enjoys immense popularity on radio, television or film, either as tear-jerking, sala-set melodrama popularly known as soap opera or as a comedy with a lot of slapstick or toilet humor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drama as a Philippine form could be one of three types, depending on its emphasis: <strong>drama romantiko</strong> or <strong>social</strong> (melodrama), <strong>drama komiko</strong> (comedy), or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\"><strong>drama simboliko</strong></a> (allegorical drama). The pre-World War II melodrama which aims to make people cry is typified by <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/684\"><strong>Veronidia</strong></a></em></strong>, 1919, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3152\">Cirio H. Panganiban</a>, which depicts the tragic death of a divorcee who only wants to visit her first husband who is now on his deathbed. The comedy, which entertains with laughter, is exemplified by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/665\"><strong><em>Sino Ba Kayo?</em></strong></a> (Who Are You All?), 1943, which weaves its hilarious situations around the mistaken identities of the main characters&mdash;a widower and his pretty daughter, a widow&mdash;the widower&rsquo;s new wife&mdash;and her handsome son who turns out to be the boyfriend of the widower&rsquo;s daughter, and the male and female servants. The drama simboliko, popular in Manila and its environs from 1900 to 1905 as a vehicle of political protest against American colonization of the archipelago, is exemplified by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2711\">Juan Abad</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/673\"><strong><em>Tanikalang Guinto</em></strong></a> (Golden Chain), 1902, and Aurelio V. Tolentino&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow), 1903.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong> is an allegory that chronicles the struggle of the Filipinos. Inangbayan (representing the motherland), under the leadership of Taga-ilog (the patriotic Filipino), attempts to overcome the oppressors in the country&rsquo;s history: the Chinese, the Spanish, and the Americans. Act 1 opens with Inangbayan reprimanding Asalhayop (Filipino collaborators) and his friends for feasting on the tombs of those who perished when Balintawak fell to the Chinese. Taga-ilog exhorts everyone to rise against Haring Bata, the Chinese king. For a fee, Asalhayop informs Haring Bata of the planned revolt but is exposed by Inangbayan and burned alive by Taga-ilog for his treachery. The Filipinos launch the revolt against the Chinese and win a signal victory. But another power comes to the islands: Dilat-na-bulag (Spain) and Matanglawin (Spanish colonial government), who have a blood compact with Taga-ilog. In act 2, the Halimau (Spanish friar) strips the natives of their little wealth. Taga-ilog defies him and is imprisoned. Ignoring Matanglawin&rsquo;s orders to release Taga-ilog, Halimau forces Inangbayan to surrender all her riches in exchange for Taga-ilog&rsquo;s freedom. Dahumpalay (Filipino collaborator) wants Taga-ilog shot but instead is killed by Taga-ilog, who burns the traitor&rsquo;s face and uses his clothes to escape from prison. Halimau orders Inangbayan buried alive, but the latter is liberated by the forces of Taga-ilog who finally overthrow the Spanish colonizers, even as the third colonial power, represented by Bagonsibol (America) and Malaynatin (the American insular government), arrive to pledge friendship with the Filipinos. Act 3 opens with women sewing the Philippine flag which will be raised when the new moon rises. Taga-ilog persuades Malaynatin to give the Filipinos their independence, but the latter is reluctant to do so. Malaynatin then falls asleep and in a dream sees Taga-ilog and his army preparing to fight America with cannons, air ships, and tanklike vehicles. In the end, Inangbayan begs for the country&rsquo;s independence but is refused. But when young children kneel before Bagonsibol in support of Inangbayan, Bagonsibol&rsquo;s heart softens and he grants the people freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the drama and the sarsuwela represent a significant development in Philippine theater history, if only because they pioneered a more realistic portrayal of Filipino life and culture, showcasing not only Filipino costumes and sets but also typical Filipino characters, dialogue, and situations. Moreover, unlike the colonial plays, these forms trained their sights on current issues of Philippine society, launching diatribes against those they perceived as social &ldquo;offenders.&rdquo; If these plays can be faulted, it would be for the simplistic way in which they solve the very real problems they present. Coincidences, accidents, and other forms of deus ex machina are used to eliminate all obstacles to come to a correct&mdash;not necessarily happy&mdash;ending for all concerned. By a stroke of the pen, the villains all mend their evil ways and become model members of the establishment church and community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; dramas, however, are an exception, because they dared to paint the bloody struggle of Filipinos against the American colonizers, hoping thus to enlighten and exhort the Filipino masses to support the revolutionary movement based in the mountains, and thus prevent colonization by another Western power. In doing this, the drama simboliko have come to represent a high point in the development of Philippine theater, reflecting the urgent conflicts of its time and encouraging the people to support the revolutionary movement in the countryside and prevent the second colonization of the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"american\" name=\"american\"></a>The American Traditions and Transformations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Short as it was, the American colonial regime from 1901 to 1946 had a profound effect on 20th-century Philippine theater, first in form and later in content and philosophy. This influence is seen in the Philippine bodabil (vaudeville), the Western plays presented in English or in Filipino translation or adaptation, and the original modern plays written in English by Filipino playwrights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Descended from the American vaudeville and introduced into the Philippines in the 1920s by artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\">Borromeo Lou</a>, bodabil is not a play per se but a potpourri of songs, dances, and comedy skits which showcase popular culture from the United States. Songs included <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779#the%20american%20era%20(1898-1945)\">jazz</a>, blues, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballads</a>, and local comic songs. Dances, performed by chorus girls or pairs of dancers, featured cakewalk, charleston, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/104\">tap dancing</a>, and jitterbug. Comedy skits were performed by local versions of Laurel and Hardy or Charlie Chaplin. Showing its circus origins, bodabil also featured magical acts, contortionists, animal tricks, fire and sword eaters. Stars of bodabil in the pre-World War II era were singers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a>, Hanasan, Diana Toy, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4045\">Cecil Lloyd</a> and musicians like Maestro Beck and the Alabama Brothers. The first bodabil shows were held at the Olympic Stadium, a boxing arena. But within two decades, many theaters, like the Savoy, Sirena, and Rivoli, were showing bodabil and movies which alternated with each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the Westernized educational system established by the Americans all over the archipelago, Filipinos were introduced to the first examples of &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; theater in the Philippines&mdash;that is, plays that have so-called artistic merit. In the 1930s and 1940s, prominent schools which were steeped in English language and Western culture, such as the University of the Philippines (UP) and Ateneo de Manila University, led in the production of Western classics, especially Shakespearean tragedies&mdash;namely, <strong><em>Macbeth</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong>, <strong><em><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></em></strong>, <strong><em>Julius Caesar</em></strong> &mdash;and comedies like <strong><em>Merchant of Venice</em></strong>, as well as then-contemporary Western plays written originally in English or in English translation. The latter included European and American plays that became popular in the United States from the late 19th century to the first three decades of the 20th, including Edmond Rostand&rsquo;s <strong><em>L&rsquo;Aiglon</em></strong> and <strong><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em></strong>, Anton Chekhov&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Marriage Proposal</em></strong>, George Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s <strong><em>Arms and the Man</em></strong>, and Broadway-type plays like W. W. Jacobs&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Monkey&rsquo;s Paw</em></strong>, George Middleton and Guy Bolton&rsquo;s <strong><em>Polly with a Past</em></strong>, Edward Bulwer-Lytton&rsquo;s <strong><em>Richelieu</em></strong>, George M. Cohan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Seven Keys to Baldpate</em></strong>, Mary Roberts Rinehart and Avery Hopwood&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Bat</em></strong>, James Barrie&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dear Brutus</em></strong>, A. A. Milne&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mr. Pim Passes By</em></strong>, and John Galsworthy&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Silver Box</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even as Filipinos were being Westernized by their formal education, Filipino playwrights began to write their own original plays in English, the language being then considered as the only legitimate language for literature and theater. Early playwrights include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\">Carlos P. Romulo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3280\">Vidal Tan,</a> and Jorge Bocobo, who in their youth wrote plays with historical subject matter, usually presented during Rizal Day celebrations, and later about contemporary characters and customs. The latter is typified by Vidal Tan&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Husband of Mrs. Cruz</em></strong>, which satirizes the elections and its effects on the people. But the major playwright in English of the pre-World War II period is doubtlessly <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a>, who wrote about the characters, values, and relationships of the middle class in both his tragedies and comedies. His first play in English, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/553\"><strong>Half an Hour in a Convent</strong></a></em></strong>, 1934, was followed by such important plays as <strong><em>Women Are Extraordinary</em></strong>, 1937; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/548\"><strong><em>Forsaken House</em></strong></a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/687\"><strong><em><strong>Wanted: A Chaperon</strong>e</em></strong></a>, 1940; <strong><em>Forever</em></strong>, 1941; and <strong><em>Condemned</em></strong>, 1944.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the komedya and sinakulo helped to Hispanize the natives in the Spanish period, so the bodabil and plays in English contributed to the rapid Americanization of the Filipinos in the first half of the 20th century. For one thing, bodabil and the Western plays presented in the country, although staged by Filipinos and for Filipinos, contained very little of Philippine life and culture in them. The bodabil had Filipino singers approximating American singers like Sophie Tucker, and flexing their limbs in the air &agrave; la Fred Astaire. In the same vein, the American and European plays had Filipinos imitating an English accent to be convincing in <strong><em>Macbeth</em></strong> or adopting an American twang to do justice to <strong><em>Polly with a Past</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, bodabil shows transported audiences to the American dreamland through the songs, dances, comedy skits, and production numbers on stage, while educated or Westernized Filipinos tried to get their catharsis from the characters of a Shakespeare play&mdash;an endeavor that did not always succeed since few Filipinos understood the idioms and culture of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time. Finally, because of their proven effectivity in Americanizing Filipinos, bodabil and Western contemporary plays certainly helped to make more acceptable to the Filipino America&rsquo;s continuing domination of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, as the Filipinos were becoming more Americanized in thought, taste, and temper by these and later plays, they were also being equipped with many dramatic theories and styles that opened new avenues for growth and later expanded the horizons for theatrical expression of Filipino playwrights, directors, actors, designers, and stage managers. Even as foreign plays strengthened the colonial bias, they also eventually enabled the Filipino to write and stage plays that represent Philippine realities with greater effectivity and fidelity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Japanese period from 1942 to 1945, the theater scene in Manila was dominated by the <strong>stage show</strong>, which now combined bodabil and the drama or the legitimate play. In this form, bodabil continued to dish out its bevy of songs, dances, and skits but with a more Filipino flavor, to be in consonance with the &ldquo;Asia for Asians&rdquo; policy of the colonizers. But the main attraction of the show was now the short traditional melodrama or modern straight play at the end of the show. The compromise between the commercial and the legitmate became possible and feasible because producers wanted to take advantage of the many movie talents, already names in the prewar period, who were now out of work because the Japanese had prohibited the further importation of film stock from abroad. Film actors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4662\">Leopoldo Salcedo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4602\">Fernando Poe</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4562\">Rosario Moreno</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4401\">Rosa del Rosario</a> topbilled plays at former movie theaters like Avenue, Ideal, and Capitol, which showcased mainly their acting abilities, since many of them could not sing even if they had become famous in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\"><strong>musicals</strong></a> where they lip-synched professional singers. These plays, like Guerrero&rsquo;s <strong><em>Forever</em></strong>, <strong><em>Condemned</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Forsaken House</em></strong>, and foreign plays like <strong><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em></strong>, were translated into Filipino for the benefit of the mass audiences and directed by film directors like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4386\">Gerardo de Leon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4346\">Manuel Conde</a> and designed by artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the artists in the stage shows were connected to the anti-Japanese guerrilla movement like the comedians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, so they devised skits that took potshots at the colonizers and their propaganda machine. One skit had a comedian read the newspapers upside down to get at the truth because newspapers under Japanese control always reversed the truth. Other actors ad-libbed lines to inform the audience of war developments or even sang songs like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/857\">&quot;Babalik Ka Rin&quot;</a>&nbsp;(You Will Return) to alert the mass audiences of the impending return of Gen Douglas MacArthur. In this way did bodabil indigenize itself by serving the needs of Filipinos desperately seeking liberation from a foreign fascistic regime. After the war, the return to popularity of the movies drove the stage show into small, cheap theaters or to open-air stages in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"period\" name=\"period\"></a>The Period of the Republics</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, America &ldquo;granted&rdquo; the Philippines its independence, inaugurating the first Republic of the Philippines, which had been prepared for by the Commonwealth and the first constitutional convention in 1935. But even as America relinquished direct rule over the country, it quickly reestablished its hold on the islands, turning it into a neocolony through treaties like the Bell Trade Act and the Laurel-Langley Agreement. And as America continued to control the country&rsquo;s economy and politics, it went on to dominate its culture through Hollywood films and American programs on radio and television, and more importantly, through the educational system, with the help of American-educated Filipino teachers and administrators, the American-inspired curricula, and the obligatory use of the English language as primary language of instruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raised in the Anglo-American tradition of theater, many local artists, understandably enough, continued the prewar practice of staging plays in English, which included the same Western classics like the plays of Shakespeare and now also Greek tragedies like <strong><em>Oedipus Rex</em></strong> and <strong><em>Antigone</em></strong>. In addition, they now staged modern plays from Europe like Emile Zola&rsquo;s <strong><em>Therese Raquin</em></strong>, Henrik Ibsen&rsquo;s <strong><em>Enemy of the People</em></strong> and <strong><em>Hedda Gabler</em></strong>, August Strindberg&rsquo;s <strong><em>Miss Julie</em></strong> and <strong><em>Dream Play</em></strong>, Chekhov&rsquo;s <strong><em>Three Sisters</em></strong>, <strong><em>Cherry Orchard</em></strong>, and <strong><em>The Seagull</em></strong>, as well as contemporary American plays such as Tennessee Williams&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Glass Menagerie</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</em></strong>, and Arthur Miller&rsquo;s <strong><em>Death of a Salesman</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Crucible</em></strong>, and <strong><em>All My Sons</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But with the rise of nationalism in the mid-1960s and the desire to connect to a larger audience, Filipino artists began to translate and/or adapt these foreign plays into Filipino. Among the early examples of such translations staged between 1968 and 1971 are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>&rsquo;s translations of <strong><em>The Glass Menagerie</em></strong> (<strong><em>Laruang Kristal</em></strong>), <strong><em>Death of a Salesman</em></strong> (<strong><em>Pahimakas sa Isang Ahente</em></strong>), and <strong><em>Enemy of the People</em></strong> (<strong><em>Kaaway ng Bayan</em></strong>); and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a>&rsquo;s (PETA) translations of <strong><em>The Visit</em></strong> (<strong><em>Donya Clara</em></strong>), <strong><em>Everyman</em></strong> (<strong><em>Tao</em></strong>), <strong><em>The Bald Soprano</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Tatay Mong Kalbo</em></strong>), <strong><em>The Inspector General</em></strong> (<strong><em>Inspektor Heneral</em></strong>), and <strong><em>Antigone</em></strong> (<strong><em>Antigone</em></strong>). An early example of a cultural adaptation is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3142\">Onofre Pagsanghan</a>&rsquo;s adaptation of Thornton Wilder&rsquo;s <strong><em>Our Town</em></strong> (<strong><em>Doon Po sa Amin</em></strong>), 1965, which reinterprets foreign settings and characters within Filipino realities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even as the translations and adaptations multiplied, Filipino playwrights continued to produce original works in English. From the prewar period, Guerrero restaged many of his early works and wrote even more plays like <strong><em>Perhaps</em></strong>, 1947; <strong><em>Deep in My Heart</em></strong>, 1951; and <strong><em>Our Strange Ways</em></strong>, 1953. These plays were staged by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3335\">UP Dramatic Club</a> and later the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3336\">UP Mobile Theater</a>, both of which Guerrero directed. At the Philippine Normal College, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a> followed suit, staging his own plays, including the full-length <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/590\"><strong>The Love of Leonor Rivera</strong></a></em></strong>, 1954, and the one-act plays <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/654\"><strong>Sabina</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/586\"><strong>The Ladies and the Senator</strong></a></em></strong>, and <strong><em>Parting at Calamba</em></strong>, all in 1953. Many of these plays were toured around the country by Montano&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2746\">Arena Theater</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The establishment of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5159\">Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards</a> in 1950 did so much to encourage the writing of original plays in English and helped discover playwrights in English like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2943\">Alberto Florentino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3161\">Jesus Peralta</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5535\">Wilfrido Nolledo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5030\">Estrella Alfon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3185\">Mar Puatu</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2780\">Antonio O.

To this generation too belonged Rolando Tinio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a Bonifacio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5522\">Virginia Moreno</a>. Starting 1953, the Palanca awards recognized playwrights in Filipino like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3230\">Dionisio Salazar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5372\">Amado V.

Virtusio</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5229\">Levy Balgos de la Cruz</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Influenced by the foreign works translated into Filipino that they had read in college and those they had seen in American films, Filipino playwrights created plays that were cast mainly in the style of Western realism, which sought to move the audience toward empathy with its well-rounded, flesh-and-blood characters. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\">Realism</a> from the 1950s to the early 1970s followed two tendencies: the psychological, which focuses on the problems of individuals, and the social, which situates and roots individual problems within the larger framework of a class society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outstanding psychological studies of character of this period were first found in English plays such as Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/677\"><strong>Three Rats</strong></a></em></strong>, 1948, which is about the affair between a woman and her husband&rsquo;s best friend which ends in the latter&rsquo;s death; Severino Montano&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sabina</em></strong>, about a Filipino woman who kills herself after being betrayed by her American lover; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\"><strong><em><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></em></strong></a>, 1955, which depicts the tragedy of two unmarried sisters in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/10/421\" icon-epa-sun=\"\">Intramuros</a> who are slowly being devoured by the growing commercialism and pragmatism under America, but who stubbornly cling to the genteel, albeit impractical, world of Hispanized culture; and Nestor Torre&rsquo;s <strong><em>And a Happy Birthday</em></strong>, 1967, which was influenced by the rebellious teenage characters played by American actor James Dean onscreen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1950s and 1960s, social realism slowly seeped into the modern Philippine stage as the country became more and more politicized toward the 1960s. A pioneer in this style was Alberto Florentino, as seen in his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/690\"><strong><em>The World Is an Apple</em></strong></a>, 1954, which focuses on how a poor man had to steal to buy medicine for his child. This play was later popularized in its Filipino translation. Not surprisingly perhaps, social and political issues were more evident in the Palanca plays written in Filipino, such as Agapito Joaquin&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bubungang Lata</em></strong> (Roofs of Tin), 1968, which is about characters whose poverty forces them to live in the cemetery; Rogelio Sikat&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/619\"><strong><em>Moses, Moses</em></strong></a>, 1968, the story of a schoolteacher who desperately seeks justice for the rape of her daughter by the mayor&rsquo;s son; and Wilfrido Pa. Virtusio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Vida</em></strong>, 1969, which focuses on the last hours of a farmer who is about to be electrocuted for the murder of an oppressive landlord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The First Quarter Storm that happened from Jan to Mar 1970, when activist groups came into open confrontation with the state police and military, ushered in a new chapter in the development of Philippine theater. Guided by the ideology of the National Democratic Front, theater groups such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3150\">Panday Sining</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>, and Kamanyang began to stage plays denouncing the three root evils of Philippine society: US imperialism, bureaucrat capitalism, and feudalism. Because of its mass orientation, these plays used Filipino to reach the widest audiences, performed in schools, theaters, public plazas, and strike areas, and denounced Marcos as a dictator and imperialist lackey. Famous and typical activist plays of the early 1970s are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/688\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong>Welga! Welga!</strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Strike! Strike!), <strong><em>Tunggalian</em></strong> (Rivalry), <strong><em>Hukumang Tuwad</em></strong> (Kangaroo Court), and <strong><em>Pasyon ni Juan de la Cruz</em></strong> (The Passion of Juan de la Cruz). In the same spirit, PETA staged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5197\">Isagani Cruz</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/555\"><strong>Halimaw</strong></a></em></strong> (Monster), 1971, which used allegory to allude to the rise of a fascist dictator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking advantage of the endless demonstrations and chaos caused by what he called communist organizations and wanting to extend his term beyond what was allowed by the 1935 Constitution, Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law on 21 Sep 1972, ushering in the Fourth Republic (1972-86). After putting his political enemies, media critics, left-leaning leaders behind bars, Marcos set out to establish his New Society by creating his own constitution; transforming the Philippine Armed Forces into his private army; establishing a legislature dominated by his own Kilusang Bagong Lipunan politicians; appointing his men to the Supreme Court; muzzling print media, radio, television, and film; and cruelly suppressing all forms of dissent coming from schools, cause-oriented groups, and foreign critics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under such strictures, theater artists either continued translating and adapting mostly foreign works, as Rolando Tinio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3065\">Antonio Mabesa</a> did through <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP)</a>, respectively; continued staging foreign plays, especially hits from Broadway and London&rsquo;s West End, as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2735\">Zeneida Amador</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines (Rep)</a> did; staged original Filipino works that dealt mainly with personal relationships and some social themes, as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2923\">Tony Espejo</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a> did; or created an activist theater that dealt with the oppressive conditions of martial law, imaginatively using styles that allowed artists to speak the truth without threat of censorship or imprisonment but always standing for the rights of the majority, as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory&nbsp;Company</a>&nbsp;and PETA and all its allied groups all over the country did.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believing that translating the Western classics into Filipino would enrich the national language, Teatro Pilipino, then resident company of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>, staged translations not only of the Western classics and modern plays that Tinio had translated before, but also a whole slew of classics of the Western theater such as Plautus&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Menaechmi</em></strong>, Carlo Goldoni&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Fan</em></strong> and <strong><em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Mistress of the Inn</em></strong>, Moliere&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Miser</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tartuffe</em></strong>, Gerhart Hauptmann&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Weavers</em></strong>, Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em></strong>, Albert Camus&rsquo;s <strong><em>Caligula</em></strong>, Max Frisch&rsquo;s <strong><em>Andorra</em></strong>, Alexei Arbuzov&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Promise</em></strong>, and John van Druten&rsquo;s <strong><em>I Am a Camera</em></strong>. At the University of the Philippines, DUP followed suit, running the gamut of Western plays and a few Asian plays, many of which were performed in both English and Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amador&rsquo;s Rep, on the other hand, concentrated on plays that got good reviews from their mostly upper middle-class audiences. Their plays included comedies like <strong><em>Barefoot in the Park</em></strong>, <strong><em>Plaza Suite</em></strong>, <strong><em>Blithe Spirit</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mornings at Seven</em></strong>, <strong><em>Don&rsquo;t Drink the Water</em></strong>, <strong><em>How the Other Half Lives</em></strong>, <strong><em>Private Lives</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Lettuce and Lovage</em></strong>, and musicals like <strong><em>The Sound of Music</em></strong>, <strong><em>Annie</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hello, Dolly!</em></strong>, <strong><em>My Fair Lady</em></strong>, <strong><em>Pippin</em></strong>, <strong><em>A Chorus Line</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Fiddler on the Roof</em></strong>. The same thrust was later followed by theater groups such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3328\">Triumphant People&rsquo;s Evangelistic Theater Society (Trumpets)</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2718\">Actors Actors</a>, 9 Works Theatrical, and Red Turnip, which were mostly founded by Rep alumni or English theater actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bulwagang Gantimpala was conceived as a theater group that would put on the boards the winners of the CCP Playwriting Contest, hence the name. Its first play, Bonifacio Ilagan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Katipunan: Mga <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ng Bayan</em></strong> (Katipunan: Sons of the People), 1978, about the Philippine Revolution of 1896, was followed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5209\">Jose Dalisay Jr</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sugatang Lawin</em></strong> (Wounded Hawk), 1978, about the meaning of heroism during the Japanese occupation; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2942\">Jomar Fleras</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kanser</em></strong> (Cancer), 1980, an adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Touch Me Not); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/558\"><strong>Hiblang Abo</strong></a></em></strong> (Strands of Gray), 1980, which portrays four tragic characters in a home for the aged; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5501\">Elsa Coscolluela</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>In Frailty&rsquo;s Grace</em></strong>, 1984.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other dramas of psychological realism performed during this period by other groups include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3113\">Orlando Nadres</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/642\"><strong>Paraisong Parisukat</strong></a></em></strong> (Square Eden), 1974, which shows how a young girl decides to sacrifice love and idealism to the banality of a stockroom assistant&rsquo;s life, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/556\"><strong><em>Hanggang Dito na Lamang at Maraming <strong>Salam</strong>at</em></strong> </a>(This Is as Far as I Go, and Many Thanks), 1974, a play about a closeted gay man who is rejected by the young man he is sending to school; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3127\">Bienvenido Noriega Jr</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/516\"><strong>Bayan-bayanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Little Country), 1975, which exposes the personal dreams and heartaches of Filipino expatriates in Switzerland; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/519\"><strong>Biyaheng Timog</strong></a></em></strong> (Trip to the South), 1984, which shows how an autocratic patriarch meddles in and destroys the lives of his children and how after his death, his children finally become whole as persons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The majority of theater artists in Manila and the regions, however, decided to create plays that tackled the social, economic, and political issues under martial law as they impacted on the majority of poor Filipinos. PETA led in the creation of a people&rsquo;s theater that had a Filipino and mass orientation through the plays it mounted and through the Basic Integrated Theater Arts Workshop it gave to all kinds of progressive organizations all over the archipelago. Influenced by Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s epic theater and later Augusto Boal&rsquo;s theater of the oppressed, the people&rsquo;s theater through the 14 years of martial law evolved into many styles in response to changing political conditions, the nature of the political action required, and the audiences that the plays needed to reach. To avoid censorship, many forms of people&rsquo;s theater consciously destroyed the illusion of theatrical reality, using folktales or historical events, and employing symbols, mime, dance, songs, stylized sets, costumes, props, and almost anything that would clarify and intensify sociopolitical and economic ideas for their audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History became a fecund source for plays that talked about the past in order to allude to the present. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4701\">Lito Tiongson</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Walang Kamatayang Buhay ni Juan de la Cruz Alyas &hellip;</em></strong> (The Deathless Life of Juan de la Cruz Alias &hellip;) depicted the techniques used by the Americans in the early 1900s to eradicate the revolutionary movement, including the torture and execution of&nbsp;<em>insurrectos&nbsp;</em>(insurgents), hamletting of villages to stop villagers from supporting the revolutionaries, and imposing curfews at night to control the movement of citizens. When the play was shown in 1976, the audience realized that the techniques of suppression under the Americans were no different from those under martial law. Other historical plays that were made to speak of the struggle against martial law were Bonifacio Ilagan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Langit Ma&rsquo;y Magdilim</em></strong> (Though the Sky Darkens), 1979, and <strong><em>Estados Unidos bersus Cruz, Abad at Tolentino</em></strong> (United States versus Cruz, Abad and Tolentino), 1981, both directed by Behn Cervantes for UP Repertory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The documentary style was also employed by some playwrights in order to establish the objectivity and strength of dramatic narratives that commented on conditions under martial law. Using narrators and slides of newspaper clippings, Al Santos&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/607\"><strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno Atbp. Kabanata</em></strong></a> (May 21 and Other Chapters), 1977, traced the life of Valentin de los Santos through three periods of struggle against colonial rule to explain why Tatang was obsessed with freedom and why it was wrong of Marcos to massacre the members of the Lapiang Malaya. A similar style was used for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3148\">Manny Pambid</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/527\"><strong>Canuplin</strong></a></strong></em></strong>, 1980, about the life of Canuto Francia who made a living as the local Charlie Chaplin in bodabil; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/601\"><strong><em>Mariang <strong>Aliw</strong></em></strong> </a>(Maria the Woman of Pleasure), 1983, which documented on stage the lives of actual prostitutes in the Malate district, to show that nothing had changed under the so-called New Society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/444\">Brechtian</a> style, with touches of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/440\">absurdism</a>, is evident in Al Santos&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/666\"><strong><em>Ang Sistema ni Propesor Tuko</em></strong></a> (Professor Gecko&rsquo;s Way), 1980, which pokes fun at the authoritarian rule of a fascistic professor in order to comment on Philippine society under the Marcos regime; and Rolando S. Tinio&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/605\"><strong>May Katwiran ang Katwiran</strong></a></em></strong> (Reason Has Its Reason), 1972, which shows how a landlord manipulates a peasant&rsquo;s simple mind for the latter to accept the landlord&rsquo;s superiority. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\">Chris Millado</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/562\"><strong><em>Ilokula II</em></strong></a>, 1983, staged by Tropang Bodabil, presents, in absurd bodabil fashion, the ailing president/economy of the country, which has to be propped up with infusions of blood/cash from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typical of the inexpensive, portable, and short plays called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/481\"><strong>tula-dula</strong></a> (poem-play), which were evolved for symposia or rallies, is one acting out <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a>&rsquo;s poem <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/611\">&quot;Ang mga Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan de la Cruz&quot;</a>&nbsp;(The Amazing Adventures of Juan de la Cruz), 1975, which narrates one day in the life of an ordinary Filipino who realizes that wherever he may go he has no real rights. Richie Valencia and Ed Vencio&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/569\"><strong><em>Mga Unang Araw sa Buhay ng <strong>Iskolar ng Bayan</strong></em></strong></a> (First Few Days in the Life of a New Scholar of the People), 1976, which narrates one day in the life of a UP student, was followed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/680\"><strong><em><strong>Titser</strong> ng Bayan</em></strong></a> (People&rsquo;s Teacher), which recounts the problems of the Filipino teacher, from low salaries to colonial education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brechtian techniques were also used for full-blown musicals, which may be <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a> or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">pop</a> musicals</strong> on contemporary themes. Featuring a band of rock singers and musicians on a separate platform and a group of dancers-actors-singers on stage, Al Santos and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/626\"><strong><em>Nukleyar!</em></strong></a> (Nuclear!), 1983, strings together songs, dances, and slides that explain nuclear reaction, exposes the horrors unleashed by the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and finally attacks the establishment for the overpriced and unsafe Bataan nuclear plant in the Philippines. Another important musical is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2889\">Dong de los Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bien Aligtad</em></strong>, which describes the necessary evolution of a simple slum dweller into a notorious criminal because of police corruption and military violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Important achievements in the successful use of ethnic performing, visual, and literary arts to convey the problems of Mindanao like insurgency, militarization, landlordism, exploitation of indigenous communities, and landgrabbing are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2953\">Rodulfo Galenzoga</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/600\"><strong>Maranatha</strong></a></em></strong> (Make Haste, Lord), 1974, which uses an old Lanao tale about a big, black, predatory bird, to expose corruption of politicians and the growing militarization in Mindanao; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3214\">Frank Rivera</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/613\"><strong>Mga Kuwentong Maranao</strong></a></em></strong> (Maranao Tales), 1974, which uses the <strong>bayok</strong> (debate in chant) tradition, the&nbsp;<em>kapamalong-malong&nbsp;</em>(dance with the tubular skirt called&nbsp;<em>malong</em>), and the Pilandok character of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> culture to comment on capricious and abusive rulers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the significant progress in research into Philippine traditional forms, some companies resurrected these forms and revitalized them with contemporary sociopolitical messages. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2761\">Dulaang Babaylan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Sinakulo</strong></em></strong>, 1973, pioneered the use of the passion play to comment on the commercialism brought about by the dominance of multinational companies in the Philippines. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5785\">Virgilio Vitug</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sinakulo ning Balen</em></strong> (Passion Play of the Nation), 1983, as presented in Lubao, Pampanga, unveils a new Christ: Jesus Makabalen, who condemns fiscals who accept bribes, fake recruiters who victimize hapless peasants, candle sellers who commercialize the blessing of the pope, and government officials who are insensitive to the needs of the people. Although his enemies succeed in crucifying him, Jesus rises again through the ordinary people who decide to continue his struggle. PETA&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/541\"><strong>Dupluhang Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Poetic Joust), 1975, became a debate between workers and peasants that ended in an expos&eacute; of the cause of poverty in the country. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/640\"><strong><em><strong>Panunuluyan</strong> nina Birheng Maria at San Jose</em>&hellip;</strong></a> (The Search for an Inn by the Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph&hellip;), 1979, showed the holy couple coming down from their<em>karo</em>(processional float) and being led by a young Jesus to different poor communities in Metro Manila. Meanwhile, because of its enduring popularity among Filipinos, the sarsuwela was successfully updated as in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/525\"><strong>Ang Bundok</strong></a></em></strong> (The Mountain), 1976, which showed the harassment of the Igorot by foreign speculators digging for gold in the Cordilleras and the unity the mountain people forged to fight their oppressors; and in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907), 1982, which portrayed the conflict between Filipinos and Americans in politics, economy, and culture at the beginning of American colonization to reflect the beginnings of imperialism in the country. Finally, the oldest of all traditional drama, the <strong>mass</strong>, was given new meaning in one of the most popular protest plays of the 1970s. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/638\"><strong><em><strong>Pagsamba</strong>ng Bayan</em></strong></a> (A People&rsquo;s Veneration), 1977, by Bonifacio Ilagan reinterpreted Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice, the parables of the New Testament and the priesthood itself, according to the problems of the peasants and workers at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some plays successfully blended realistic and nonrealistic styles. <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/573\"><strong>Juan Tamban</strong></a></em></strong>, 1978, focused on the street urchin Juan Tamban, who ate roaches and lizards. In this play, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a> used a chorus as narrator and commentator to tie together a series of highly realistic and moving episodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the assassination of Marcos&rsquo;s archenemy Benigno Aquino Jr in Aug 1983, the tide of protest against the dictatorship reached new heights. Theater artists, like many progressive Filipinos, became bolder in expressing their protest against the decadent and dying regime. It was then that certain plays were able to use realism. Chris Millado&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/526\"><strong>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</strong></a></em></strong> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major), 1985, showed in monologues and dialogues the politicization of two brothers (a farmer and worker), a socialite, a priest and a tribal woman, a student activist, and a teacher. After the triumph of the EDSA Revolt in 1986, PETA was able to stage <strong><em>Panata sa <strong><strong>Kala</strong></strong>yaan</em></strong> (Oath to Freedom), 1986, at the Main Theater of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, symbolically showing how the people&rsquo;s theater had breached the bastion of colonial and elitist culture under Imelda Marcos. The play was a comprehensive narrative of the Filipino&rsquo;s experiences under martial law ending in the EDSA Revolt, using a whole range of theater styles evolved during and because of the martial law period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the dictator Marcos and his family were ousted from power, the era of the Fifth Republic (1986 onward) began. Radical changes were seen in the cultural sector. CCP established new thrusts toward, among others, Filipinization&mdash;that is, the prioritization of Filipino original works and artists in programs, grants, and venues; democratization, meaning equal opportunities for support and exposure for artists of all sectors and wider access to CCP venues and products; and decentralization, meaning the active participation of regional artists in the creation of works from the region and the definition of a national culture. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, created through Republic Act 7356 and passed in 1992, established a comprehensive program to protect and support the arts. Additional support for artists came in the form of literary and playwriting contests, as well as the National Centennial Commission contests held in 1998 to commemorate the decade of Philippine nationalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translations and adaptations of foreign plays continue to be part of the regular seasons of companies like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>, PETA, and DUP. As in previous periods, foreign plays translated into Filipino come mainly from Europe and the United States, such as Moliere&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Miser</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Kuripot</em></strong>), Jean Genet&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Balcony</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Balkonahe</em></strong>), Maxim Gorky&rsquo;s <strong><em>Lower Depths</em></strong> (<strong><em>Lusak</em></strong>), Manuel Puig&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mystery of the Rose Bouquet</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Misteryo ng Pumpon ng <strong><strong>Rosas</strong></strong></em></strong> ), Pierre Choderlos de Laclos&rsquo;s <strong><em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em></strong> (<strong><em>Juego de Peligro</em></strong>), Arthur Miller&rsquo;s <strong><em>All My Sons</em></strong> (<strong><em>Sa Ngalan ng Anak</em></strong>), and Eugene O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Iceman Cometh</em></strong> (<strong><em>Pagdating ng <strong>Daluyong</strong></em></strong>). After 1986, there is a marked increase in the translation or adaptation of plays from Asia, such as Shusako Endo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Golden Country</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ginintuang Bayan</em></strong>), Shundraka&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Little Clay Cart</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Munting Laruang Kariton)</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Mahabharata</em></strong> (<strong><em>Ang Nawalang Kapatid</em></strong>), and <strong><em>Ramayana</em></strong> (<strong><em>Rama at Sita</em></strong>). Moreover, many foreign classics are not only translated but adapted to Filipino situations, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Arbol de Fuego</em></strong>, which sets Chekhov&rsquo;s <strong><em>Cherry Orchard</em></strong> to Negros during martial law; <strong><em>D&rsquo; Wonder Twins of Boac</em></strong>, which situates Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em>Twelfth Night</em></strong> during the dark days of the film industry in the 1960s; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4839\">Elmer Gatchalian</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Juego de Peligro</em></strong>, which adapts <strong><em>Les Liaisons Dangereuses</em></strong> to Spanish colonial Philippines; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3206\">Jerry Respeto</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Birheng Matimtiman</em></strong>, which sets Niccolo Machiavelli&rsquo;s <strong><em>La Mandragola</em></strong> in Pakil, Laguna, at the end of the 19th century. Similarly, there is considerable increase in stage adaptations of local epics like <strong><em>Ang Paglalakbay ni Radiya Mangandiri: Isang Pilipinong Ramayana</em></strong> (The Journey of Rajah Mangandiri: A Filipino Ramayana); Filipino literary pieces like <strong><em>Ang mga Huwad</em></strong> from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5405\">F. Sionil Jose</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1795\"><strong><em>The Pretenders</em></strong></a>; and Filipino films like <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></em></strong> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays of psychological realism come in the form of the straight plays. Focusing on Filipino individuals are plays like Tony Perez&rsquo;s trilogy on relationships: <strong><em>Saan Ba Tayo Ihahatid ng Disyembre?</em></strong> (Where Will December Bring Us?), <strong><em>Oktubre, Nang Tayo&rsquo;y Nagmamahalan Pa</em></strong> (October, When We Were Still in Love), and <strong><em>Nobyembre, Noong Akala Ko&rsquo;y Mahal Kita</em></strong> (November, When I Thought I Love You). Earlier, his <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/651\"><strong>Sa North Diversion Road</strong></a></em></strong> (On the North Diversion Road), 1988, had two actors acting out the roles of different married couples and their various reactions to marital infidelity. Elsa Martinez-Coscoluella&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/564\"><strong><em>In My Father&rsquo;s House</em></strong></a>, 1987, depicts the slow disintegration of the members of a Cebuano family during the Japanese occupation of Negros island in the 1940s. Three monologues on different types of love that cause cardiac arrest are the subject of three monologues in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3175\">Nick Pichay</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tres Ataques de Corazon</em></strong> (Three Heart Attacks), 2006. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3087\">Glenn Mas</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/549\"><strong>Games People Play</strong></a></em></strong>, 2013, is about three characters who get to understand the traumas of their childhood through the guessing game&nbsp;<em>pitik-bulag</em>. In 2015, Kanakan Balintagos staged the revised <strong><em>Mga Buhay na Apoy</em></strong> (A Breath of Fire), about a woman who must come to terms with the trauma of rape in her youth and her ethnic origins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays of social realism continue to proliferate in this period. Repressed for years, the traumatic experiences under martial law have expressed themselves in plays like Nick Pichay&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/566\"><strong>Isang Araw sa Karnabal</strong></a></em></strong> (A Day in the Carnival), 2010, and<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\"> Ed Maranan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>EJ: Ang Pinagdaanang Buhay nina Evelio Javier at Edgar Jopson</em></strong> (EJ: The Lives of Evelio Javier and Edgar Jopson), 2008. The corruption in government which has increased by leaps and bounds is the subject matter of Malou Jacob&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/504\"><strong>Anatomiya ng Korupsyon</strong></a></em></strong> (Anatomy of Corruption), 1992; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2802\">Layeta Bucoy</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/540\"><strong>Doc Resureccion: Gagamutin ang Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (Doc Resureccion: Will Heal the Nation), 2009, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/685\"><strong>Walang Kukurap</strong></a></em></strong> (Let No One Blink), 2012; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3193\">Floy Quintos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/544\"><strong><em>Evening at the Opera</em></strong></a>, 2011. Poverty and the exploitation of the poor are the subject of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/674\"><strong>Taong Grasa</strong></a></em></strong> (Tramp), 1985, a monologue by a homeless man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some plays successfully blend realistic and non-realistic styles. Anton Juan Jr&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/537\"><strong>Death in the Form of a Rose</strong></a></em></strong>, 1992, intersperses realistic scenes with choral passages using masks and symbols, in order to dramatize the &ldquo;execution&rdquo; of Paolo Passolini at the hands of the &ldquo;establishment.&rdquo; Juan&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/559\"><strong><em>Mga Hinabing Pakpak ng Ating Mga Anak</em></strong></a> (The Woven Wings of Our Children), 2008, is about child labor. The suppression of tribal rights is the concern of Malou Jacob&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/593\"><strong>Macli-ing</strong></a></em></strong>, 1988.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many straight plays have focused on historical themes, some because of the &ldquo;decade of nationalism.&rdquo; These include Rene Villanueva, Malou Jacob, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tonio, Pepe, at Pule</em></strong> (Tonio, Pepe, and Pule), 1990; Jacob, Villanueva, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3141\">Nonon Padilla</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Teresa, Gregoria, at Teodora</em></strong> (Teresa, Gregoria, and Teodora), 1993; Nick Pichay&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dalawang Buhay ni Plaridel</em></strong> (Two Lives of Plaridel), 2000; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2867\">Tim Dacanay</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Teatro Porvenir</em></strong>, 2013; and Floy Quintos&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/499\"><strong>&hellip;&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>And St. Louis Loves Dem Filipinos</em></strong></a>, 1992.

A wealth of original musicals came out in these decades, some in celebration of the &ldquo;decade of nationalism.&rdquo; Among these are the musicals with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a> as composer&mdash;namely, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/581\"><strong><em>Katy!: The <strong>Musical</strong></em></strong></a>, 1988; Noel Balmaceda&rsquo;s <strong><em>Alikabok</em></strong> (Dust), 1995; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/625\"><strong><em>Noli Me Tangere</em></strong></a>, 1995; Jovy Miroy&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></strong></em></strong> (Subversion), 1996; and Paul Dumol&rsquo;s <strong><em>Aguinaldo 1899: Ang Pagpatay kay Luna</em></strong> (Aguinaldo 1899: The Murder of Luna), 1998.

The &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; drama of nationalist playwright Aurelio V. Tolentino, <strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow), was revived and reinterpreted several times in the last two decades. One of the most successful productions of KNB was that of Chris Millado, 1990, which reinterpreted the main protagonist Taga-ilog as a tattooed native datu, a Bonifacio-type revolutionary, and a contemporary New People&rsquo;s Army fighter. The komedya was revitalized in content and form by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3251\">Jonas Sebastian</a>&rsquo;s stage adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Florante</strong></strong> at Laura</em></strong></a> (Florante and Laura), 1992.

For one, this theater has finally come into its own, at least as far as subject matter is concerned. An amazing range of characters, all painstakingly portrayed as individuals or types&mdash;from salesgirls, peasants, and factory workers to landed gentry and basketball stars, from boxers and slum dwellers to social workers, and historical characters from <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a> to Valentin de los Santos&mdash;all move and speak in situations that almost always ring true. Urgent too are many of the issues that these plays speak about&mdash;the danger of nuclear warfare, the exploitation of farmers by landlords, the boredom and heartaches of Filipino expatriates, the dilemmas faced by personalities in Philippine history, the violation of basic human rights among the poor and the powerless, the enlightenment of students and social workers about the world outside of the academe, the massacre of the Lapiang Malaya. Slowly but surely, Philippine theater is finally coming to fulfill the most basic expectations of a national theater&mdash;the perspicacious interpretation of the many realities Filipinos struggle with; the vital expression of the Filipino&rsquo;s needs, concerns, and aspirations; and the use of dramatic styles that are rooted in Philippine ethnic or folk traditions and/or enriched by foreign dramatic contributions.<br />\r\nAs these needs, expressions, aspirations, and dramatic styles coincide more and more with those of the majority of Filipinos and of the nation as a whole, the closer will this theater grow toward becoming a truly national theater by and for all Filipinos.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><em><strong>Written by Nicanor G.

This part ends with the babalyan letting out a scream and pulling the ceremonial staff attached to the ceiling to denote that Mangindusa has departed. Soon after, the babalyan, also in a similar skirt and blouse but with a black hood covering her face, works herself into a trance as she sips wine and throws herself in the middle of the room.

The most important dance among most Philippine indigenous groups, however, is the war dance. The war dance of the Higaonon or Northern Bukidnon of Mindanao imitates the movements of warriors who fight with spears and shields. Similarly, proto-dramas are the dances which are playful imitations of animals, like the monkey, fish, and fly dances of the Aeta of Zambales in Luzon; the hawk dances of the Higaonon in Mindanao; and the butterfly, monkey, and bird dances of the Tausug and <a href=\"/1/2/2371\">Sama Dilaut</a> in Sulu."

Of the courtship customs, the most common is the debate between a male and a female that may employ verse, song, and dance. The <a href=\"/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> <strong>panonoroon</strong> has a boy and a girl chanting metaphorical verses to each other, with the boy offering his love to the girl and the latter warding off his verbal advances. The <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> <a href=\"/7/55/442\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a> features antiphonal songs performed by male and female who talk not only of love but also of the problems faced by married couples and rural workers. Among the <a href=\"/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, the&#xA0;<strong><a href=\"/7/55/452\">duplo</a></strong> or debate in song and dance becomes an exchange of spoken verses.

Similarly, the <a href=\"/6/46/95\"><strong>singkil</strong></a> dance of the Maranao enacts an episode from the epic <strong><em><a href=\"/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></em></strong>, where Prince Bantugan saves the princess Gandingan from the evil mountain spirits who try to stop the couple by hurling trees on Bantugan&#x2019;s path and opening up the earth to swallow Gandingan.

Furthermore, they help fulfill the basic needs of the tribe for a good harvest, victory in war, and the physical and spiritual well-being of their sick, their newborns, their youth, and their newlyweds. Finally, these plays create a stronger bond among the members of the tribe and bind them to work for the common good. Rituals of baptism, circumcision, and marriage, as well as the dances that instruct children on the techniques of looking for honey, fishing, or fighting in war clearly work for the collective good. A good harvest, as well as plentiful honey and fish obviously benefit the tribe, while the display of war dances teaches young boys their primary duty as men&#x2014;namely, fighting off aggressors to ensure the survival of the tribe. Similarly, the customs associated with courtship, marriage, and death provide a way of expressing personal emotions in a socially accepted manner and of informing all of new ties that will have to be respected by everyone so that harmony may reign in their society."

As performed in Pe&#xF1;aranda, Nueva Ecija, in 1986, the story of the arakyo remains basically what it was at the turn of the century when this play, also known as <strong>tibag</strong>, first became popular. After his father, King Constancio of Rome and Constantipole, is killed by the Turks, the young Constantino sits on the throne and brings war to the&#xA0;<em>emperador&#xA0;</em>(emperor) of Turquia to avenge his father&#x2019;s death. Worried about the outcome of the war, Elena is assured by a voice from heaven that victory would be given to Constantino, but that he and Elena should in turn look for the cross on which Christ died.

Meanwhile, Queen Elena has found the cross but loses it to the Moors who intercept and attack her. Informed of this, Constantino sends Lucero on a mission to Turquia to demand that Costroas give back the cross. The mission fails, but it brings Lucero face-to-face with Ordelisa once again. The general pledges his undying love for the Moorish princess and proves it by laying down his arms. But the other Moors pounce on, imprison, and sentence him to death by beheading. Ordelisa, who is now convinced of Lucero&#x2019;s love, decides to free him. In the end, a big battle is waged between the Christians led by Constantino and Elena, and the Moors under Costroas and Ordelisa. Elena is about to kill Ordelisa when Lucero intervenes and begs for her life. Defeated, the Moors agree to be baptized &#x201C;so that the dirt of their souls may be washed away.&#x201D;"

Also called <strong><em>Yawa-Yawa</em></strong> (literally, Devil-Devil), this komedya tells the story of how Lusbel rebelled against God and how God ordered San Miguel Arcangel (Iligan City&#x2019;s patron saint) to quell the heavenly revolts and drive Lusbel, his cohorts, and the Seven Capital Sins, represented by a huge seven-headed monster, to hell where they are punished forever for their pride and rebelliousness."

The plays and playlets on the life and sufferings of Jesus Christ and the saints discourage self-initiative, a critical attitude, and decisiveness, preferring to forge a passive will that bows to autocracy and its hierarchy of authority.

For a fee, Asalhayop informs Haring Bata of the planned revolt but is exposed by Inangbayan and burned alive by Taga-ilog for his treachery. The Filipinos launch the revolt against the Chinese and win a signal victory. But another power comes to the islands: Dilat-na-bulag (Spain) and Matanglawin (Spanish colonial government), who have a blood compact with Taga-ilog. In act 2, the Halimau (Spanish friar) strips the natives of their little wealth. Taga-ilog defies him and is imprisoned. Ignoring Matanglawin&#x2019;s orders to release Taga-ilog, Halimau forces Inangbayan to surrender all her riches in exchange for Taga-ilog&#x2019;s freedom.

Act 3 opens with women sewing the Philippine flag which will be raised when the new moon rises. Taga-ilog persuades Malaynatin to give the Filipinos their independence, but the latter is reluctant to do so. Malaynatin then falls asleep and in a dream sees Taga-ilog and his army preparing to fight America with cannons, air ships, and tanklike vehicles. In the end, Inangbayan begs for the country&#x2019;s independence but is refused.

Although his enemies succeed in crucifying him, Jesus rises again through the ordinary people who decide to continue his struggle.

				"value": "With the realization among theater scholars and critics that traditional forms of drama still popular among the masses should not only be studied but be imbued as well with positive contemporary messages, urban playwrights have revitalized traditional forms to comment on contemporary issues and concerns. The &#x201C;seditious&#x201D; drama of nationalist playwright Aurelio V. Tolentino, <strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow), was revived and reinterpreted several times in the last two decades. One of the most successful productions of KNB was that of Chris Millado, 1990, which reinterpreted the main protagonist Taga-ilog as a tattooed native datu, a Bonifacio-type revolutionary, and a contemporary New People&#x2019;s Army fighter. The komedya was revitalized in content and form by <a href=\"/7/60/3251\">Jonas Sebastian</a>&#x2019;s stage adaptation of <a href=\"/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/9/78/1871\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Florante</strong></strong> at Laura</em></strong></a> (Florante and Laura), 1992. New sarsuwela that won in the sarsuwela division of the Centennial Literary Prize included Mario O&#x2019;Hara and Minda Azarcon&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/639\"><strong>Palasyo ni Valentin</strong></a></em></strong> (Valentin&#x2019;s Palace), 1998; Bienvenido Lumbera and Lucien Letaba&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/557\"><strong>Hibik at Himagsik nina Victoria Laktaw Atbp.</strong></a></em></strong> (Plea and Revolt of Victoria Laktaw and Others), 2002; <a href=\"/7/7/2874\">George de Jesus III</a> and <a href=\"/4/26/4517\">Jesse Lucas</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Paglayang Minamahal</em></strong> (Beloved Freedom), 2000; and Melba Maggay and <a href=\"/5/5/4162\">Lucio San Pedro</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Bayan, Isang Paa na Lamang</em></strong> (Nation: Just One Foot Left), 2002."

				"value": "Modern Philippine dramas display a vitality and urgency that surprise theater enthusiasts of whatever background. For one, this theater has finally come into its own, at least as far as subject matter is concerned. An amazing range of characters, all painstakingly portrayed as individuals or types&#x2014;from salesgirls, peasants, and factory workers to landed gentry and basketball stars, from boxers and slum dwellers to social workers, and historical characters from <a href=\"/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a> to Valentin de los Santos&#x2014;all move and speak in situations that almost always ring true. Urgent too are many of the issues that these plays speak about&#x2014;the danger of nuclear warfare, the exploitation of farmers by landlords, the boredom and heartaches of Filipino expatriates, the dilemmas faced by personalities in Philippine history, the violation of basic human rights among the poor and the powerless, the enlightenment of students and social workers about the world outside of the academe, the massacre of the Lapiang Malaya. Slowly but surely, Philippine theater is finally coming to fulfill the most basic expectations of a national theater&#x2014;the perspicacious interpretation of the many realities Filipinos struggle with; the vital expression of the Filipino&#x2019;s needs, concerns, and aspirations; and the use of dramatic styles that are rooted in Philippine ethnic or folk traditions and/or enriched by foreign dramatic contributions.<br />\nAs these needs, expressions, aspirations, and dramatic styles coincide more and more with those of the majority of Filipinos and of the nation as a whole, the closer will this theater grow toward becoming a truly national theater by and for all Filipinos.&#xA0;&#xA0;<span class>&#xA0;</span>"

The variety of these gods is as endless as they are intriguing, but typical would be the gods of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> in the late 16th century&mdash;namely, Bachtala, also known as Mulayri, creator and preserver of everything; Lacanbaco, god of the fruits of the earth; Oinon Sana, god of the fields and the mountains; Lacapati, giver of water to the fields and fish to the fisher; Hayc, god of the wind, storms, and squalls at sea; and the moon, adored when new, giver of wealth and long life. The Tagalog also revered their&nbsp;<em>nuno&nbsp;</em>(spirits of their ancestors), who hovered in the air, inflicting or taking away the illnesses of the people (Quirino and Garcia 1958, 419-22).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to communicate with the gods and spirits, special mediums are required. These shamans or priests/priestesses are privileged, as they often double as herb doctors, seers, and tribal councilors. They are called by various names: babaylan,&nbsp;<em>tambalan</em>,&nbsp;<em>mambunong</em>,&nbsp;<em>mumbaki</em>,&nbsp;<em>marayawan</em>,&nbsp;<em>manalisig</em>,&nbsp;<em>bayoc</em>, and only later,&nbsp;<em>arbularyo</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many types of rituals, but the ritual which is drama is the one where the shaman goes into a trance, possessed by the spirit he/she is calling. At the climax of the trance, the shaman takes a spear or a knife and kills the sacrificial animal, which may be a chicken, pig, or carabao, depending on the gravity of the spirit&rsquo;s anger or the urgency of the request. With the shaman playing the role of the god, often even assuming the movements and speech of the same, and the animal the part of the supplicant, the sacrifice clearly symbolizes the slaying of the supplicant by the spirit. Through the centuries, and even up to the present, this type of ritual&mdash;known in different parts of the archipelago as <strong>pag-aanito</strong>, <strong>anituan</strong>, <strong>anito-baylan</strong>, <strong>bunong</strong>, <strong>pagdiwata</strong>, <strong>pag-anyo</strong>, <strong>marayaw</strong>, <strong>dawak</strong>, and <strong>baki</strong>, among others&mdash;has been performed for various purposes such as for healing the sick, ensuring a good harvest or victory in war, hunting, controlling pestilence, protecting a newborn, initiating a young child, and blessing a marriage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1890, the German traveler Meyer (1975a, 1975b) described a healing ritual among the Igorot. The Igorot believe that sickness is caused by an&nbsp;<em>anito&nbsp;</em>who is angry because of duties or obligations that have not been met. According to Meyer, if the sickness worsens, they hold a ritual, where the mambunong kills the pig and uses its blood to anoint the forehead and cheeks of the relatives of the sick person. The blood cannot be washed away till the person recovers or dies. Today, this ritual structure is preserved in the <strong>baboy</strong> (pig) of the Talaingod, where the shaman butchers a pig to ask help from the&nbsp;<em>diwata&nbsp;</em>to cure the sick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variation of this ritual has the shaman dancing to scare the sickness away. Among the Aeta of Nabuklod, Floridablanca, the sick people sit on the ground in a row and are covered with a long red cloth representing the sickness from which they suffer. As the native guitar plays, the&nbsp;<em>manganito&nbsp;</em>(priests) dance and frighten the sickness-causing spirits away with a bolo or offer them food on a banana leaf or even bead necklaces to persuade them to leave the infirm. At the end of the dance, the red cloth is slowly pulled away to denote the departure of the malignant spirits. If, after these rituals, the sick do not get well, the Aeta believe that they do not deserve to get well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rituals connected with the harvest usually involve a sacrifice as a sign of thanksgiving. In the <strong>hinaklaran</strong> of the Bukidnon groups in Mindanao, an altar of bamboo and&nbsp;<em>dongla&nbsp;</em>(red ti plant) is erected in an open field and laden with offerings of betel nut, rice wine, rice cakes, candles, and a red cloth to please the gods. The head babaylan chants the&nbsp;<em>pag-ampo&nbsp;</em>(prayers) to Evavasok, goddess of the harvest season, thanking her for the harvest. Later, three or four women join her in the chant and in the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/54\">dugso</a>&nbsp;</em>(dance), where the women hold hands and stamp their feet as they go around the altar. The six-hour ritual reaches its climax when Evavasok possesses the head babaylan and through her sips the wine that is proof and product of a good harvest. Similar to this ritual is the <strong>hinang</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2329\">Agusan Manobo</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sacrifices are offered as well to prevent or control natural or human-made disasters such as the destruction of the harvest, enemy attacks, and epidemics like chicken pox, typhoid fever, and diarrhea. When lightning strikes a field or when a falling star shoots across the sky, the Igorot believe that Kabunyan is angry and may punish them for some evil deeds. To avert this punishment, the shaman butchers a pig and impales the pig&rsquo;s head on a bamboo stick at the place hit by lightning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rituals have often been performed during rites of passage. In 1608, Domingo Perez described a baptism ritual among the Zambal (Perez 1973, 303). When the Zambal child reaches a certain age, the parents hold a pag-aanito to initiate the child into tribal life. After the child is dressed in his or her best clothes, the bayoc loosens the child&rsquo;s hair and attaches pieces of gold to its tips. The bayoc starts to dance and in a trance kills the sacrificial pig, collects its blood in a container, and proceeds to pour it on the child. The baptism over, the shaman then cuts the tips of the child&rsquo;s hair and flings these to the bystanders who scramble for the precious strands. Songs are chanted by those nearest the child, while the rest of the bystanders respond to them also in chant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marriage, too, is sanctified by rituals. Among the Umayamnon, a wedding is formalized when the representatives of the groom and the bride sit on a mat to trade kernels of corn, which represent horses, gongs, rice, money, and red cloth. Once the dowry is set, betel nut is exchanged and chewed by the two parties to seal the pact. That over, the shaman kills the sacrificial animal nearby, after which the bride and groom stand up from the mat where they have been seated, and each steps on the pig to denote that they, as the supplicants represented by the animal, offer themselves to the anito. The pig is cleaned and cooked for the feast that follows.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"mimeticdance\" name=\"mimeticdance\"></a>The Mimetic Dances</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">Mimetic dances</a> may imitate the movements of animals on air, land, and water; depict the movements associated with tribal activities, whether political such as fighting in wars and head-hunting, economic such as rice planting, fishing, and hunting, or personal and social such as child rearing, courtship, or death; or dramatize episodes taken from or inspired by the epic of the tribe. Although most of these dances are now performed as social dances during the tribe&rsquo;s festivities, there is no doubt that most of them function beyond mere entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps because of their number, variety, and abundance all over the archipelago, birds have inspired the most number of dances among the cultural communities. In the <strong>kadal blila</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>, young girls in magnificent embroidered costumes and bead jewelry sling a&nbsp;<em>malong&nbsp;</em>(tubular skirt) around their necks, letting these hang in front like huge, round scarves. Their hands are then inserted into the two lower ends of the malong to form a triangle. As they execute the familiar hop-and-step movements of dance to the rhythm of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/810\">gongs</a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drums</a>, their hands make undulating movements with their malong to simulate a bird in flight. Other outstanding bird dances are those of the Tausug depicting the kingfisher, seagull, and sandpiper. The <strong>linggisan</strong> or sandpiper dance is performed by a single female, to the accompaniment of a&nbsp;<em>kulintang&nbsp;</em>(bossed gongs) ensemble. Wearing the traditional blouse and loose pants, the dancer executes&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\">pangalay</a>&nbsp;</em>movements, such as the mincing steps and fluid arm and finger movements, to suggest the grace of the seagull as it glides over Sulu&rsquo;s vast expanse of sea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, the bird dances may tell a story, as in the <strong>paypayto</strong> of the Ifugao where, to the music of the&nbsp;<em>gangsa&nbsp;</em>(flat gongs), male dancers in bent position hold or strike sticks on the ground and repeatedly jump over the sticks to represent high flying birds that have been disturbed by hunters from their perch and have fluttered away to safety. Other bird dances are the <strong>talik paterekterek</strong> (woodpecker dance) of the Aeta of Pampanga which is accompanied by the gitada; the <strong>bumbuak</strong> of the Gaddang which is accompanied by gongs; the <strong>burbudsil</strong> (woodpecker) of the Talaandig which is done to the rhythm of the&nbsp;<em>inagung</em>; the <strong>bubudsil</strong> (hornbill), <strong>binanog</strong> (hawk), and <strong>kakayamatan</strong> dances of the Manobo which may be accompanied by gongs or the&nbsp;<em>saluray&nbsp;</em>(polychordal zither); and the <strong>tarektek</strong> (bird) of the Ibaloy done to the accompaniment of the gangsa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other creatures of the air which have been represented in dance are the butterfly, as seen in the <strong>balamban</strong> of Isabela, and the <strong>kabal kabal</strong> of the Tausug, which represents mating butterflies; the duck, as exemplified by the <strong>talik bibi</strong> of the Aeta; and the fly, as represented in the <strong>talik lango</strong>, also of the Aeta of Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the land animals, the one that has captured the fancy of many cultural communities is the monkey. The Ikalahan have one of the most imaginative and amusing interpretations of the monkey. To the music of the gangsa, male dancers, with legs bent and bodies in a crouching position, tiptoe around, their long arms flailing to the side and acting as ballast or extra feet. With heads straining forward, the &ldquo;monkeys&rdquo; scratch their scalp, pick and feast on the imaginary lice on their heads as well as those on the heads of other &ldquo;monkeys.&rdquo; Executed with perfect muscle control, the dance takes the literal movements of the monkey and refines these into a dance that is marked by subtlety, charm, and uncommon artistry. Other simian dances are the <strong>inamong</strong> of the Matigsalug; the <strong>talik bake</strong> of the Aeta of Zambales, where the male dancer uses a G-string that has a long &ldquo;tail&rdquo; as he swings from the tree branches and runs around teasing children and adults; the <strong>kadal iwas</strong> of the Tboli, which features &ldquo;monkeys&rdquo; romping around covered with dried banana leaves; and the <strong>langka baluang</strong> of the Tausug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very intriguing and exhausting dance is the <strong>binakbak</strong> of the Higaonon, where males, sitting in lotus positions, use their hands to hop and jump around in imitation of frogs. Amusing, on the other hand, are the <strong>kinugsik-kugsik</strong> of the Agusanon Manobo, which shows two &ldquo;male squirrels&rdquo; scampering up and down as they court a &ldquo;female squirrel&rdquo;; and the <strong>igal kussah</strong> of the Tausug which depicts a wild boar trying in vain to crack a coconut and finally kicking it in desperation. Entertaining, too, are the <strong>talik barak</strong> of the Pampanga Aeta, in which the dancer represents a&nbsp;<em>bayawak&nbsp;</em>(huge lizard) swimming with its arms and legs in the dust; and the <strong>pagkamun</strong> of the Tausug, where a male dancer portrays the movements of a sea mantis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the dances depicting tribal activities, the <strong>war dance</strong> is the most widespread among indigenous communities. These dances are performed during social gatherings, but they take on a special meaning when done in connection with the circumcision of boys 10 or 11 years old. William Dampier recounted the context of the war dance that he had seen in 1687 among the Maguindanao. After the circumcision rites in the morning, the boys were made to sit in a big circle at the plaza in front of the sultan&rsquo;s house. There they watched the warriors of the tribe perform the dance. With a fierce cry, a warrior in full battle gear jumped into the circle, strutted around holding his sword and spear, then stared at his imaginary enemy, challenging him to a fight. Stamping his feet and shaking his head, he made faces to scare his opponent. He threw away his spear, drew his kris, and savagely hacked at the air as he screamed like a madman. In the end, tired from the struggle, he pounced on the imaginary enemy in the middle of the circle and with two or three strokes of his kris beheaded the fallen antagonist. He then withdrew from the circle and another warrior took his place. This went on the whole day and ended after the sultan, sponsor of the celebration, had shown his skill in the dance (Dampier 1971, 55-56).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the war dance endures among many ethnic groups of Mindanao and Sulu in almost the same form. Among the Talaandig, the <strong>saot</strong> is performed by men dressed in traditional knee breeches and jackets wearing the&nbsp;<em>tangkulo&nbsp;</em>(headdress), which is an index of a man&rsquo;s bravery. Ordinary men who have not chopped off any heads wear the brown tangkulo, but those who have killed more than 10 enemies, a man of prestige, or a big snake proudly flaunt a red tangkulo. To the music of the&nbsp;<em>tangungo</em>, a set of eight varisized gongs arranged on a net of ropes on a tripod, one or two males do regular hop-and-step movements, putting on a fierce look as they shake their&nbsp;<em>kalasag&nbsp;</em>(shield) and brandish their&nbsp;<em>bangkaw&nbsp;</em>(spear) or&nbsp;<em>kampilan&nbsp;</em>(sword) in the air. Working themselves up with shouts and egged on by music, spectators, and fellow dancers, the warriors turn in place or in broad circles. They crouch as though aiming at the enemy, stand to their full height, aiming and thrusting their weapons at their rival, then duck behind their shields as though warding off imaginary spears or swords coming at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost identical is the war dance found among the Tagoloanon, Bukidnon, Umayamnon, Higaonon, Tigwahanon, and Matigsalug&mdash;all of whom call their war dance <strong>saot</strong>, except for the last two who call it <strong>kalasag</strong>. Similar too is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/92\"><strong>sagayan</strong></a> of the Maguindanao and the Maranao, where warriors in plumed helmets, tight pants, and short, tiered overskirts, rattle their long, thin shields draped with stones, bells, or cowrie shells, as they jump, crouch, turn, move up and down, twirling their kris or hacking the air with it, clashing in midair like fighting cocks. These movements are adapted to the occasion for which the dance is performed. Among the Yakan, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/108\"><strong>tumahik</strong></a> (war dance) is performed to the music of a kulintang ensemble in front of the bride&rsquo;s house by the male relatives of the groom, as the latter is sitting on a chair with his bride who has been brought down from the house for the wedding rituals. Wearing a&nbsp;<em>pis&nbsp;</em>(headdress) and using a&nbsp;<em>budjak&nbsp;</em>(lance) and a round&nbsp;<em>taming&nbsp;</em>(shield), individual males, including the groom himself, though briefly, display their fighting skills, in order to show the bride and her relatives that the groom&rsquo;s family is a family of brave warriors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More common than the war dances among the northern Luzon groups are the <strong>head-taking dances</strong>. In the late 19th century, Schadenberg described a head-taking dance among the Igorot. Believing that one head must be cut during the rice planting season and another during the harvest&mdash;for the more heads, the better&mdash;the Igorot warriors leave their village in search of men or women whom they can ambush. They spear the victim first and proceed to cut off the hands, feet, and head that are then brought home to the village. At the celebration, the gangsa are played as the hunters perform a <strong>weapon dance</strong> &ldquo;which represents attack and defense&rdquo; and the &ldquo;usual dances, which are composed of tramping around with the feet, together with movements of the upper body and the arm&rdquo; (Schadenberg 1975, 147). Up to the American era, head taking was still practiced by the Kalinga when a pact is breached. Tribal enemies are attacked and their heads taken to the center of the village. Women welcome the head takers, putting&nbsp;<em>lawi&nbsp;</em>(crowns of rooster tail feathers) on the&nbsp;<em>mingers&nbsp;</em>(successful hunters). To the music of the gangsa, the mingers perform the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/84\"><strong>pattong</strong></a> around the heads which may be propped up on a wooden mortar. The&nbsp;<em>bodan&nbsp;</em>(those who failed to take heads) are relegated to playing the gangsa, as a reminder that they must try harder next time to bring home some heads. Women also join in the dance later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dances depicting economic activities abound among the ethnic communities, illustrating how central these activities are to their survival. Rice planting is the most common subject of these dances. A suite of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a> <strong>maral</strong> (dances) depicts the stages in rice planting&mdash;namely, the <strong>mabah</strong>, the <strong>almigo</strong>, the <strong>amla</strong>, and the <strong>kamto</strong> &mdash;performed in sequence to the music of the&nbsp;<em>tangungo</em>,&nbsp;<em>agong&nbsp;</em>(slit drums), and drums. In the mabah, a farmer comes in, searching for the right place to make a kaingin. He prays for an omen, waits for the call of the sacred bird, and drives two sticks into the ground pointing to the direction from where the call of the bird is heard. If the sticks are slanting close to the ground, he pulls them up and goes to another area, again to wait for the birdcalls. He continues to move from one place to another until his sticks are more or less upright, signifying that the bird is hovering over the chosen place. After ascertaining the kaingin area, the farmer takes out his betel nut and offers this to the spirit so that he and the spirit may chew the betel together. That done, the farmer proceeds to do the almigo (clearing), calling on the other menfolk to help him cut the wild underbrush and the women to bring them food as they work on the kaingin. After cutting the wild plants, the farmer initiates the burning of the cut branches. The amla (planting) follows. At a faster pace, the men come in, making holes in the ground with their&nbsp;<em>todak&nbsp;</em>(long poles), which have clappers on the upper end. Closely following the men are the women who drop rice seeds into the holes made by the todak and use their feet to cover the seeds with soil right after. Behind the women, the children flit in and out, replenishing the women&rsquo;s baskets with rice seeds. In a few seconds, the women come in again, this time to do the kamto (harvest). Using little sharp sickles, they cut imaginary heads of grain and deposit these in the baskets on their backs. Later they pretend to thresh the rice by stepping on the imaginary grain which are laid out on a mat, and winnow it in flat round baskets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tubers are eaten by many communities, and therefore figure in some native dances, among them the <strong>gabi</strong> of the Camarines Aeta, where a woman goes to a nearby stream and proceeds to &ldquo;dig&rdquo; and gather some of the gabi, represented by round stones strewn on the ground. One of the most delightful dances, however, is the <strong>pangamote</strong> or <strong>camote-gathering dance</strong> of the Higaonon, which tells a story and teaches a lesson. To the music of native drums, a woman in traditional costume comes in, holding a basket in her left hand and a stick in the other. She bends and ducks as though hiding from someone. Assured that there is no one around, she proceeds to &ldquo;dig&rdquo; the imaginary camote with her stick, quickly throwing these into her basket. Unfortunately, the lady owner of the camote catches her and tries to grab the basket from the thief. The thief begs the owner for mercy, rubs her stomach to say that she is hungry, and wipes imaginary tears from her eyes. Exasperated, the owner drives the thief away from her patch of sweet potatoes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To supplement their basic diet, cultural communities go out to hunt birds, honey, wild animals, and frogs. The Blaan <strong>admulak</strong> (bird hunting dance) has four males carrying bows and arrows. They crouch so as not to be seen by the bird but look up every so often when they hear bird sounds, which are made by a companion outside the performance area. Spotting an imaginary bird, one hunter takes aim and shoots it with an arrow. The bird falls. Immediately, the hunters build a fire. The bird is dressed and cooked but once cooked, only the hunter who shot it down consumes the bird. The greedy man gets sick, throws up, and lies down. The shaman is called in, and she gives him the flower of the sacred&nbsp;<em>bunga&nbsp;</em>(areca palm) tree to eat, as four women point their hands in his direction, to augment the power of the shaman. After praying to the gods for his recovery, the shaman and the women pick the man up from the ground, hold him up, and move his arms as though to bring him back to life. After a few minutes, the patient comes to and begins to take stronger steps. Extending his arms, turning around in place, and then dancing a full circle, the sick hunter finally revives and dances like a bird, perhaps even becoming the bird he has shot down and eaten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bee hunting dances</strong> are typified by the <strong>pinapanilan</strong> of the Aeta of Pampanga. Here, a male Aeta dances in a circle of children and some adults, to the accompaniment of the gitada. He pretends to be walking in the forest. He stops when he sees a beehive on a tree&mdash;just a piece of cloth attached to the top of a bamboo pole. Overjoyed, he tries to climb the tree but gets stung by the bees. The hunter slaps the bees dead, or drive them away. The hunter then creates a fire to smoke the bees away. With the bees gone, he climbs the tree and picks the hive. He goes home happy with his loot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A social dance among the Matigsalug is the <strong>panilo</strong> or <strong>frog hunting dance</strong>. Here, males and females in traditional garb carry small baskets and spears, and sometimes torches. Holding torches in one hand, they try to spot the frogs in the dark. The moment a hunter sees a frog, usually represented by a leaf, he spears it and promptly puts the catch into his basket. As the dance progresses, a hunter spots a snake&mdash;usually a beaded belt that has been laid on the grass before the start of the dance. Bravely, the hunter hacks at the snake with his bolo. The snake attacks him in turn, but he is able to kick it away. With a savage stroke, the hunter kills the snake. He then picks it up and carries it home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As most cultural communities live beside bodies of water, fishing has been a major source of food. Outstanding <strong>fishing dances</strong> are the <strong>amti</strong> of the Blaan and the <strong>tauti</strong> of the Sama of Tawi-Tawi. In the amti, a single male dancer comes in, laden with fish-hunting baskets. He first lays out his&nbsp;<em>bubo&nbsp;</em>(trap) on a shallow stream or the ground if there is no stream. He digs into the ground and anchors the traps with stones, so they are not washed away by the water. Next he takes&nbsp;<em>tubla&nbsp;</em>(poisonous roots), beats it with a stone, and then squeezes it over the water so that its sap may stun the fish. As he waits, he builds a fire by rubbing two sticks. He then goes back to inspect his traps and puts whatever fish he finds into his waist basket. Satisfied with his catch, he dismantles the traps and heads for home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As important as the activities of the community are the stages and the rites of passage in the life cycle. A dance that dramatizes a scene of infancy is the <strong>sinuhon no bata</strong> (crying baby) of the Matigsalug. Here, a full-grown man in traditional costume lies in a fetal position on a mat, creating the sounds of a crying baby with his mouth and bare hands. The woman, presumably the baby&rsquo;s mother, dances to the drums and&nbsp;<em>tangungo&nbsp;</em>as she tries to calm the baby with a lullaby. The baby continues to cry. Since the baby is obviously sick, the mother asks her husband to call in a babaylan, and the latter dances and says the&nbsp;<em>panubad&nbsp;</em>(prayer) to ask the spirits to cure the child. But even after much supplication and dancing, the child dies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most popular and numerous among all ethnic groups are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/49\"><strong>courtship dances</strong></a>. The prototype of the courtship dance may be seen among ethnic communities like the Blaan, whose&nbsp;<em>ye dayon&nbsp;</em>(courtship song) features a young man with a bamboo zither dancing around a maiden who also plays a bamboo zither; or the Bago and Itneg in the Cordillera, who have a song-and-dance courtship number, performed not by one girl and one boy but by a line of young girls and another of young men, chanting verses to each other. Among the Talaandig, the female contest for the man becomes slightly more spirited. The <strong>pig-agawan</strong> is performed to the basal music of the agong by three women and a man. Beautiful in their traditional costumes, the three women who may be sisters, cousins, or neighbors brandish&nbsp;<em>tubao&nbsp;</em>(kerchiefs) with their two hands&mdash;to the left and the right, up and down&mdash;as they move to a regular hop-and-step rhythm. They circle the male, trying to attract him. They push and shove each other, each one pulling the man to herself. The contest eventually becomes a fight. In the end, the females lay their tubao on the ground, and the male finally puts his bolo on top of the tubao of the woman of his choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A dance that shows not only a courtship but the history of it as well is the <strong>pandamgo</strong> (dream) of the Matigsalug. This mimetic dance tells the story of a barren woman who dreams that she begets and raises a child. Barren women are ostracized in Matigsalug society. Usually performed inside a house, this dance is accompanied by the&nbsp;<em>kudlong&nbsp;</em>(native lute), bamboo flutes, a&nbsp;<em>kubing&nbsp;</em>(mouth harp), and the clapping of the hands. A woman comes in holding a malong which is folded to look as if a baby is wrapped in it. Obviously delighted at the child she had long waited for, she rocks the infant in her arms. The woman exits behind a &ldquo;wall&rdquo; of&nbsp;<em>malong&nbsp;</em>and enters again, this time with a little girl in tow. They move together in circles and exit. When the woman enters once more, she is followed by an adolescent who is the focus of all her attention. As they dance, the mother puts a bead necklace around the girl&rsquo;s neck, and they exit. Finally, the mother comes in, this time with a fully grown pretty lass, on whose shoulders she bestows a malong. As the young woman dances with this symbol of womanhood, the first suitor comes in, and then the second. Both men dance around her, even as the mother hovers around, guarding her precious daughter. The second suitor puts a bead necklace around the girl&rsquo;s neck, but she throws it away. The mother picks up the necklace and puts it around her daughter&rsquo;s neck once more, to signify that she approves of the second suitor. But the girl removes the necklace for a second time. Then, the first suitor approaches and puts his necklace on the girl&rsquo;s neck. The girl does not take it off, but the mother does, to show her objection to the first suitor. Again, the second suitor presents her with a necklace, which the girl throws away once more. The mother insists, but the daughter is adamant. The first suitor presents his necklace again, and the girl does not take it off. With another exchange of necklaces, the contest intensifies until the two suitors finally unsheathe their bolos. As the men clash like two roosters, the mother is thrown into confusion, while her daughter tries to intervene to stop the battle. The two men fight to the death. In the end, the young woman weeps over her fate, and the mother is sorry she meddled in the courtship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abduction, rather than courtship, is the theme of some mimetic dance dramas. The <strong>binabayani</strong> of the Aeta of Pampanga has a male in a G-string prancing around to the drone of the gitada. He spots a woman digging for potatoes in the field. Like a hawk, he dances with his hands outstretched around her and finally swoops down on her and forces her to come with him. The couple moves toward another section of the field but continues dancing. Meanwhile, the male relatives of the girl discover her abduction and decide to hunt down the abductor with bow and arrow. The relatives travel in search of the girl and finally find the couple. There is a battle between the girl&rsquo;s relatives and the abductor which ends with the latter giving himself up. To make up for his offense, the abductor presents the girl&rsquo;s relatives with bolo, bows, and arrows, and other items in exchange for the girl he kidnapped. With that, peace is restored and the dance ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Blaan have a suite of dances that portray the abduction of a woman, the duel between the abductor and the husband, and the burial of the abductor. The first dance called <strong>amlad</strong> depicts a woman walking through the forest. Suddenly, the abductor comes out and circles around her. Frightened, the woman tries to elude her captor, but he grabs her by the hand and takes her with him. Soon after, the woman&rsquo;s husband arrives and challenges the abductor to a bolo duel called <strong>asdak</strong>. The two fight in dance until the abductor is killed. Two men come in and take the body in procession for the <strong>narong</strong> (burial). However, four women, representing the men&rsquo;s relatives, come in and promptly fight over the body, pulling the cadaver&rsquo;s hands and legs in all directions, to show their love for the dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, there are a few dances that reenact scenes or episodes from an epic. The Maranao have the famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/95\"><strong>singkil</strong></a>, which dramatizes the episode in the epic&nbsp;<em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></strong> </em>, where Prince Bantugan goes up the mountain to hunt for evil spirits and the garuda in order to save the princess Gandingan. The spirits try to kill Bantugan by hurling trees in his path, but he is able to sidestep the trees. Meanwhile, the earth quakes and opens up, but Gandingan is able to avoid the openings in the ground, keeping her grace and dignity as she jumps from one side to the other. In the end, Bantugan gets to the princess and takes her away from the mountain to be his wife. In the dance, Bantugan deftly goes through a gamut of clashing shields held by two lines of warriors to represent his struggle with the trees, while Gandingan gracefully steps in and out of eight pairs of clashing bamboos which together form a huge square, to represent her avoidance of earthquakes and spirits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"mimeticcustoms\" name=\"mimeticcustoms\"></a>The Mimetic Customs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from rituals and dances, customs may also be mimetic. As with the rituals and mimetic dances, these customs are mainly associated with courtship, wedding, and death. The courtship custom that has been practiced for centuries and has had the most varied development is the debate between male and female. This debate in verse survives today among many ethnic groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Maranao <strong>panonoroon</strong> has young girls and boys standing on opposite sides. In metered language that is replete with metaphors, a boy and a girl chant verses to each other. A boy may speak of his desire &ldquo;to catch a bird &rdquo; (i.e., to court a girl), which the girl may sidestep by saying &ldquo;you need a golden cage&rdquo; (i.e., you will need much more than desire to do that). Different boys and girls take turns at launching offensives and counteroffensives at each other in this group courtship. In the end, the two judges who have been listening to the exchanges decide who has won the contest of wit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, in Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, the Ibanag have preserved their version of the debate in verse with music called the <strong>kinantaran</strong>. Since young men and women now shy away from the performance, little boys in barong tagalog and little girls in&nbsp;<em>maria clara&nbsp;</em>(upper-class gown) perform the courtship at social gatherings. As the couple sing verses to each other, they also dance in a manner similar to the Tagalog <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/64\"><strong>comintang</strong></a> described by Mallat (1973) in 1846. In a typical exchange, the Ibanag boy named Pepe may say, &ldquo;I love you so much. Please take pity on me,&rdquo; to which the girl Neneng may reply, &ldquo;Go away. I do not care to hear your pleas. Wait for another day.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cebu and Bohol, the debate in verse survives in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/442\"><strong>balitaw</strong></a>, an antiphonal song in lively 3/4 time, which uses the octosyllabic quatrain with assonantal rhyme in varying patterns such as A-A-A-A or A-B-A-B. As they dance to the accompaniment of harp and guitar, the singer-dancers may speak of a variety of topics relating to true love, married life and its travails, the proper rearing of children, the difficulties of being a&nbsp;<em>tuba&nbsp;</em>(coconut wine) gatherer or a worker, and many other timely topics. The verses used may be prosaic or poetic, and may draw from the wealth of Cebuano folklore&mdash;proverbs, riddles, legends, myths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Tagalog, the debate in verse is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><strong>duplo</strong></a>, a game of wit using dodecasyllabic quatrains performed during the wake for the dead. In this contest, a <strong>hari</strong> (king) and his <strong>prinsesa</strong> (princess) sit at the head of a long table or at center stage if the duplo is held as a separate performance. The male participants called <strong>bilyako</strong> sit on the king&rsquo;s right while the female participants called bilyaka sit on his left. The king begins the game by announcing that his kingdom is open to all worthy visitors. One by one, male participants from outside the circle or from below the stage call on the king, introducing themselves and asking to be admitted into the kingdom. After an exchange of verses, the king admits each one of them and seats them. The first bilyako then stands to express his admiration for one of the bilyaka or even for the princess. The bilyaka may stand up to reject or accept the attention given to her, or the second bilyako may stand up to interpose an objection to the first bilyako&rsquo;s expression of admiration and offer his own instead. The game may take any direction depending on the participants, with the poets delighting the audience with the novelty of their images, the eloquence of their verse, the allusions to the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\">pasyon</a>&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>awit</em>, to proverbs and riddles, and especially to contemporary issues, events, and personalities. In the 1920s, the duplo was shaped into a formal debate called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\"><strong>balagtasan</strong></a>, with a <strong>lakandiwa</strong> standing as moderator to two male/female poets, each defending one side of a given topic (e.g., Who is better&mdash;the woman of yesterday or the woman of today?). Due to its popularity, the balagtasan gave birth to a similar debate in Spanish, in Pampango called <strong>crissotan</strong>, and in Ilocano called <strong>bukanegan</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Courtship is followed by the arrangements for the wedding, the first of which is the settlement of the dowry. This custom is often mimetic because the agreement is done on a symbolic level, with spokespersons using metaphors in the negotiations. In the <strong>samsung</strong> of the Blaan, the parents of the bride and groom squat on a mat. The mediator sits between them and oversees the turnover of the bride price consisting of gongs, weapons, betel nut boxes, horses, carabaos,&nbsp;<em>tnalak&nbsp;</em>cloth, and 200 pesos. As the gifts are given, the parents of the girl show disinterest so as not to appear too eager to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; their daughter. Later, the girl&rsquo;s parents give a&nbsp;<em>dagmay&nbsp;</em>cloth to the other side to make it look as if their daughter was not bought after all. Then the fathers of the bride and groom exchange bolos to seal the pact as the chanting continues. The groom, who is not far from where the negotiations are being held, is then dressed and fetched by his friends and made to sit on a tnalak laid out by his mother as he waits for his bride. The girl who has been hiding at a distance is fetched by her friends and relatives. She pretends to kick and push them away, seemingly not wanting to marry. She is then made to sit beside the groom, whom she does not even want to look at. The officiating elder ties their hair together, and takes a step between them. Then the datu gives the couple advice for a happy marriage. The groom stands up, puts his right foot on the girl&rsquo;s shoulder, and sits again. The girl follows suit, but instead of simply putting her foot on his shoulder, she actually kicks him angrily. After this, the couple is considered married, and they dance, imitating a rooster and a hen. Soon everyone is dancing to the music of the tangungo and the&nbsp;<em>saliyaw&nbsp;</em>(bells).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Yakan, the <strong>pagkawin</strong> (marriage) begins with the bride and groom being made up in traditional fashion. The bride is then brought down from the house and sits near the groom. The&nbsp;<em>imam&nbsp;</em>sprinkles water on the faces of the couple, sits on the floor opposite the groom, and presses his foot against the groom&rsquo;s foot and his thumb against the groom&rsquo;s thumb. The imam then covers their thumbs with a white piece of cloth. Meanwhile, as the&nbsp;<em>kamanyang&nbsp;</em>(incense) burns beside the couple, the imam and the elders give the couple advice regarding married life. To the shouts of the spectators, the groom twice offers a mouthful of rice to the bride which she refuses. On the third offer, she takes the rice, and the family eats after her. The groom then puts a piece of white cloth on the bride&rsquo;s shoulder. She throws it away. This happens twice. On the third time, the bride keeps it on her shoulder, signifying her acceptance of the groom. Everybody applauds and shouts approval. The new couple now stands and, to the music of the kulintang ensemble, dances the&nbsp;<em>pangalay&nbsp;</em>to make public their new status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mimetic customs relating to death are fewer than those associated with courtship and weddings. Among the Ifugao, the <strong>natoy</strong> is the important custom observed for the dead. In 1982, the natoy for a slain Ifugao youth required that the body be seated on the chair in the clothes he was murdered in. As the body decomposed on the chair, the relatives and friends of the dead jeered at him, telling him to stand up and avenge himself. On the day of the burial, which happened a few days after, a sacrificial pig was killed at high noon, so that the dead may see his enemy clearly. The legs of the pig were cut so that the enemy may fall into a ravine. Then all the warriors of the tribe, wearing bolos, red bands on their breasts, and red dongla leaves on their heads that signify anger at the murder, participated in the&nbsp;<em>monghimong&nbsp;</em>(literally, inching one&rsquo;s way), striking the death sticks called&nbsp;<em>bangibang</em>. With the&nbsp;<em>mumbaki&nbsp;</em>(priest) at the head, the warriors moved, following men brandishing two spears each, prolonging the wake by inching themselves toward the place of burial. Upon reaching the burial hill, the warriors disbanded and left the family to bury their dead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another mimetic custom for burial is the <strong>lubong</strong> of the Abiyan or Camarines Aeta. In the past, real deer used to be offered to the dead, but with the disappearance of the forest and wild life, the dead now have to be contented with the&nbsp;<em>baraning usa</em>, a deer figure that has a chopped banana trunk for its body, wooden sticks for its legs, and twigs for its horns. The deer is set amid wild vegetation and is first &ldquo;hunted down&rdquo; by the Abiyan males with bow and arrow. Meanwhile, the relatives of the dead prepare offerings of food&mdash;banana trunk pieces strung together on sticks to represent barbecued meat. The dead is wrapped in a mat of split bamboo with the thumbs of his hands and his two feet tied together, and then laid in a two-feet-deep grave. Money and betel nut are placed in his hands. The grave is then covered with fine soil and banana leaves and a fence is built around it to keep wild animals and bees away. Rice cooked in banana leaves may be hung on the fence. The mother and the relatives of the deceased crawl around the bamboo fence to bid the dead farewell. Then the offerings of rice cooked in leaves, betel-nut chew, as well as the barbecued leaves, bird snares, and deer are laid beside the grave. A torch of dried coconut leaves is lit and a man goes around the grave with it to drive away the bees which should not nest in the area. With the offerings properly laid out, the relatives and friends then break off tree branches in order to drive away the flies as they flee the area as it is believed that the person on whom a fly alights will die next.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dramas of the indigenous peoples of the Philippines are significant because they are organically linked with the people&rsquo;s lives. For one, they feature the material culture of the tribe, as they mirror the activities of the tribe as well as the flora and fauna that surround and impinge on the life of the tribe. All the mimetic dances, rituals, and customs show men and women wearing the costumes and jewelry and using the tools and weapons of the tribe, identifying them with the tribe. Aside from showcasing these indigenous objects, the dances interpret the major tribal activities, highlighting and reaffirming their importance to the life of the community. In the dances depicting war, head-hunting, rice planting, honey gathering, and animal hunting, the members of the tribe recognize and accept their everyday work as concerns legitimized by the entire community. Moreover, nature is depicted in their dances. Such dances showing the movements of the hawk, the sandpiper, the duck, the fly, the butterfly, and the monkey serve to sharpen the tribal people&rsquo;s sensitivity to the living things that surround them and come to define their relationship with nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the subject matter of the performance is easily recognizable and falls within everyone&rsquo;s experience, there is no alienation of any kind between performer and spectator such that spectators may actually stand up and join the performers at any point in the dancing. Thus, all Kalinga males can participate in a war dance because every male is trained to do battle with tribal enemies, while every Blaan female can do planting and harvesting movements because this is work they do year in and year out. Strictly speaking, therefore, there are no actors or spectators in indigenous dramas&mdash;only members of the tribe who can be both on their own volition. Moreover, indigenous dramas need no <strong>entablado</strong> or stage because the best, the only, and the most logical performance venue is the common circle/plaza of the tribal village where all major councils and festivals are held. A stage or any elevated platform is unthinkable in this tradition because such a structure presumes a difference in experience and skills between actor on stage and spectator below it&mdash;a distinction that has no meaning or significance in the tribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous dramas do not only mirror the culture of the tribe. More importantly, they fulfill functions important to the tribe, especially during the time when the integrity of tribal life and culture had not yet been eroded or breached by external realities. In the past, war dances served a crucial political function, either to prepare warriors for actual combat; to instruct the youth in the techniques of using the sword, the spear, and the shield in actual combat; or to condition all the members of the tribe to the reality of tribal warfare. Similarly, the dances that portrayed economic activities such as rice planting, bird hunting, and fishing did not only delight the young but also taught them the techniques needed in these activities. Like the dances, many rituals were performed to answer the basic needs of the tribe for a good rice harvest, victory in war, and the health and prosperity of the members of the tribe at the crucial stages of birth, childhood, courtship, wedding, sickness, and death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indigenous dramas also serve to maintain harmony within the tribe through various ways. First, through the rituals, dances, and customs, the values of the tribe are validated and taught. Thus, for example, the baptism rites of the Zambal, as recorded in 1680, teach the child and the community that prosperity is important to an individual but that it should be shared by everyone in the tribe. Second, the customs and laws that the tribe has set for everyone to follow are strengthened by the dances. The binabayani of the Aeta of Zambales, for example, upholds the custom law which provides that a man who abducts a woman pay for the abduction with material goods such as bolos and clothes. Third, plays provide for acceptable outlets for individual emotions which, if left unexpressed, may subvert social order. The customs that allow the expression of ill feelings such as the <strong>bical</strong>, those that give vent to feelings of love and sexual desire such as the panonoroon and balitaw, and the rituals associated with death such as the Blaan narong and the Ifugao natoy&mdash;all these provide a formal way of coping with personal emotions and is an effective means of externalizing strong, violent emotions that need expression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourth, many of the rituals, dances, and customs associated with the life cycle serve to define for all members of the tribe the new roles and relationships that should be recognized by all. The rituals for birth introduce a new member of the tribe, while the baptism or circumcision of the young define their coming-of-age. Similarly, the celebrations for weddings underscore a new relationship between one male and one female and their respective families, which must be respected by all. Fifth, indigenous dramas are performed at and constitute the centerpiece of the major events when everyone comes together to chant, dance, eat, and talk with other members of the tribe. Such an interaction among families usually isolated in their houses or neighborhood for the greater part of the year is nothing less than a periodic confluence of all their consciousness, which effectively reaffirms the individual&rsquo;s commitment to the tribe and the tribe&rsquo;s commitment to its members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, as the country strives to define itself as a nation with an identity of its own, serious artists will have to go back to their roots in ethnic and folk culture in order to discover the worldview, the aesthetics, and the forms that are indigenous to the Filipino. These will become the sources and inspiration for their own contemporary works. Fortunately, many artists and cultural workers have already staged landmark works that are breakthroughs in this endeavor. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3214\">Frank Rivera</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/613\"><strong><em>Mga&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Kuwentong&nbsp;</em><em>Maranao</em></strong></a> (Maranao Tales), 1974, revolves around a&nbsp;<em>pusong&nbsp;</em>or trickster character who comments on the corrupt leadership of the martial law era. <strong><em>Maharadja Lawana</em></strong>, 1976, dramatizes in <strong>kambayoka style</strong> the Maranao version of the <strong><em>Ramayana</em></strong>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/136\"><strong>Diablos</strong></a></em></strong> (Demons), 1989, uses a Bagobo myth to dramatize in lumad-inspired choreography, the need to preserve life in the face of those who use weapons and nuclear power for self-serving ends. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\">Agnes Locsin</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong> (Enchantress), 1991, narrates, through &ldquo;neo-ethnic&rdquo; movements done to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala</a>&rsquo;s ethnic fusion music, the destruction of the native beliefs, way of life, and environment with the coming of an aggressive and patriarchal conqueror from the West, while her <strong><em>Hinilawod</em></strong> (Tales from the Mouth of the Halawod River), 1992, dramatizes the story of the three royal brothers Humadapnon, Labaw Donggon, and Dumalapdap and their search for their respective wives&shy;&mdash;also with neo-ethnic choreography. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3352\">Rody Vera</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Paglalakbay ni&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Radiya&nbsp;</em><em>Mangandiri</em></strong> (Rajah Mangandiri&rsquo;s Journey), 1993, is a retelling of the Maranao Ramayana and its message about leadership in society, using Maranao musical instruments, songs, dances, and costumes. Vera&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/561\"><strong><em>Ibalong</em></strong></a>, 2013, is a musical based on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> epic that uses mythological characters to comment on man&rsquo;s abuse of the natural resources. Although these works are clearly ethnic in inspiration, form, or technique, they are also undeniably national in consciousness, concern, and appeal. In a country that is still so steeped in Western culture, these works prove that a Filipino national culture that is contemporary yet rooted in tradition is now in the process of becoming. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

After the circumcision rites in the morning, the boys were made to sit in a big circle at the plaza in front of the sultan&#x2019;s house. There they watched the warriors of the tribe perform the dance. With a fierce cry, a warrior in full battle gear jumped into the circle, strutted around holding his sword and spear, then stared at his imaginary enemy, challenging him to a fight. Stamping his feet and shaking his head, he made faces to scare his opponent. He threw away his spear, drew his kris, and savagely hacked at the air as he screamed like a madman. In the end, tired from the struggle, he pounced on the imaginary enemy in the middle of the circle and with two or three strokes of his kris beheaded the fallen antagonist. He then withdrew from the circle and another warrior took his place. This went on the whole day and ended after the sultan, sponsor of the celebration, had shown his skill in the dance (Dampier 1971, 55-56)."

If the sticks are slanting close to the ground, he pulls them up and goes to another area, again to wait for the birdcalls. He continues to move from one place to another until his sticks are more or less upright, signifying that the bird is hovering over the chosen place. After ascertaining the kaingin area, the farmer takes out his betel nut and offers this to the spirit so that he and the spirit may chew the betel together. That done, the farmer proceeds to do the almigo (clearing), calling on the other menfolk to help him cut the wild underbrush and the women to bring them food as they work on the kaingin. After cutting the wild plants, the farmer initiates the burning of the cut branches. The amla (planting) follows. At a faster pace, the men come in, making holes in the ground with their&#xA0;<em>todak&#xA0;</em>(long poles), which have clappers on the upper end. Closely following the men are the women who drop rice seeds into the holes made by the todak and use their feet to cover the seeds with soil right after.

Usually performed inside a house, this dance is accompanied by the&#xA0;<em>kudlong&#xA0;</em>(native lute), bamboo flutes, a&#xA0;<em>kubing&#xA0;</em>(mouth harp), and the clapping of the hands. A woman comes in holding a malong which is folded to look as if a baby is wrapped in it. Obviously delighted at the child she had long waited for, she rocks the infant in her arms. The woman exits behind a &#x201C;wall&#x201D; of&#xA0;<em>malong&#xA0;</em>and enters again, this time with a little girl in tow. They move together in circles and exit. When the woman enters once more, she is followed by an adolescent who is the focus of all her attention. As they dance, the mother puts a bead necklace around the girl&#x2019;s neck, and they exit. Finally, the mother comes in, this time with a fully grown pretty lass, on whose shoulders she bestows a malong. As the young woman dances with this symbol of womanhood, the first suitor comes in, and then the second. Both men dance around her, even as the mother hovers around, guarding her precious daughter. The second suitor puts a bead necklace around the girl&#x2019;s neck, but she throws it away. The mother picks up the necklace and puts it around her daughter&#x2019;s neck once more, to signify that she approves of the second suitor. But the girl removes the necklace for a second time. Then, the first suitor approaches and puts his necklace on the girl&#x2019;s neck. The girl does not take it off, but the mother does, to show her objection to the first suitor. Again, the second suitor presents her with a necklace, which the girl throws away once more. The mother insists, but the daughter is adamant. The first suitor presents his necklace again, and the girl does not take it off. With another exchange of necklaces, the contest intensifies until the two suitors finally unsheathe their bolos. As the men clash like two roosters, the mother is thrown into confusion, while her daughter tries to intervene to stop the battle. The two men fight to the death. In the end, the young woman weeps over her fate, and the mother is sorry she meddled in the courtship."

Like a hawk, he dances with his hands outstretched around her and finally swoops down on her and forces her to come with him. The couple moves toward another section of the field but continues dancing. Meanwhile, the male relatives of the girl discover her abduction and decide to hunt down the abductor with bow and arrow. The relatives travel in search of the girl and finally find the couple. There is a battle between the girl&#x2019;s relatives and the abductor which ends with the latter giving himself up. To make up for his offense, the abductor presents the girl&#x2019;s relatives with bolo, bows, and arrows, and other items in exchange for the girl he kidnapped.

Frightened, the woman tries to elude her captor, but he grabs her by the hand and takes her with him.

The spirits try to kill Bantugan by hurling trees in his path, but he is able to sidestep the trees. Meanwhile, the earth quakes and opens up, but Gandingan is able to avoid the openings in the ground, keeping her grace and dignity as she jumps from one side to the other. In the end, Bantugan gets to the princess and takes her away from the mountain to be his wife. In the dance, Bantugan deftly goes through a gamut of clashing shields held by two lines of warriors to represent his struggle with the trees, while Gandingan gracefully steps in and out of eight pairs of clashing bamboos which together form a huge square, to represent her avoidance of earthquakes and spirits."

The male participants called <strong>bilyako</strong> sit on the king&#x2019;s right while the female participants called bilyaka sit on his left. The king begins the game by announcing that his kingdom is open to all worthy visitors. One by one, male participants from outside the circle or from below the stage call on the king, introducing themselves and asking to be admitted into the kingdom. After an exchange of verses, the king admits each one of them and seats them. The first bilyako then stands to express his admiration for one of the bilyaka or even for the princess. The bilyaka may stand up to reject or accept the attention given to her, or the second bilyako may stand up to interpose an objection to the first bilyako&#x2019;s expression of admiration and offer his own instead. The game may take any direction depending on the participants, with the poets delighting the audience with the novelty of their images, the eloquence of their verse, the allusions to the&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/9/73/1558\">pasyon</a>&#xA0;</em>and the&#xA0;<em>awit</em>, to proverbs and riddles, and especially to contemporary issues, events, and personalities.

This custom is often mimetic because the agreement is done on a symbolic level, with spokespersons using metaphors in the negotiations. In the <strong>samsung</strong> of the Blaan, the parents of the bride and groom squat on a mat. The mediator sits between them and oversees the turnover of the bride price consisting of gongs, weapons, betel nut boxes, horses, carabaos,&#xA0;<em>tnalak&#xA0;</em>cloth, and 200 pesos. As the gifts are given, the parents of the girl show disinterest so as not to appear too eager to &#x201C;sell&#x201D; their daughter. Later, the girl&#x2019;s parents give a&#xA0;<em>dagmay&#xA0;</em>cloth to the other side to make it look as if their daughter was not bought after all. Then the fathers of the bride and groom exchange bolos to seal the pact as the chanting continues. The groom, who is not far from where the negotiations are being held, is then dressed and fetched by his friends and made to sit on a tnalak laid out by his mother as he waits for his bride. The girl who has been hiding at a distance is fetched by her friends and relatives. She pretends to kick and push them away, seemingly not wanting to marry. She is then made to sit beside the groom, whom she does not even want to look at. The officiating elder ties their hair together, and takes a step between them. Then the datu gives the couple advice for a happy marriage. The groom stands up, puts his right foot on the girl&#x2019;s shoulder, and sits again. The girl follows suit, but instead of simply putting her foot on his shoulder, she actually kicks him angrily. After this, the couple is considered married, and they dance, imitating a rooster and a hen. Soon everyone is dancing to the music of the tangungo and the&#xA0;<em>saliyaw&#xA0;</em>(bells)."

As the body decomposed on the chair, the relatives and friends of the dead jeered at him, telling him to stand up and avenge himself. On the day of the burial, which happened a few days after, a sacrificial pig was killed at high noon, so that the dead may see his enemy clearly. The legs of the pig were cut so that the enemy may fall into a ravine. Then all the warriors of the tribe, wearing bolos, red bands on their breasts, and red dongla leaves on their heads that signify anger at the murder, participated in the&#xA0;<em>monghimong&#xA0;</em>(literally, inching one&#x2019;s way), striking the death sticks called&#xA0;<em>bangibang</em>. With the&#xA0;<em>mumbaki&#xA0;</em>(priest) at the head, the warriors moved, following men brandishing two spears each, prolonging the wake by inching themselves toward the place of burial.

The deer is set amid wild vegetation and is first &#x201C;hunted down&#x201D; by the Abiyan males with bow and arrow. Meanwhile, the relatives of the dead prepare offerings of food&#x2014;banana trunk pieces strung together on sticks to represent barbecued meat. The dead is wrapped in a mat of split bamboo with the thumbs of his hands and his two feet tied together, and then laid in a two-feet-deep grave. Money and betel nut are placed in his hands. The grave is then covered with fine soil and banana leaves and a fence is built around it to keep wild animals and bees away. Rice cooked in banana leaves may be hung on the fence. The mother and the relatives of the deceased crawl around the bamboo fence to bid the dead farewell. Then the offerings of rice cooked in leaves, betel-nut chew, as well as the barbecued leaves, bird snares, and deer are laid beside the grave. A torch of dried coconut leaves is lit and a man goes around the grave with it to drive away the bees which should not nest in the area. With the offerings properly laid out, the relatives and friends then break off tree branches in order to drive away the flies as they flee the area as it is believed that the person on whom a fly alights will die next."

For one, they feature the material culture of the tribe, as they mirror the activities of the tribe as well as the flora and fauna that surround and impinge on the life of the tribe. All the mimetic dances, rituals, and customs show men and women wearing the costumes and jewelry and using the tools and weapons of the tribe, identifying them with the tribe. Aside from showcasing these indigenous objects, the dances interpret the major tribal activities, highlighting and reaffirming their importance to the life of the community. In the dances depicting war, head-hunting, rice planting, honey gathering, and animal hunting, the members of the tribe recognize and accept their everyday work as concerns legitimized by the entire community. Moreover, nature is depicted in their dances. Such dances showing the movements of the hawk, the sandpiper, the duck, the fly, the butterfly, and the monkey serve to sharpen the tribal people&#x2019;s sensitivity to the living things that surround them and come to define their relationship with nature."

				"value": "Because the subject matter of the performance is easily recognizable and falls within everyone&#x2019;s experience, there is no alienation of any kind between performer and spectator such that spectators may actually stand up and join the performers at any point in the dancing. Thus, all Kalinga males can participate in a war dance because every male is trained to do battle with tribal enemies, while every Blaan female can do planting and harvesting movements because this is work they do year in and year out. Strictly speaking, therefore, there are no actors or spectators in indigenous dramas&#x2014;only members of the tribe who can be both on their own volition. Moreover, indigenous dramas need no <strong>entablado</strong> or stage because the best, the only, and the most logical performance venue is the common circle/plaza of the tribal village where all major councils and festivals are held. A stage or any elevated platform is unthinkable in this tradition because such a structure presumes a difference in experience and skills between actor on stage and spectator below it&#x2014;a distinction that has no meaning or significance in the tribe."

				"value": "Indigenous dramas do not only mirror the culture of the tribe. More importantly, they fulfill functions important to the tribe, especially during the time when the integrity of tribal life and culture had not yet been eroded or breached by external realities. In the past, war dances served a crucial political function, either to prepare warriors for actual combat; to instruct the youth in the techniques of using the sword, the spear, and the shield in actual combat; or to condition all the members of the tribe to the reality of tribal warfare. Similarly, the dances that portrayed economic activities such as rice planting, bird hunting, and fishing did not only delight the young but also taught them the techniques needed in these activities. Like the dances, many rituals were performed to answer the basic needs of the tribe for a good rice harvest, victory in war, and the health and prosperity of the members of the tribe at the crucial stages of birth, childhood, courtship, wedding, sickness, and death."

			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Indigenous dramas also serve to maintain harmony within the tribe through various ways. First, through the rituals, dances, and customs, the values of the tribe are validated and taught. Thus, for example, the baptism rites of the Zambal, as recorded in 1680, teach the child and the community that prosperity is important to an individual but that it should be shared by everyone in the tribe. Second, the customs and laws that the tribe has set for everyone to follow are strengthened by the dances. The binabayani of the Aeta of Zambales, for example, upholds the custom law which provides that a man who abducts a woman pay for the abduction with material goods such as bolos and clothes. Third, plays provide for acceptable outlets for individual emotions which, if left unexpressed, may subvert social order. The customs that allow the expression of ill feelings such as the <strong>bical</strong>, those that give vent to feelings of love and sexual desire such as the panonoroon and balitaw, and the rituals associated with death such as the Blaan narong and the Ifugao natoy&#x2014;all these provide a formal way of coping with personal emotions and is an effective means of externalizing strong, violent emotions that need expression."

				"type": "paragraph",

The rituals for birth introduce a new member of the tribe, while the baptism or circumcision of the young define their coming-of-age. Similarly, the celebrations for weddings underscore a new relationship between one male and one female and their respective families, which must be respected by all. Fifth, indigenous dramas are performed at and constitute the centerpiece of the major events when everyone comes together to chant, dance, eat, and talk with other members of the tribe. Such an interaction among families usually isolated in their houses or neighborhood for the greater part of the year is nothing less than a periodic confluence of all their consciousness, which effectively reaffirms the individual&#x2019;s commitment to the tribe and the tribe&#x2019;s commitment to its members."

Vera&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/561\"><strong><em>Ibalong</em></strong></a>, 2013, is a musical based on the <a href=\"/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> epic that uses mythological characters to comment on man&#x2019;s abuse of the natural resources. Although these works are clearly ethnic in inspiration, form, or technique, they are also undeniably national in consciousness, concern, and appeal. In a country that is still so steeped in Western culture, these works prove that a Filipino national culture that is contemporary yet rooted in tradition is now in the process of becoming. <span class>&#xA0;</span>"

During this 333-year reign, the Spanish government introduced to the islands the Catholic religion and the Hispanic way of life mainly from Spain and Mexico, which was gradually appropriated by the indigenous culture to form the &ldquo;lowland folk culture.&rdquo; This is the culture now shared by the country&rsquo;s major ethnolinguistic groups like the<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\"> Ilocano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">lbanag</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2358\">Karay-A</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, Lineyte Samarnon, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2342\">Cuyunon</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the colonial period and even after it, theater was employed as a means of teaching and propagating the Catholic religion as well as for establishing and maintaining Spanish rule over the islands. Dramatic forms with Hispanic influence preaching Catholic and colonial messages were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, as well as different playlets associated with Christmas and Lent. After the opening of the archipelago to foreign trade starting in 1834 and the arrival of more and more European artists after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, a more secular culture entered the urbanized areas, introducing such forms as the Spanish <strong>zarzuela</strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a>. In the beginning, Filipino artists appeared with Spanish actors in Spanish works, but by the end of the 19th century, Filipino writers, composers, and producers began indigenizing them in both content and form, creating the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> and dramas in the native languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the American colonization of the islands at the turn of the century, the sarsuwela and the drama captured the imagination of Filipino audiences from the 1900s to the 1920s, first in Manila and the Tagalog provinces, and later in the key cities and towns that spoke Ilocano, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Bikol, Cebuano, Ilonggo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>. By the 1930s, however, these forms began to decline in popularity with the rise of the American-inspired <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> and the foreign and local talking pictures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the post-World War II period, some of these Hispanic forms continued to be performed in some provinces through the sponsorship of <strong>hermanos mayores</strong> (principal sponsors) during town fiestas. With the resurgence of cultural nationalism in the late 1960s and 1970s, Hispanic plays, especially the sarsuwela, were revived or revitalized to make them more responsive to the conditions and needs of a developing nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"komedya\" name=\"komedya\"></a>The Komedya</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Descended from the Spanish <strong>comedia</strong> (play) of the 16th century, the local komedya first appeared in Latin and Spanish in 1598 in Cebu. In 1609, the komedya on the martyrdom of Santa Barbara, the first in a native language, facilitated the conversion of the Boholanos to Christianity. Later, in 1637, a famous komedya depicted the defeat of Corralat (Kudarat) at the hands of Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera. In the 18th century, the komedya depicting conflicts in distant medieval European kingdoms began to be staged. By the 19th century, the komedya had become an institution in Manila theaters and soon after became popular fiesta fare&mdash;in Pampanga by the 1830s, in the Ilocos by the 1850s, in Bicol by the 1860s, and in Iloilo and Cebu toward the end of the 19th century. In spite of the attacks on the komedya and the rise of the sarsuwela in the 1900s and bodabil in the 1920s, the komedya still attracted rural audiences even after World War II. Today, the mass media, especially film, has effectively eliminated many traditional drama forms, but the komedya survives in a few towns all over the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The komedya is a play written in verse, usually in octosyllabic or dodecasyllabic quatrains, which uses the conventions of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>marcha</strong></a> or march for exits and entrances, <strong>batalla</strong> (choreographed fighting), and <strong>magia</strong> (magical effects). At present, the komedya may be divided into two principal types. The first, which may be called <strong>komedya de santo</strong>, centers on the lives of patron saints, like the <strong><em>Comedia de San Miguel</em></strong> (Play of San Miguel) of Iligan City; the miracles wrought by these saints, like the <strong><em>Haybing</em></strong> of Taal, Batangas; or on certain episodes in the life of a saint or of Christ, like the <strong><em>Comedia de Misterio</em></strong> (Play of Mystery) of Paete, Laguna. The second and more secular type of komedya, also known as <strong>kumidya</strong>, <strong>moro-moro</strong>, <strong>linambay</strong>, <strong>coloquio</strong>, <strong>araquio</strong>, <strong>tibag</strong>, and <strong>minoros</strong>, may highlight the epic battles between Christian kingdoms in medieval Europe (e.g., Francia, Espa&ntilde;a, Italia, Alemania, Albania) and the Moorish kingdoms of the Middle East (e.g., Turquia, Persia, Arabia), as seen in <strong><em>Doce Pares de Francia</em></strong> (Twelve Peers of France); or the lives and loves of noble Christian or Muslim characters, as seen, respectively, in <strong><em>Don Alejandre y</em></strong> <em><strong>Don Luis</strong> </em>(Don Alejandro and Don Luis) and&nbsp;<em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></strong> </em>(Orosman and Zafira).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The komedya de santo may derive its stories from the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido&nbsp;</em>(<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>) narrating the lives of saints, from the hagiographies popularized by books or sermons, or from the stories of miracles attributed to certain saints. The secular komedya, on the other hand, draws most of its stories, characters, and even lines from the awit and korido set in medieval kingdoms that were published as&nbsp;<em>libritos&nbsp;</em>(pamphlets) and sold together with prayer books outside Catholic churches on Sundays. In the decades after World War II, the komedya began to be influenced as well by the movies and popular magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A well-known komedya de santo is the <strong><em>Comedia de San Miguel</em></strong> of Iligan City which is performed in honor of Iligan&rsquo;s patron saint, San Miguel Arcangel, on his feast day on 29 Sep. In part 1, God asks Lusbel to guard the seven temples while he is away, entrusting him with the key but forbidding him from opening one temple. The arrogant Lusbel resents the prohibition and disobeys God&rsquo;s order. God then summons San Miguel to put Lusbel in line, but Lusbel is unrepentant. Holding God&rsquo;s banner and sword, San Miguel rallies his band of good angels and engages Lusbel and his group of rebels in a decisive battle. Lusbel and his cohorts are defeated and consigned to the fires of hell forever. In part 2, which is popularly known as &ldquo;Yawa-Yawa,&rdquo; literally &ldquo;Devil-Devil,&rdquo; individual demons wearing red costumes and masks and outdoing each other in fun and fantasy, introduce themselves and the evils they represent (including the seven capital sins), while Lusbel, who has been turned into a seven-headed monster, looks on. Part 3, which has not been performed for some time, dramatizes a morality tale contrasting the lives of a rich man who lives a life of indulgence and sin and ends up in hell, and a hermit who denies himself the pleasures of the world and ends up in heaven.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example of the secular komedya is <strong><em>Biag ni&nbsp;</em><em>Prinsipe Constantino</em></strong> (Life of Prince Constantine) by Lorenza Pre of Santa Catalina, Ilocos, Sur. Written ca. 1990, the komedya follows a traditional plot. A battle is fought between the Christians of Granada and the Moors of Amorabia. The Christians lose, the king dies, and in the confusion that follows, the king&rsquo;s children, Princess Proserfina and Prince Constantino, are separated. Similarly, the son of the Moorish&nbsp;<em>emperador&nbsp;</em>(emperor) disappears. To counter the influence of the Moors, the Christians plot to put up a leader of their own, Miguel. The Moors and Christians continue to be at odds. Meanwhile, the Christian king who is getting older wants his daughter Florencia to find a suitable husband. A&nbsp;<em>torneo&nbsp;</em>(tournament) is called, and princes from far away come to try their luck, including Prince Constantino, Princess Proserfina in male disguise, and the missing Muslim prince. Prince Constantino wins the torneo and the hand of Florencia. After the reunion of Prince Constantino and Princess Proserfina, the two are married and the king passes on the crown of Granada to them. The Muslim emperador and his son are also reunited, and in their happiness are convinced to embrace the Christian faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supported by the community, the komedya is usually presented for two or three days to celebrate the feasts of the barrio patron saints. On an elevated platform dominated by a set representing a two- or three-level European castle, the cast, composed mostly of barrio youths who participate in fulfillment of personal religious vows, declaims the verses and acts out the scenes of love, battle, and royal counsel, while clad in colorful costumes that reveal each character&rsquo;s religion&mdash;dark colors for Christians, red for Moors&mdash;and position in the political hierarchy&mdash;crowns for kings and queens, three-pointed hats for princes. Trained for months by a <strong>direktor</strong>, who often doubles as the <strong>apuntador</strong> (prompter), these <strong>personahe</strong> (cast) do regal&nbsp;<em>marchas&nbsp;</em>(slow marches) and crisp&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\">paso dobles</a>&nbsp;</em>(double-step marches), and dance out their fights to the accompaniment of a brass band.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the centuries, many traditional komedya propounded the belief that all Christians, by virtue of their baptism, are superior to Moors; that Europeans are a race superior to all others because the Christians are European; that authority is hierarchical, with the king dominating and, in descending order, princes, generals, soldiers, and peasants; that authority must be followed at all costs; and that obedience, humility, and perseverance are the hallmarks of a good Christian subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even as the komedya functioned primarily as a piece of dramatic propaganda for the Spanish colonizer, Filipino artists found a way of either neutralizing its colonial messages or by alluding to the less-than-ideal conditions of life under oppressive and racist rulers. To deemphasize or marginalize the anti-Muslim stories of the komedya species called the moro-moro, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a> (1788-1862) created a number of komedya, many with an all-Muslim cast of characters, where the focus was no longer on the conflict between Christians and Moors inevitably ending in the defeat and/or baptism of the latter, but on human relationships and the themes of love, betrayal, power, and honor. Moreover, as was the custom then, Baltazar used the character of the&nbsp;<em>pusong&nbsp;</em>(trickster), the very popular comedian who lightens the ponderous komedya with jokes, whether written or improvised, to allude to various injustices of the colonial regime, such as the abuses committed by the&nbsp;<em>guardia civil&nbsp;</em>(constable) against ordinary&nbsp;<em>indio&nbsp;</em>(Christianized native).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"playlets\" name=\"playlets\"></a>The Playlets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the colonial regime to the present century, the teachings of the Spanish Catholic Church, specifically on the life and sufferings of Jesus Christ and the Catholic saints, and the superiority of Catholicism over all other faiths, have been taught to the Filipino Catholic laity, not only from the book and the pulpit but also from the stage and the street. Revolving around the important seasons of Christmas, Lent, or the feast days of barrio or town patron saints, religious playlets either embroider on the basic, traditional rituals prescribed by the Roman liturgy or create new dialogue and/or music to dramatize an episode in the life of Christ or a saint.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the Christmas plays, the most famous are the Tagalog <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a> (seeking entry) and <strong>pananawagan</strong> (calling out) and the Bikol <strong>kagharong</strong> (going from house to house), which reenact Mary and Joseph&rsquo;s search for an inn on the first Christmas Eve. In Kawit, Cavite, where the panunuluyan is known as the <strong>maytinis</strong>, a young man and a young woman sing their plea to the owners of about five houses&mdash;to no avail. Then a procession of about 13 floats depicts characters from the Old Testament like Adam and Eve, Noah, Moses, David, Esther, and Judith; events from the New Testament, like the Annunciation and Visitation; and an allegory of Mother Philippines. Before midnight, the procession winds up in church. At the &ldquo;Gloria&rdquo; during the midnight mass, the birth of Jesus in a cave is heralded with the singing of little girls dressed as angels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another Christmas playlet is the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> (shepherds). In Bicol towns, pastores refers to a group of young men and women in shepherd costumes who dance and sing Christmas carols in Bikol and Spanish in front of different houses. In Cebu and Leyte, the pastores is a short play depicting the journey of the shepherds to Bethlehem. In Tolosa, Leyte, the pastores features young shepherdesses with full skirts and wide-brimmed hats. Going from house to house, they sing Christmas songs in their native Waray and dance as they search for the Infant Jesus. On their way, the devil tries to block them. They debate with the devil in verse until he goes away. They then proceed on their journey until they find the newly born Messiah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rarest of the Christmas playlets is that of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/479\"><strong>tatlong hari</strong></a> (Three Kings), which is found only in Gasan, Marinduque. Here, the &ldquo;kings&rdquo; parade on horses following a star on a bamboo pole, then end up in front of a stage which depicts Herod&rsquo;s palace. They ask Herod about the baby boy of Bethlehem, depart, and find the Infant Jesus, but fail to return. Herod is livid with anger and sends his soldiers to kill all babies below two years of age. The play ends with Herod going mad and, until a few years ago, destroying the set. In Floridablanca, Pampanga, the tatlong hari is not a play but a procession featuring three men dressed as Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltazar. In Mabitac, Laguna, the kings are played by three boys, who ride on horses from the church to the&nbsp;<em>munisipyo&nbsp;</em>(town hall). From the munisipyo&rsquo;s balcony, they throw candies and money to the screaming crowds below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, on 28 Dec, a play on the <strong>ni&ntilde;os inocentes</strong> (innocent children) used to be performed in Rizal Province to depict the beheading of the innocents by Herod&rsquo;s soldiers. In Gasan, Marinduque, it was a parade of&nbsp;<em>higante&nbsp;</em>(giants) followed by men giving out animal-shaped rice cakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lent features at least nine different playlets that enact different episodes in the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Found in most Catholic parishes all over the Philippines is the Palm Sunday <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a> (hosanna), which is based on the liturgy of Palm Sunday. In Santa Isabel, Malolos, Bulacan, the osana, also called <strong>humenta</strong> (donkey) because it features a&nbsp;<em>karo&nbsp;</em>(float) carrying the image of Christ riding on a donkey, begins with the blessing of the palms in a small&nbsp;<em>visita&nbsp;</em>(chapel) about a kilometer away from the church. From there to the church, the priest who plays Christ leads the faithful in a reenactment of the Savior&rsquo;s triumphal entry into Jerusalem. Stepping over the&nbsp;<em>tapis&nbsp;</em>(overskirts) laid out by devout old women, the priest walks in front of the karo bearing the image of Christ. He stops in front of each of the four&nbsp;<em>kubol&nbsp;</em>(small balconies) placed in equal distances along the route of the procession. On each kubol, little girls in white dresses and carrying little baskets filled with flower petals sing different versions of the &ldquo;Hosanna,&rdquo; praising the Son of David who comes in the name of the Lord to the accompaniment of a brass band. As the procession winds up in the parish church, church bells peal, and the priest then celebrates the Palm Sunday mass.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most parishes, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/483\"><strong>via crucis</strong></a> (way of the cross) is a solemn procession of the image of the Nazarene, usually held on the different Sundays of Lent or on Holy Week. The candlelit procession stops to pray at each of the 14 Stations of the Cross enshrined in various parts of the town. The town of Paete in Laguna boasts of a special via crucis called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> (meeting) on Holy Wednesday for Catholics or Holy Thursday for Aglipayans, and this salubong features moving images manipulated from underneath with an elaborate system of strings and pulleys. Unlike most via crucis, Paete&rsquo;s does not have altars, and stops to reenact only three scenes. On the first corner, the statue of the Nazareno (Christ carrying the cross), standing firm under the weight of the cross, is greeted by the Virgin Mary, whose hands reach out to her son. Later at another corner is the image of Veronica wiping Christ&rsquo;s face with a towel. At the last stop, the Virgin meets Veronica, who shows her the three faces of Christ imprinted on her towel. Throughout the procession, a group of singers provides the dialogue between images in hair-raising, high-pitched chant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most Catholic and Aglipayan parishes today, the liturgical ritual of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/462\"><strong>paghuhugas</strong></a> (washing), which dramatizes the washing of the feet of the apostles by Christ in the Last Supper, is the highlight of Maundy Thursday. In the sanctuary and near the altar, the priest, representing Christ, pours water from a pitcher onto a basin to literally wash and kiss the right foot of each of the 12 parishioners dressed as apostles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some Tagalog and Bicol towns, another reenactment follows the paghuhugas&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/455\"><strong>huling hapunan</strong></a> or <strong>ultima cena</strong> (last supper), which commemorates Jesus&rsquo;s last meal with his apostles. In Gasan, Marinduque, after the washing of the feet, the priest and the 12 apostles proceed from the church to the principal sponsor&rsquo;s house, where they partake of a last supper comprised of popular native fare like sweet-and-sour lapu-lapu, pancit, chopsuey, and rice, as a huddle of women chants the episode on the Last Supper from the Tagalog <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\">pasyon</a>. Later, all spectators partake of the dinner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Good Friday, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/474\"><strong>siete palabras</strong></a> (seven last words) dramatizes Christ&rsquo;s agony on the cross from noon to three in the afternoon. In Santa Elena, Buhi, Camarines Sur, a wooden image of Christ hangs from the cross as laymen give homilies on the Seven Last Words. As each of the last words are spoken by the speaker at the beginning of his homily, two or three blasts of fire are launched into the air by fire blowers near the cross. After Christ dies at three o&rsquo;clock, two men, dressed as Joseph and Nicodemus, take the image down from the cross and lay it out on a stretcher. In a heartrending chant, a woman playing the Virgin weeps and chants an eerie lamentation about Jesus&rsquo;s hair and the wounds in his hands, feet, and side. After the lamentation, the people wipe the image&rsquo;s hands and legs with their handkerchiefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Pakil, Laguna, the highlight of Good Friday is the late afternoon or early evening procession of the <strong>santo entierro</strong> (holy burial). Preceded by the images of San Juan, Maria Cleofe, Maria Salome, Magdalena, and the Mater Dolorosa that are all dressed in black, the image of the dead Christ, which was earlier taken down from the cross from which it hung during the <strong>Siete Palabras</strong>, is carried on a stretcher by devotees. The procession winds its way around the streets of Pakil, preceded by sacristans sounding wooden <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/806\">clappers</a>, which take the place of the regular bells for a more somber tone, and accompanied by a band playing a mournful&nbsp;<em>punebre&nbsp;</em>(funeral march). Then at each of several&nbsp;<em>estaciones&nbsp;</em>(stations) where an altar has been built and decorated with fronds and flowers, as the choir sings the &ldquo;Patawad, O Diyos Ko&rdquo; (Have Mercy, My Lord) to the accompaniment of a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violin</a>, the bearers of Christ&rsquo;s image stop and place the whole stretcher on the altar, under which are containers with live coals burning&nbsp;<em>kamanyang&nbsp;</em>(incense) of dried lanzones and ginger peelings. As prayers are said, the image is smoked like a regular corpse for a few minutes to symbolize the cleansing of all impurities. Then the&nbsp;<em>tambuli&nbsp;</em>(carabao horn) is sounded, and a crier in an eerie voice calls out, &ldquo;Misericordia, Se&ntilde;or&rdquo; (Have mercy, Lord). After this, the bearers take the stretcher on their shoulders once again, and the procession moves to the next estacion where the same rituals are repeated. With the intermittent cries of &ldquo;Misericordia, Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; the doleful sounds of the band, and the slowly moving mass of candle-bearing devotees, the procession ends up in church in the early evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the evening of Good Friday or Black Saturday, a procession called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>soledad</strong></a> (solitude) dramatizes the loneliness of Mary from the death of her son. In Baao, Camarines Sur, the image of a Virgin in black is brought around the&nbsp;<em>poblacion&nbsp;</em>(town proper), accompanied by the karo of San Pedro, San Juan, and Maria Magdalena, among others, and preceded by a group of young musicians called the&nbsp;<em>estudiantina</em>. The procession stops in front of several houses where singers comfort the Virgin with songs in Latin like the &ldquo;Ave Maria.&rdquo; On the eve of Easter Sunday, plays depicting the Resurrection of Jesus Christ are performed in some towns. The Resurrection play of Lubao, Pampanga, written in the 1920s, uses special effects. So does the new <strong>pagkabuhay</strong> in Angono, Rizal, where the events leading to the Resurrection are enacted by the townspeople on a stage in the church plaza on Black Saturday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular in many Catholic and Aglipayan parishes all over the country, the <strong>salubong</strong> (meeting), which is also known as <strong>padafung</strong>, <strong>encuentro</strong>, <strong>sugat</strong>, <strong>sabet</strong>, and <strong>alleluya</strong>, reenacts the meeting of the Virgin and the Risen Christ in the early morning of Easter Sunday. One of the grandest salubong is found in Angono, Rizal. This opens with a spirited dance of the&nbsp;<em>tinyenta&nbsp;</em>(female lieutenant), who waves a short flag. After this, the&nbsp;<em>kapitana&nbsp;</em>(female captain) declaims a long poem speaking of the fulfillment of Christ&rsquo;s promise. Then birds of bamboo and paper swoop down from the corners of the four-poster structure called&nbsp;<em>galilee</em>, which has a heart hanging at the center that conceals the little angel of the salubong. The angel is then lowered toward the image of the Virgin below. As the angel sing the Latin Antiphon &ldquo;Regina Coeli, Laetare&rdquo; (Queen of Heaven, Rejoice), together with the other angels on the ground, she slowly takes off the Virgin&rsquo;s black veil to signify that the latter&rsquo;s Son had indeed risen from the dead. The salubong is capped with the kapitana&rsquo;s dance of exaltation featuring a flag emblazoned with the word &ldquo;Mabuhay&rdquo; (Long Live).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Marinduque, the main feature of the Easter celebration is still the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/459\"><strong>moryonan</strong></a> or <strong>moriones</strong> (literally, helmets). Wearing folk interpretations of Roman soldiers&rsquo;s costumes, male penitents dramatize the story of the soldier Longhino who pierced the side of Christ but who was later convinced of Christ&rsquo;s divinity when he witnessed the Resurrection. Pilate and the Pharisees try to pay him off to keep quiet about what he saw. He refuses and instead runs around the town telling everyone about the risen Christ. Pilate sends his soldiers after Longhino, who is then captured and finally beheaded&mdash;that is, his helmet is impaled on a wooden sword and held up for all to see.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the triumph of good, evil must be punished. <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/454\"><strong>Hudas</strong></a></strong>, the ritual burning of Judas Iscariot, is still performed in some Bulacan and Pampanga towns on Easter Sunday. In Santa Rita, Pampanga, the bamboo-and-paper effigy of the traitor Judas Iscariot stands on a bamboo pole in the church patio in the middle of four bamboo posts located near the four corners of the large patio. After the Easter morning mass, churchgoers gather to witness the punishment of the traitor. Christian tradition teaches that Judas&rsquo;s body hanging from a tree was eaten up by black birds. Thus the firecrackers&mdash;coming from each of the bamboo poles in each of the corners&mdash;are masked with cardboard figures of black birds. Each of these birds, once &ldquo;lighted,&rdquo; rides on a cable connecting the post to Judas&rsquo;s hands and feet. This way, the birds are made to swoop down to &ldquo;devour&rdquo; the limbs of his body. In the end, the torso and, finally, the head are blown up, as the audience of elders and youths scream with delight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playlets are likewise performed to celebrate the feasts of patron saints. In some towns in Dumaguete, Negros Oriental, the playlet in Cebuano called <strong>San Jose</strong> used to feature a man, a woman, and a child dressed as San Jose, the Virgen, and the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, respectively, walking around town and finally presiding over the feast prepared by a sponsor. Sometime in May in Camarines Norte, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/448\"><strong>dotoc</strong></a> shows a group of pilgrims joining up with another group going to Persia to pay homage to the Holy Cross, while the <strong>lagaylay</strong> features dances by Queen Elena and her son Constantino, accompanied by flag bearers and guards of honor, as they sing antiphonal verses in search and praise of the Holy Cross. On the feast of San Martin de Tours in October and that of the Virgin of Caysasay in December, several young people of Taal perform the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>lua</strong></a> (praise), a long poem that expresses the gratitude of the people of Taal to their patron saints for favors received as well as their prayer for the continued protection of their town from all calamities, natural and man-made. These poems are declaimed by the <strong>luwante</strong> on a stage before the image of the patron saint when the procession stops in front of the luwante&rsquo;s house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 19th century, the most important playlet staged to honor a patron saint was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/458\"><strong>moros y cristianos</strong></a>, performed by rural folk on the street. Invariably, this dance drama focused on the clash between the Christians and the Moors or non-Christians. On the feast of Santiago on 25 Jul, the Cebuano <strong>kinabayo</strong> (literally, using horses) of Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte, reenacts the Battle of Covadonga, which supposedly happened in 718 AD, where Santiago came down from the sky on his white horse to help the Christians under Pelayo defeat the Moors under Alkamah. In Ivana, Batanes, on the feast of San Jose on 1 May, three groups of males&mdash;young, middle-aged, old&mdash;perform the <strong>palo-palo</strong> (fighting with sticks), which depicts a battle between the Christians and the Moors. In Cabagan, Isabela, the feast of Santo Domingo is celebrated on 8 Aug with the <strong>sambali</strong>, a choreographed street fight between the Christian Ibanag and the non-Christian Kalinga. In Ibajay, Aklan, the <strong>sayaw</strong> (dance), which is an offering to the patron Santo Ni&ntilde;o every third Sunday of January, features Moorish ambassadors being sent to the Christian Bisaya (Visayan) and a grand battle between the two armies that ends in the defeat of the Moors. The same playlet is called <strong>sinulog</strong> in Calbiga, Western Samar, <strong>curaldal</strong> or <strong>batalla</strong> in some towns of Pampanga, and <strong>maglalatik</strong> or <strong>magbabao</strong> in Bi&ntilde;an, Laguna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A variation of the moros y cristianos is the <strong>bakahan</strong> (battle) of San Antonio, Laguna, a unique play performed from two to three in the afternoon of Good Friday. The bakahan dramatizes the fight between San Miguel Arcangel, here played by a boy of about 10, and the <strong>hudyo</strong> (Jews) played by older boys in bizarre masks and costumes. Unique to San Antonio, this story highlights the struggle between good and evil in the hour before Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of these playlets flourish to our day because of the support of individuals, civic organizations, and even local government who continue to believe in the teachings of the Catholic religion, in spite of the inroads of mass media and the &ldquo;modern scientific culture.&rdquo; As in the past, participation in or sponsorship of these events is a&nbsp;<em>panata&nbsp;</em>(vow), believed to be efficacious in conciliating and persuading Christian deities to grant personal wishes. Moreover, the playlets perform an important social function. Since they involve all classes and sectors of the barrio or town, they effectively reaffirm the values and beliefs shared by the community, thereby strengthening the individual&rsquo;s commitment to society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"sinakulo\" name=\"sinakulo\"></a>The Sinakulo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sinakulo (literally, cenacle) or passion play probably began as a dramatization of the events depicted in the first&nbsp;<em>pasyon</em>, the <strong><em>Mahal na Passion</em></strong> (The Holy Passion), 1703, by Gaspar Aquino de Belen. By the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th, the sinakulo became a formal play with sets and costumes, performed by traveling commercial troupes like the Cenaculistang Pasay in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>teatro</strong></a> (theater), on the open-air <strong>entablado</strong> (stage), and in the&nbsp;<em>sabungan&nbsp;</em>(cockpit) in the barrios of Bulacan and Rizal. Soon Pampanga and Bicol began to organize their own community sinakulo, which usually took the whole of the Semana Santa (Holy Week) to perform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it exists today, the sinakulo is a play written in verse (octosyllabic&nbsp;<em>quintillas</em>) or in prose, dramatizing the history of salvation&mdash;from the creation of the world and the first human beings to the assumption and coronation of the Virgin Mary in heaven, but paying special attention to the life, sufferings, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Other names for the passion play are <strong>tanggal</strong> (deposition) in Bicol, <strong>taltal</strong> (nailing) in Negros, and <strong>pasion y muerte</strong> (passion and death) in many towns. A shorter form of the sinakulo focusing on the events from the Agony in the Garden to the Crucifixion is usually presented on Good Friday morning and afternoon. These shorter versions are the <strong>pagdakip</strong> in Malolos, Bulacan, or the <strong>penitensiya</strong> in Cainta, Rizal. In Cutud, San Fernando, Pampanga, the sinakulo ends up with the actual nailing on the cross of the penitent playing Christ. Over the years the number of penitents being nailed to the cross has increased that Cutud has become a favorite tourist destination every Good Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>sinakulo orihinal</strong> uses the popular <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g&nbsp;<strong>Genesis</strong></em></strong></a> as its basic text, following the pasyon&rsquo;s chronology of events and lifts stanzas of dialogue from its episodes. To these are added stories and stanzas taken from the religious awit and korido from other pasyon like the <strong><em>Pasyong Candaba</em></strong> and <strong><em>Pasyon Truncalis</em></strong>, from popular magazines like <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></strong></em></strong>, from religious novels like <strong><em>Martir sa Golgota</em></strong> (Martyr of Golgotha), from other sinakulo scripts, and lately, from &ldquo;Lenten&rdquo; movies like the <strong><em>Ten Commandments</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Robe</em></strong>, <strong><em>Quo Vadis</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jesus of&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Nazareth</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Passion of the Christ</em></strong>. A full sinakulo script would include the following scenes: the seven days of creation, the temptation of Adam and Eve in paradise, the tragedy of Cain and Abel, the flood and Noah&rsquo;s ark, the birth, education and wedding of the Virgin, the Annunciation, the Visitation, Christ&rsquo;s nativity, his debate with the doctors in the temple, his recollection in the desert, the miracles in Jesus&rsquo;s public ministry, the events starting from his entry to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday to his resurrection on Easter Sunday, the Ascension, the descent of the Holy Spirit, and the assumption and coronation of the Virgin in heaven. Apocryphal stories relating to Herod the Great, Magdalena, Boanerhes, Dimas, Barabas, and Samuel Belibet may also be included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Presented at the public plaza during Lent and especially on Holy Week, the sinakulo uses a proscenium-type stage in the open air. Different types of <strong>telon</strong> (backdrop) situate the action of the scenes, while props, often with no sense of history, are used as required by the scenes. The whole production usually has a main director, who is assisted by the directors for music, sets, and lights. The sinakulo&rsquo;s <strong>personahe</strong> or characters, who perform in fulfillment of religious vows, may use the traditional chant and marches or declaim prose dialogue to canned music. Traditionally, costumes follow those worn by the images of Christ and the saints on Holy Week processions, but nowadays they are imitations of those seen in movies about Christ and the Roman times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even when they use modern staging techniques, most contemporary sinakulo continue to propagate values of passivity and blind obedience by highlighting Christ as the model of subservience, a God who is meek as a lamb, and a savior who accepts all the torture inflicted on him with total humility. Such values went a long way in convincing indios to meekly accept all economic and political impositions of the Spanish colonizer for centuries. Today, such passivity and obedience continue to shape contemporary minds, making them noncritical, acquiescent, and predisposed to follow authoritarian rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"sarsuwela\" name=\"sarsuwela\"></a>The Sarsuwela</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish zarzuela was introduced in Manila in 1878 or 1879, through the performance of <strong><em>Jugar con Fuego</em></strong> (Playing with Fire) by the troupe of Dario Cespedes. In the following years, more groups arrived, notably that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2865\">Alejandro Cubero</a>, which presented the zarzuela not only in Manila but in Iloilo, Cebu, Pampanga, and Bicol. Inspired by this new &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; form, Filipinos soon created their own original zarzuela&mdash;the <strong>sarsuwela</strong> &mdash;in Tagalog, Pampango, Ilocano, Pangasinan, Cebuano, Ilonggo, and Waray. The sarsuwela thrived from 1900 to 1940 because of mass support and elite sponsorship, and because of its portrayal of familiar characters, conditions, and concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the rise of bodabil and the movies in the pre-World War II era, the sarsuwela slowly migrated from stage to screen until it was replaced by the Hollywood-type musical. Today, the traditional sarsuwela is still staged in the Ilocos and a few other towns, while its revitalized form is sometimes done in Manila and in Silay City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sarsuwela is a play that is comprised of one to five acts, with songs and dances, and is generally in prose, less often in verse. It portrays typical Filipino situations within the framework of a love story and incorporates contemporary issues. Sarsuwela may depict lofty themes such as love of country during a time of revolution, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong><em>Walang Sugat</em></strong></a> (No Wounds), 1902; satirize the foibles of Filipinos who suffer from colonial mentality, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong><em>Paglipas ng Dilim</em></strong></a> (After the Darkness), 1920; narrate an entertaining love story of children and parents separated at birth, as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/503\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ng Dagat</em></strong> </a>(Child of the Sea), 1921; or comment on social climbing and marriages of convenience as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong><em>Dalagang Bukid</em></strong></a> (Country Maiden), 1919.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important sarsuwela is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/650\"><strong><em>Sa Bunganga ng&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Pating</em></strong></a> (At the Mercy of Sharks), 1921. The beautiful Nati, daughter of the landlord Don Juan, has just graduated as a pharmacist. The widower Don Juan and his fianc&eacute;, Do&ntilde;a Irene, both notorious usurers, plan to marry her off to a person with influence and money, but Nati loves Mario, the son of the peasants Andong and Maria, who are indebted to Don Juan. Meanwhile, at Nati&rsquo;s party, Mario introduces Marcelo, who has been sent by the government to establish rural credit for farmers to save them from usurious practices. Later, when Andong and Maria try to pay off their debt to Don Juan, they are shocked to find out that it has more than quintupled in two years&rsquo; time. Because Andong cannot pay the huge amount, Don Juan sends the police to confiscate his properties. Andong appeals to the courts, but the judge, who is Don Juan&rsquo;s friend, sides with the latter. In desperation, the farmers harvest the rice from Don Juan&rsquo;s fields for themselves. Don Juan blames Mario for this, despite Nati&rsquo;s explanation that it is Mario who protects Don Juan&rsquo;s interests. Angry, Don Juan goes to confront the peasants who chase him all the way to his house. Mario intervenes and protects him. Marcelo explains that the court has reversed its decision and will ask Andong to pay back only the original amount that he had borrowed. Don Juan accepts the court&rsquo;s decision, reconciles with Andong and Maria, and accepts Mario as his daughter&rsquo;s fianc&eacute;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the early decades of the 20th century, the sarsuwela has been presented by commercial troupes like the&nbsp;<em>compa&ntilde;ias&nbsp;</em>of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a> in the early 1900s, in the teatros of big cities like Manila, Iloilo, and Cebu or on open-air entablado in rural areas during town fiestas where they are sponsored by&nbsp;<em>hermanos mayores</em>, usually in fulfilment of a panata to the patron saint of the town in whose honor it is being performed. Painted <strong>telones</strong> provide the setting for scenes (e.g., facade of a rich man or poor man&rsquo;s house, interior of a rich man or poor man&rsquo;s house, a rural landscape), and are complemented with appropriate props (e.g., sala sets for the houses of the rich, benches for poor abodes). Acting and costumes identify the <strong>bida</strong> (protagonist) and the <strong>kontrabida</strong> (antagonist). A small or big orchestra accompanies the songs, which usually include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><em>kundiman</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/442\"><em>balitaw</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/770\"><em>balse</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>danza</em>, fox-trot, and later, cha-cha, rock and roll, and twist or whatever is popular at a given period. An overall director (or principal director) rehearses the actors, often acts as impresario as well, and coordinates the work of the <strong>maestro</strong> (music director and band master), who subcontracts musicians, rehearses and conducts them on stage, and rehearses the singing of the actors; the <strong>telonero</strong> (telon person), who works the telones and sets up the props; the <strong>electricista</strong> (electrician), who takes care of the lights and special effects; the <strong>apuntador</strong> or <strong>diktador</strong> (prompter), who feeds the lines to the actors from a <strong>concha</strong> (shell) in front of the entablado; and all the other cast and crew connected with the production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it first bloomed in the 1900s, the sarsuwela was rightly regarded as an &ldquo;enlightened&rdquo; form of theater because it introduced a more realistic way of depicting reality, reorienting the Filipino&rsquo;s eyes from the fantasy of European kingdoms of the komedya to the social evils confronting him in his time, like oppressive landlords, corrupt politicians, gambling, usury, and colonial mentality. However, although it presented characters, situations, and problems drawn from real life, it painted these characters as types according to the bida and kontrabida mode, and contented itself with describing a range of social and political problems but then solving them in a conciliatory fashion, reducing class contradictions and structural injustice into personal problems. In this sense and in spite of its social conscience, the sarsuwela propagated a worldview and a value system that in the final analysis strengthened the status quo at the expense of the ordinary people who comprised the bulk of its audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"drama\" name=\"drama\"></a>The Drama</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drama was brought into the country by Spanish troupes, many of whom came after the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Although these groups presented principally Spanish melodramas in the theaters of Manila, they also did prose plays without music called &ldquo;drama&rdquo; (to be distinguished from &ldquo;drama&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;play&rdquo; in general in English), which were written by Manila artists. Among the first drama written in Spanish by Filipino-born Spaniards and Spanish mestizos were <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/533\"><strong>Cuadros Filipinos</strong></a></em></strong> (Philippine Scenes), 1882, and <strong><em>Jose el Carpintero</em></strong> (Joseph the Carpenter), 1880. Two of the early dramas written in the native languages were <strong><em>Ang Babai nga</em></strong> <em><strong>Huwaran</strong> </em>(The Model Woman), 1878, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/648\"><strong>R.I.P.</strong></a></em></strong>, 1901.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drama is a play in prose that revolves around Filipino characters and situations, emphasizing current issues. Sometimes, the drama may feature a song or two to create mood and provide relief from long stretches of dialogue. Dramas were often performed together with the sarsuwela. Sometimes, three of these dramas were combined for an evening&rsquo;s performance. During the Japanese occupation, the drama was incorporated into the <strong>bodabil</strong> (local vaudeville) as its main feature, creating a new form called the <strong>stage show</strong>. As the movies drew audiences away from the theaters, the romantic melodramas and the comic dramas, like the sarsuwela, transferred to the screen and were known as &ldquo;drama&rdquo; and &ldquo;komedi.&rdquo; Today, the same drama and komedi are heard over the radio or are seen on television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drama has three general types: the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\"><strong>drama simboliko</strong></a>, which allegorizes stock characters from the romantic drama to comment on a political/social situation, like <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/673\"><strong>Tanikalang Guinto</strong></a></em></strong> (Golden Chain), 1902; the <strong>drama romantiko</strong> which focuses on a love or family story that may end happily or tragically, like <strong><em>Esperanza</em></strong>, 1916; and the <strong>drama comico</strong> or <strong>comedy</strong>, which may use any kind of plot or character in order to create situations, whether satirical, farcical, or slapstick, that will make people laugh, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/615\"><strong><em>Mga Santong Tao</em></strong></a> (People Saints), 1901.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1902, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2711\">Juan Abad</a> and his group of relatives and friends staged <strong><em>Tanikalang Guinto</em></strong> at the Teatro Libertad in Manila. It later caused the author&rsquo;s incarceration because it exposed America as the new colonizer. In this drama, Liwanag (meaning &ldquo;light,&rdquo; representing a free Philippines) is being courted by Kaulayaw (meaning &ldquo;sweetheart,&rdquo; representing Filipinos fighting for freedom). But Liwanag&rsquo;s uncle, Maimbot (&ldquo;greedy,&rdquo; representing the United States), puts obstacles to their marriage (freedom of the Philippines). Maimbot gifts Liwanag with a golden bracelet to take her mind away from Kaulayaw, but she is loyal to Kaulayaw. Angry, Maimbot ties her to a tree with the golden bracelet, which now becomes a golden chain, and pays Nagtapon ( &ldquo;a wastrel,&rdquo; representing Filipinos who had collaborated with the Americans) to guard Liwanag and keep Kaulayaw, Nagtapon&rsquo;s brother, away from her. When Kaulayaw tries to save Liwanag, Nagtapon kills him. Liwanag despairs and wants to kill herself but Diwa (representing the spirit of struggle) enters and tells her that Kaulayaw will be brought back to life. In the final tableau, Nagtapon is taken away by the devil and Maimbot by Death. As Liwanag and Diwa are carried to the skies in a bubble, Kaulayaw is crowned by Bat (God).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the sarsuwela, the drama draws its themes, characters, and stories from current issues, whether these be political, religious, or social. A typical romantic drama is <strong><em>Manotok</em></strong> by Makahiya [pseud]. Mariano, a poor fisherman, catches his wife Lucia with her lover Don Alvaro, the landlord. Alvaro escapes, and Mariano, in anger, strangles his wife to death. The police arrest Mariano who is then sentenced to a prison term of 15 years. As Mariano serves his term, Pining, Mariano&rsquo;s daughter, is raised by a kind farmer, Mang Kiko. Pretty and kind Pining, who runs a little&nbsp;<em>bibingka&nbsp;</em>(rice cake) stall, is courted by Arturo, a handsome lieutenant. Mang Kiko approves of Pining&rsquo;s suitor and everything goes well until Don Alvaro, back from months of traveling abroad, asks to see his tenant Mang Kiko. Alvaro is attracted to Pining and tries to take her by force. She resists and slaps him. When he persists, Manotok, the idiot whom Pining had been kind to, hits Alvaro with a piece of wood. In retaliation, Alvaro dismisses Mang Kiko as his tenant. To make matters worse, Mang Kiko goes blind. In the midst of this double tragedy, Arturo proposes marriage to Pining, and the latter accepts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, Alvaro has a heated discussion with Mary, a&nbsp;<em>bailarina&nbsp;</em>(nightclub dancer) whom he lives with, who demands that Alvaro make good his promise of marriage to her. Alvaro insults Mary and drives her out of the house. As Mary leaves the house, the idiot Manotok enters Alvaro&rsquo;s house, picks up a letter Mary drops, and goes away with another letter he takes from Alvaro&rsquo;s desk. Meanwhile, Alvaro follows Mary to Mang Kiko&rsquo;s house, kills her, and frames Mang Kiko so he would be blamed for the crime. Arturo has the painful duty of arresting his future father-in-law, who gives himself up peacefully. At the trial presided over by a young idealistic judge (Alvaro&rsquo;s son), Manotok reveals himself to be Mariano coming to claim justice for himself. Using the letters he got from Alvaro&rsquo;s house, Mariano proves that Alvaro had an affair with his wife and that it was Alvaro who killed Mary. Mang Kiko is exonerated, and Pining and her father are reunited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the sarsuwela, the drama was presented commercially on the open-air entablado in the provinces during fiestas. Using telones and appropriate props, the drama was performed by professional or by community actors sometimes called <strong>dramista</strong>, who were taught the techniques of acting for melodrama or for comedy. A director-impresario took charge of fees and arrangements, and hired and supervised actors, composer-conductors, set and property masters, electricians, and other crew members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most dramas, like the typical sarsuwela of the pre-World War II period, depicted familiar characters, issues, and situations. However, like the sarsuwela, the drama usually reduced real economic and political contradictions to personal conflicts that could therefore be more easily resolved by the reconciliation of opponents, the contrition and forgiveness of the offenders, the conviction of the culprit or, as in most cases, the change of heart of the gambler, the prostitute, the usurer, or the corrupt politician. A major exception to these types of dramas was the allegorical dramas of 1902 to 1905. These dramas, in spite of the anti-sedition law enforced by the Americans and the threat of incarceration, successfully exposed the political contradiction between Filipino nationalists who fought for the independence earlier won from Spain and the American colonizers who pretended to help the Philippine Revolution against Spain but were now taking that independence away from the Filipinos because of their own colonial intentions. Here for the first time is drama that does not reaffirm but seeks to overthrow a new colonial status quo established through political deceit and superior arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"epilogue\" name=\"epilogue\"></a>Epilogue</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most komedya, sinakulo, sarsuwela, and drama continue to propagate ideas that lead to divisiveness (e.g., Muslims are bad, Christians are good), passivity (e.g., to be Christlike submissiveness is always good), authoritarianism (e.g., &ldquo;Utos ng hari, hindi mababali,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s word cannot be broken&rdquo;), and blind acceptance of the status quo (e.g., it is not social structures that are oppressive but abusive individuals). Clearly, values such as these can hardly be called progressive, especially in a new nation such as the Philippines which is trying to create a critical citizenry as well as unity among its varied sectors. Given the continuing popularity of these forms among provincial audiences, however, contemporary playwrights have seen fit to inject into these plays themes and conflicts that are more consonant with current concerns. In 1962, Max Allanigue rejected the divisive messages of the traditional komedya in his <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/646\"><strong>Prinsipe Rodante</strong></a></em></strong> (Prince Rodante), which argues that one is bad not because of one&rsquo;s religion but because one does not respect justice. In 1983, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a> reshaped the komedya in his <strong><em>Sandaang Panaginip</em></strong> (A Hundred Dreams), which satirizes a kingdom (the Philippines) made bankrupt by the extravagance of its queen (Imelda Marcos). In 1992, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> produced <strong><em><strong><strong>Florante</strong></strong> at Laura</em></strong> (Florante and Laura) in komedya form for the grade school students of Dongalo, Para&ntilde;aque, to encourage the youth to revitalize the komedya with messages that are no longer anti-Muslim but anti-authoritarianism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christ story has likewise been reinterpreted according to current conditions. As early as 1907, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bagong Kristo</em></strong> (New Christ) portrayed Christ as a labor leader, who organizes the workers in the city and the countryside to demand decent wages from landlords and factory owners. From 1988 to 1992, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3243\">Al Santos</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kalbaryo ng Maralitang&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Tagalungsod</em></strong> (Calvary of the Urban Poor) focused on the plight of the Manila urban poor, whose calvary is a garbage dump called Smokey Mountain and whose crosses are the various anti-poor ordinances issued by the local government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of all the traditional forms, it is the sarsuwela that has had the most number of innovations. In 1977, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/525\"><strong><em>Ang Bundok</em></strong></a> (The Mountain) showed the Cordillera groups linking arms to fight foreigners mining their lands. In 1976, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5435\">Domingo Landicho</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sumpang Mahal</em></strong> (Sacred Vow) satirized the colonial mentality of Filipino balikbayan. In 1980, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5197\">Isagani R.Cruz</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ms.</em></strong> <em><strong>Philippines</strong> </em>exposed the dreams and frustrations of beauty-contest participants. In 1982, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907) underscored the conflict between pro-American and pro-Filipino forces in the political, cultural, and economic levels. In 1998, four new sarsuwela were declared winners in the sarsuwela competition sponsored by the National Centennial Commission. Top prize was won by <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/639\"><strong>Palasyo ni Valentin</strong></a></em></strong> (Valentin&rsquo;s Palace) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>, which depicted a gothic love triangle between a Spanish theater impresario, an aspiring native sarsuwela star, and the latter&rsquo;s indio suitor. The second prize was shared by <strong><em>Paglayang Minamahal</em></strong> (Beloved Freedom) by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2874\">George de Jesus III</a>, a love story set during the Philippine revolution of 1896; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/557\"><strong>Hibik at Himagsik nina Victoria Laktaw Atbp.</strong></a></em></strong> (Plea and Revolt of Victoria Laktaw and Others) by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>, a story about American abuse of women during the Philippine-American War; and <strong><em>Bayan, Isang Paa na Lamang</em></strong> (Nation: Just One Foot Left) by Melba Padilla Maggay, about the EDSA Revolt and its relation to the 1896 Revolution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These attempts at revitalization prove that the creative use of traditional dramas for aesthetic expression on contemporary realities is not only possible but necessary, acquiring new meaning for contemporary audiences. If these attempts succeed, these plays will not only help form a new citizenry and nation but also prove themselves significant enough to be considered pillars of a Filipino national theater. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><strong>Nicanor G.

In 1609, the komedya on the martyrdom of Santa Barbara, the first in a native language, facilitated the conversion of the Boholanos to Christianity. Later, in 1637, a famous komedya depicted the defeat of Corralat (Kudarat) at the hands of Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera. In the 18th century, the komedya depicting conflicts in distant medieval European kingdoms began to be staged. By the 19th century, the komedya had become an institution in Manila theaters and soon after became popular fiesta fare&#x2014;in Pampanga by the 1830s, in the Ilocos by the 1850s, in Bicol by the 1860s, and in Iloilo and Cebu toward the end of the 19th century. In spite of the attacks on the komedya and the rise of the sarsuwela in the 1900s and bodabil in the 1920s, the komedya still attracted rural audiences even after World War II. Today, the mass media, especially film, has effectively eliminated many traditional drama forms, but the komedya survives in a few towns all over the islands."

At present, the komedya may be divided into two principal types. The first, which may be called <strong>komedya de santo</strong>, centers on the lives of patron saints, like the <strong><em>Comedia de San Miguel</em></strong> (Play of San Miguel) of Iligan City; the miracles wrought by these saints, like the <strong><em>Haybing</em></strong> of Taal, Batangas; or on certain episodes in the life of a saint or of Christ, like the <strong><em>Comedia de Misterio</em></strong> (Play of Mystery) of Paete, Laguna. The second and more secular type of komedya, also known as <strong>kumidya</strong>, <strong>moro-moro</strong>, <strong>linambay</strong>, <strong>coloquio</strong>, <strong>araquio</strong>, <strong>tibag</strong>, and <strong>minoros</strong>, may highlight the epic battles between Christian kingdoms in medieval Europe (e.g., Francia, Espa&#xF1;a, Italia, Alemania, Albania) and the Moorish kingdoms of the Middle East (e.g., Turquia, Persia, Arabia), as seen in <strong><em>Doce Pares de Francia</em></strong> (Twelve Peers of France); or the lives and loves of noble Christian or Muslim characters, as seen, respectively, in <strong><em>Don Alejandre y</em></strong> <em><strong>Don Luis</strong> </em>(Don Alejandro and Don Luis) and&#xA0;<em><strong><a href=\"/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></strong> </em>(Orosman and Zafira)."

The arrogant Lusbel resents the prohibition and disobeys God&#x2019;s order. God then summons San Miguel to put Lusbel in line, but Lusbel is unrepentant. Holding God&#x2019;s banner and sword, San Miguel rallies his band of good angels and engages Lusbel and his group of rebels in a decisive battle. Lusbel and his cohorts are defeated and consigned to the fires of hell forever. In part 2, which is popularly known as &#x201C;Yawa-Yawa,&#x201D; literally &#x201C;Devil-Devil,&#x201D; individual demons wearing red costumes and masks and outdoing each other in fun and fantasy, introduce themselves and the evils they represent (including the seven capital sins), while Lusbel, who has been turned into a seven-headed monster, looks on. Part 3, which has not been performed for some time, dramatizes a morality tale contrasting the lives of a rich man who lives a life of indulgence and sin and ends up in hell, and a hermit who denies himself the pleasures of the world and ends up in heaven."

The Christians lose, the king dies, and in the confusion that follows, the king&#x2019;s children, Princess Proserfina and Prince Constantino, are separated. Similarly, the son of the Moorish&#xA0;<em>emperador&#xA0;</em>(emperor) disappears. To counter the influence of the Moors, the Christians plot to put up a leader of their own, Miguel. The Moors and Christians continue to be at odds. Meanwhile, the Christian king who is getting older wants his daughter Florencia to find a suitable husband. A&#xA0;<em>torneo&#xA0;</em>(tournament) is called, and princes from far away come to try their luck, including Prince Constantino, Princess Proserfina in male disguise, and the missing Muslim prince. Prince Constantino wins the torneo and the hand of Florencia. After the reunion of Prince Constantino and Princess Proserfina, the two are married and the king passes on the crown of Granada to them. The Muslim emperador and his son are also reunited, and in their happiness are convinced to embrace the Christian faith."

Moreover, as was the custom then, Baltazar used the character of the&#xA0;<em>pusong&#xA0;</em>(trickster), the very popular comedian who lightens the ponderous komedya with jokes, whether written or improvised, to allude to various injustices of the colonial regime, such as the abuses committed by the&#xA0;<em>guardia civil&#xA0;</em>(constable) against ordinary&#xA0;<em>indio&#xA0;</em>(Christianized native)."

However, although it presented characters, situations, and problems drawn from real life, it painted these characters as types according to the bida and kontrabida mode, and contented itself with describing a range of social and political problems but then solving them in a conciliatory fashion, reducing class contradictions and structural injustice into personal problems. In this sense and in spite of its social conscience, the sarsuwela propagated a worldview and a value system that in the final analysis strengthened the status quo at the expense of the ordinary people who comprised the bulk of its audiences."

A major exception to these types of dramas was the allegorical dramas of 1902 to 1905. These dramas, in spite of the anti-sedition law enforced by the Americans and the threat of incarceration, successfully exposed the political contradiction between Filipino nationalists who fought for the independence earlier won from Spain and the American colonizers who pretended to help the Philippine Revolution against Spain but were now taking that independence away from the Filipinos because of their own colonial intentions.

In the decades that followed and even beyond American rule that ended in 1946, what came into the country were the American forms of art, and with them, the European, too&mdash;specifically, the English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American tradition in Philippine theater is evidenced in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>; the Western plays done in the English language or translated in Filipino; and the original plays produced by contemporary theater actors which use styles like theater of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/440\">absurd</a>, epic theater, expressionism, and various forms of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\">realism</a>. The American tradition entered the Philippine stage principally through the educational system established in 1901 and since then has continued, developing with fresh inputs; merging with or transforming traditional theater; siring translations and adaptations; participating in the formation of new playwrights, new trends, new theater; and on the whole, contributing ideas and energy to Philippine theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The colonizers who arrived in the Philippines to establish the American Insular Government came upon a theater scene they could not understand. They found religious dramas and dramatizations, long &ldquo;hyperbolic&rdquo; verse plays, and the plays they came to call &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; because these had the temerity to espouse Philippine independence from the United States. Even if Arthur Riggs, military journalist and eyewitness, did not consider the Filipino stage worthy of the name &ldquo;theater,&rdquo; the native dramatic tradition continued to flourish in the form of the rites and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/432#rituals\">rituals</a>, verse debates, songs and dances of the indigenous theater, as well as folk theater represented by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, and the budding <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>. Each simply found its place on the different stages, whether outdoors or indoors, in barrios, towns, and cities, with its own audience, whether paying or not, during religious feast days, town fiestas, civic occasions, and eventually evenings at the theater. Inevitably, however, the entry of a new culture would have its indelible effect on the Filipino stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"bodabil\" name=\"bodabil\"></a>Bodabil</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaudeville was the first visible influence from America. Although a French form, it was adapted in the United States as a show made up of an assortment of entertainment numbers. These shows composed of songs and dances, magic and music acts, skits and stand-up comedy, and chorus girls and comedians, were first brought in to entertain the American soldiers at about the turn of the century. They entertained the native audience as well, who found them convenient and portable showcases for entertainment spectacles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The songs and dances of bodabil, vaudeville&rsquo;s Filipinized word (<em>vodavil</em>, for writers in Spanish) were fill-ins between short sarsuwela or between acts of a long one. They were called <strong>stage shows</strong> during the Japanese occupation, and much later, <strong>variety shows</strong>. In some provinces, the bodabil intermissions were called <strong>jamboree</strong>, a word that had originally been applied to the opening musical numbers of stage shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodabil eventually went on stage in such venues as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a> and the Savoy Theater (later Clover Theater), forming images of what entertainment was in the minds of Filipino audiences. Bodabil-type acts appeared on political stages and decades later deteriorated into burlesque and strip shows in cheap theaters in suburbs or around the American bases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it reigned, bodabil created musical trends and performance genres, and helped establish the careers of musicians and other performers. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\">Lou Borromeo</a> tuned to <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779#the%20american%20era%20(1898-1945)\">jazz</a> music. Dancers like Benny Mack and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a>, called &ldquo;the Filipino Fred Astaire,&rdquo; comic magicians like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2813\">Canuplin</a> who was billed as &ldquo;the local Chaplin,&rdquo; a superb torch singer a la Sophie Tucker called <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a>, singers like Diana Toy and Miami Salvador, and much later, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4546\">Eddie Mesa</a>, &ldquo;the Filipino Elvis Presley,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\">Diomedes Maturan</a>, &ldquo;the local Perry Como,&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\">Nora Aunor</a> who started as &ldquo;the Pinay Timi Yuro,&rdquo; all became popular in the following decades, proving how limber Filipino entertainers were&mdash;how easy it was for them to tune in to American rhythms. Their rise also showed the impact and influence of American popular entertainment and how painless and effective a tool popular culture was in the Americanization of the Filipino. The songs, dances, and entertainment forms of most Filipinos until the 1960s were undeniably patterned after &ldquo;the American dream.&rdquo; In American popular culture were embodied, for decades, their images of beauty and excellence, of life and self.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodabil may have lapsed in popularity, but productions still occasionally feature this form or personalities from the bodabil era, such as in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association&rsquo;s (PETA)</a> play <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/527\"><strong><em>Canuplin</em></strong></a>, 1980, written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3148\">Manny Pambid</a>, which centered on the life of bodabil star Canuto Francia; Musical Theater Philippines&rsquo;s musical <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/581\"><strong><em>Katy!</em></strong></a>, 1988, music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a> and libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4631\">Jose Javier Reyes</a>, a biography of the &ldquo;Queen of Philippine Bodabil&rdquo; Katy de la Cruz; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/670\"><strong>Stageshow</strong></a></em></strong>, 2012, libretto by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a> and music by Jeffrey Hernandez, a recounting of the plight of a small group of dedicated bodabil artists during the twilight years of their careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"theaterinenglish\" name=\"theaterinenglish\"></a>Filipino Theater in English</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historically, the next and certainly the biggest American influence on Philippine theater was the English language propagated through the educational system established so systematically in 1901. Unlike the Spaniards who had reluctantly and only sporadically taught the Filipinos their language, the Americans established a public school system and teacher-training institutions immediately upon the installation of an insular government. English, it was decided, would be the vehicle of education, and to accomplish this, American teachers were fielded. At first, they were just the soldiers and their wives. Eventually, the Thomasites, a shipload of teachers who came on the USS Thomas in 1901, were sent expressly to teach Filipinos English and, perhaps unbeknownst even to the teachers, the culture loaded in the language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater in English was the immediate result of both the language and the educational system. Considering, however, that these teachers were the fruits of a Victorian education (i.e., not enthusiastic about theater), and had only witnessed, if at all, an American theater in its infancy, the effects of American-style education were not immediately felt in the theater but in the classroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was the change of language, first of all, which inferentially made vernacular theater fit only for the provinces, for the fiestas, and for the unschooled, while English became the language of the schooled and eventually the learned. Certainly the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> and komedya would not be performed or mentioned, much less studied, in schools. And then there were the examples of drama discussed in classrooms: these were textbook plays aimed at teaching the language and serving as practice for the students in speaking English and not linked to the life outside the classroom the way folk plays were so deeply entrenched in community and folk life. Thus, plays staged in classrooms as language exercises came to be many a student&rsquo;s first and lasting impression of theater. Stories like &ldquo;The Monkey&rsquo;s Paw&rdquo; were dramatized, as was Longfellow&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Evangeline.&rdquo; A few playlets, dramatizations, and longer plays like <strong><em>Arms and the Man</em></strong> and <strong><em>Polly with a&nbsp;</em><em>Past</em></strong>, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2919\">Jean Garrot Edades</a>, were staged at the University of the Philippines (UP).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually there came out of the classrooms native playwrights who spoke the new language with some ease and who wrote plays based on the classroom examples. The first play written in English by Filipinos was <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/618\"><strong>A Modern Filipina</strong></a></em></strong>, 1915, by Jesusa Araullo and Lino Castillejo, both from the Philippine Normal College. The play is about a young woman who speaks her mind and plans her future quite independently then decides to accept a suitor who uses an old trick&mdash;he falls out of a tree and plays on her sympathy&mdash;because she has really liked him from the start. With mastery of the language came more playwrights like Jorge Bocobo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\">Carlos P. Romulo</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3280\">Vidal Tan</a>, all of them eventually becoming UP presidents, who progressed from writing occasional plays for Rizal Day, school foundation days, and similar occasions, to commenting on local mores (e.g., marriage, customs, and election promises). While the folk play had been written for fiestas and religious feasts like Holy Week and Christmas, the new plays came to be connected to civic occasions. The best of these plays, such as Vidal Tan&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Husband of Mrs. Cruz</em></strong>, 1929, a comic rendering of elections and their effect on community and family relationships, showed the Filipino&rsquo;s ease with the language and with the one-act play, and his successful adaptation of both Philippine subject matter and life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon came the concept of legitimate theater on legitimate stages, as distinguished from the temporary, open-air, built-for-the-occasion, or built-for-other-purposes stages of folk theater. The legitimate stage was only for drama and to access it, the audience had to purchase tickets to a play that was an event in itself and not part of a community or religious celebration. Legitimate theater required not only a playwright and a director but a support organization for production, publicity, and the box office. Unlike folk theater, there was a clear division between performers and audience, between stage and backstage, and between theater and the life out there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the 1940s and 1950s, when drama had moved out of the classroom and onto school and legitimate stages, and Shakespeare and the Greek tragedies had been performed in public by the Ateneo de Manila and the UP theater groups, playwrights such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a>, and later, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2943\">Alberto Florentino</a>, developed. For them, theater was no classroom exercise but a real and earnest art. Montano, who had studied drama in the United States, still considered it a means of education and established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2746\">Arena Theater</a> at the Philippine Normal School (now a university), fielding plays with teachers-actors, like <strong><em>Parting at Calamba</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/654\"><strong>Sabina</strong></a></em></strong>, 1953, throughout the country to bring modern drama to the schools and communities. Realizing that not many communities could provide real stages, he presented his plays in school auditoriums and classrooms, meeting halls, and open spaces. He also introduced the arena style of production. His most popular play, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/590\"><strong>The Love of Leonor Rivera</strong></a></em></strong>, 1953, which was about the undying love of Leonor Rivera for Jose Rizal, even through marriage to someone else and even beyond death, had continuous productions all over the Philippines from 1953 to 1964. Though the lyricism was in English, the view of the national hero as suffering man and the object of romantic love was most compatible with native sensibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guerrero, who taught at UP, wrote about the emerging middle class who were being educated in English and who were adapting the mores and manners of the Americans they read about and watched in the movies. His most popular plays include <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/687\"><strong><em><strong>Wanted: A Chaperon</strong>e</em></strong></a>, 1940; <strong><em>Forever</em></strong>, 1941; <strong><em>Condemned</em></strong>, 1943; and <strong><em>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/677\"><strong>Three Rats</strong></a></em></strong>, 1948. His <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3336\">UP Mobile Theater</a> took the substance and techniques of his theater around the country, while his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3335\">UP Dramatic Club</a> trained the actors and directors of future productions in and outside of UP. His plays about basketball players, movie actors, parents and children, suitors and chaperones put the Americanized Philippine world on campus and other stages. The plays from Anglo-American repertories that he staged at UP provided theater experience and ideas for audiences of many ages, among them those who later became leaders in the arts as well as in politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Florentino brought to the attention of theater directors and audiences the world outside the English-speaking universe&mdash;i.e., the slums and denizens of Tondo, which were the bases for his plays like <strong><em>Cadaver</em></strong> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/690\"><strong><em>The World Is an Apple</em></strong></a>, both in 1954, and <strong><em>Cavort with Angels</em></strong>, 1959. Clear proof of the English dominance in theater was the fact that Florentino&rsquo;s audiences accepted without question or discomfort the fact that his Tondo stevedores, prostitutes, and slum children spoke correct and idiomatic English. Years later, these plays would be staged in Tagalog translations, and Florentino himself would declare an end to his writing plays in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from plays in English about contemporary Philippines, Montano, Guerrero, and Florentino introduced realism, an element not in the sinakulo and the komedya, and only nascent in the sarsuwela. The Biblical stories, apocryphals like the tales of Samuel Belibet and Boanerhes, the romances of the royalty of Albania and Persia, as well as those of the Estrellas and Angelitas of sarsuwela land and the poets and professionals who love them, were now replaced by stories about a country lass falling in love with a married American, politicians and their empty promises, basketball players and movie stars, love triangles, and the plight of stevedores, prostitutes, and squatters. The real Philippine society was creeping onto the stage and creating a new theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In schools, drama groups without resident playwrights&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2743\">Aquinas Theater Guild</a> at the University of Santo Tomas, the Ateneo de Manila High School&rsquo;s Dramatic Society, which later became <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3159\">Paulinian Players Guild</a> at St. Paul College, the Arellano University Dramatic Club, the Far Eastern University&rsquo;s Drama Department, the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University Experimental Theater, the Manuel L. Quezon Dramatic Club, and the University of the East Dramatic Guild&mdash;staged American and British plays by Shakespeare, James Barrie, George Bernard Shaw, Gilbert and Sullivan, and occasionally European plays in English translation like Edmond Rostand&rsquo;s <strong><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em></strong> and the Greek tragedies. These plays became the lexicon, models, and experience of drama for the Filipino urban youth. For them and for all the theater lovers who watched European classics at Ateneo and modern theater at UP, English was the only language for theater and Anglo-American plays and English translations the only models for world theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, although theater in the 1950s was fairly active, it had no connection or relation to vernacular theater, the chasm between them having been widened by both language and ignorance. The centuries-old theater tradition, which was community-based, often outdoors, and staged in various vernaculars, effectively linking indigenous communities to the Hispanized regional cultures, was effectively wiped out by this new theater that defined legitimate theater as being schooled, enclosed in edifices, and staged in English. This was the time, therefore, of such nonschool groups such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2769\">Barangay Theater Guild</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3077\">Manila Theater Guild</a>, and the Penmouth Playhouse aiming for legitimate theater and suffering from a lack of funds and audiences, which the school groups had, even though in modest numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was through the educational system that the idea of modern theater was sold. Students came to be conversant with Shakespeare and Greek tragedy, with George Bernard Shaw and Longfellow, and later with Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams, without ever having heard of the sarsuwela. The following concepts came as well with these dramas: proscenium stages, box sets, hand props, the fourth wall, later Stanislavsky and the Method, even later the various manifestations of realism and Brecht and other trends and techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This idea of modern theater was reinforced by the movies and later by television shows and videotapes, as well as by materials in print media. The images of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musical theater</a> the schooled and the young had were generally not the sarsuwela and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4384\">Rogelio de la Rosa</a>&ndash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4652\">Carmen Rosales</a> romances but the Broadway musical kind, as typified by <strong><em>Oklahoma</em></strong>, <strong><em>Carousel</em></strong>, and <strong><em>South Pacific</em></strong>, and the Hollywood musical extravaganza, as exemplified by the musicals from Busby Berkeley and the Ziegfeld Follies to <strong><em>Singing in the Rain</em></strong>. From the movies, too, would come models of heavy drama or light comedy, the classics in traditional or new modes, schools of acting and directing, techniques of staging and presentation. Thus, in the contemporary plays, playwrights and directors might refer to and were certainly influenced by the acting of Greta Garbo and Clark Gable, or situations like those in <strong><em>Back Street</em></strong>, <strong><em>Gone&nbsp;</em><em>with the Wind</em></strong>, and&nbsp;<em><strong>Casablanca</strong> </em>. The idea of theater, its form and content, and its social function of educating and entertaining were, for the schooled Filipinos of the first half of the 20th century, according to the American model. Because of the gap between vernacular and English theaters, there was no consciousness of the community base of Philippine theater or of the forms it had taken before the advent of English and the American educational system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Guerrero, Montano, and Florentino, Filipino theater in English continued with the works of Filipino playwrights who wrote original Filipino plays in English. These include Marcelino Agana Jr, who wrote <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/623\"><strong>New Yorker in Tondo</strong></a></em></strong>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5535\">Wilfrido D.

Clemente, <strong><em>The Chieftain&rsquo;s Daughter</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the succeeding years, when more Filipino playwrights were already writing original plays written in Filipino and other Philippine languages, a major factor that ensured the continuance of Filipino plays in English was the Palanca Memorial Awards, which had one-act and full-length English plays in its categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>English-language theater still exists in some schools and most prominently in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines (Rep)</a>, founded in 1967, which has regular seasons featuring current successes on Broadway and the London West End. In effect, it continues the training in English-language theater, this time on a professional level, and its successful proponents, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3235\">Lea Salonga</a>, have gone into careers in theater abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building on Rep&rsquo;s pioneering efforts in professionalizing English-language theater were Rep alumni who founded several theater groups such as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3328\">Triumphant People&rsquo;s Evangelistic Theater Society or Trumpets</a> founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2965\">Audie Gemora</a>, 1990; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2718\">Actor&rsquo;s Actors Inc</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2979\">Bart Guingona</a>, 1992; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3119\">New Voice </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\">Company</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3366\">Monique Wilson</a>, 1994; 9 Works Theatrical by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2976\">Robbie Guevara</a>, 2009; and Red Turnip Theater Company by Ana Abad Santos, Topper Fabregas, Jenny Jamora, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3358\">Cris Villonco</a>, and Rem Zamora, 2013. Other groups focusing on English productions include Atlantis Productions founded by Bobby Garcia, 1999, renamed Atlantis Theatricals Entertainment Group in 2015; and Full House Theater Company, established by the casino Resorts World Manila, 2014, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3363\">Michael Williams</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3041\">Menchu Lauchengco-Yulo</a>, both Rep alumni, as co-artistic directors. These groups continue to stage English-language productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"theaterinlocallanguage\" name=\"theaterinlocallanguage\"></a>Filipino Theater in the Local Language</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bridging the gap, as well as linking the indigenous, Spanish, and American traditions of Philippine theater, became possible in the late 1960s because of the nationalist movement. An awareness of the inordinate impact of the American orientation on Philippine cultural life was a hallmark of this movement. There was a conscious search for Filipino artifacts, culture, identity, and language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In theater, this took the form of research into pre-American theater. Theses and shorter studies explored the komedya, sinakulo, sarsuwela, and other native theater forms. Scholars and librarians undertook the retrieval of texts kept by writers and their families in trunks and under beds and thatched roofs. Theater groups like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2761\">Dulaang Babaylan</a>, PETA, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory Company</a> realized that research was one of their primary tasks, along with revival and revitalization. In lectures and discussions, there was a deliberate effort to synthesize Philippine theater tradition and influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just before the imposition of martial law in 1972, some kind of merging happened among these theater traditions through the activist theater, also called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/478\">street</a> or protest theater. Influences from American, European, Chinese, and native theaters converged with the need to convey urgent messages of protest and change, and resulted in the street plays staged at Plaza Miranda, in front of factories and buildings, and during rallies and demonstrations. Adaptations were made of Clifford Odets&rsquo;s <strong><em>Waiting for Lefty</em></strong>, Lope de Vega&rsquo;s <strong><em>Fuenteovejuna</em></strong>, and the Chinese opera <strong><em>Taking&nbsp;</em><em>Tiger Mountain by Strategy</em></strong>, sometimes in combination with Philippine folk songs and dances. Young playwrights, directors, and actors were calling on everything they knew and remembered of theater in the urgency of their expression. The language was Filipino&mdash;or Tagalog, Cebuano, Ilocano&mdash;but the theater experience reflected in the plays was an amalgam of traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Education at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels was still strongly Anglo-American during these decades. Dramas were read and discussed in English, the choices determined by the availability of American textbooks, and the tastes of teachers trained in America. The pensionado, Fulbright, and other grant programs were not only convenient and helpful, but also seen as highly desirable, necessary for ascent in the academic and cultural ladders. Few went for higher education anywhere but to the United States, and thus the first directors, actors, and theater specialists who pursued careers in Philippine theater knew the American theatrical scene well and held it up as model and ideal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theater groups formed in this intercultural matrix, such as the UP Repertory, PETA, the Ateneo Experimental Theater, Repertory Philippines, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP)</a>, as well as the directors who led them&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2977\">Cecile Guidote</a>, Rolando S. Tinio, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2735\">Zeneida Amador</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3065\">Antonio Mabesa</a>&mdash;were a potent factor in the absorption of foreign theater influences and the formation of contemporary Philippine theater. The directors not only staged plays written by Filipinos but interacted with playwrights, making the plays richer and more stageable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In effect, the educational system and academic scholarships supported the Anglo-American orientation of Philippine theater, and although attention started to be given to the native-born and Hispanic theaters, these did not have the books, scholars, films and videos, touring opportunities, grants for workshops and conferences, and the glamour of Anglo-American theater in the educated Filipino&rsquo;s eyes. Add to this scenario the visiting American theater troupes and lecturers who visited universities and provincial centers, the American directors and actors who gave masteral classes, the books on theater available at the Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center and the British Council, and the American films and videos shown to classes and workshops, and one could understand the ease with which Anglo-American theater entered the Philippine experience and consciousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"realism\" name=\"realism\"></a>Plays of Realism</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realism soon stretched into the other areas it already occupied in Western theater. Psychological realism, which puts emphasis on interior characterization motives, is seen in Tony Perez&rsquo;s explorations of&nbsp;<em>usap-usapan&nbsp;</em>(human interaction) within the family, school, and workplace, among intimates, peers, and superiors, as seen in his <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/519\"><strong>Biyaheng Timog</strong></a></em></strong> (Trip to the South), 1984, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/651\"><strong><em>Sa North Diversion&nbsp;</em><em>Road</em></strong></a> (On the North Diversion Road), 1988; in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3127\">Bienvenido Noriega</a>&rsquo;s inquiry into ideas of home among Filipino expatriates in Europe in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/516\"><strong>Bayan-bayanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Little Country), 1975; in Elsa Martinez-Coscolluela&rsquo;s evocation of individual and familial disintegration in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/564\"><strong><em>In My Father&rsquo;s House</em></strong></a>, 1987; and in Kanakan Balintagos&rsquo;s (also known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4689\">Auraeus Solito</a>) <strong><em>Mga Buhay na Apoy</em></strong> (A Breath of Fire), 2015, which is about a family&rsquo;s struggle to come to terms with its indigenous roots. Perez also wrote a trilogy of plays that touch on middle-class characters dealing with the psychological underpinnings of love and loss: <strong><em>Saan Ba Tayo Ihahatid ng Disyembre?</em></strong> (Where Will December Bring Us?), 2009, staged by PETA, <strong><em>Oktubre, Noong Tayo&rsquo;y Nagmamahalan Pa</em></strong> (October, When We Were Still in Love), 1993, and <strong><em>Nobyembre, Noong Akala Ko&rsquo;y Mahal Kita</em></strong> (November, When I Thought I Love You), 1994, the last two staged by Tanghalang Pilipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on people and their formation, aspirations, and interaction in the context of society, plays of social realism have explored many levels and angles. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5698\">Rogelio Sicat</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/619\"><strong><em>Moses</em></strong>,</a><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/619\"><strong>Moses</strong></a> </em>, 1968, is about the actual practice of &ldquo;justice,&rdquo; with some people being &ldquo;more equal&rdquo; than others; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O.

Plays related to the martial law years and its aftereffects, political activism, and human rights violations such as forced disappearances would still continue to be staged, such as Chris Millado&rsquo;s <strong><em>Desaparecidos</em></strong> (The Disappeared), 1986, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2725\">Reuel Aguila</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/596\"><strong>Maliw</strong></a></em></strong> (Fading), 2009, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3175\">Nick Pichay</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/566\"><strong>Isang Araw sa Karnabal</strong></a></em></strong> (A Day in the Carnival), 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays that comment on ongoing social and cultural concerns have been written. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4510\">Ricky Lee</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>DH: Domestic Helper</em></strong>, 1992, is about domestic helpers; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3079\">Dennis Marasigan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Buhay Ay Pelikula</em></strong> (Life Is a Movie), 1994, touches on the local movie industry; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4839\">Elmer Gatchalian</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ambon ng Kristal</em></strong> (The Crystal&rsquo;s Drizzle), 1994, focuses on teenagers and drug addiction; <strong><em>Tumawag kay Libby Manaoag</em></strong> (Call Libby Manaoag), 1998, is about domestic violence; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2802\">Layeta Bucoy</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/543\"><strong>Ellas Inocentes</strong></a></em></strong>, 2007, deals with incest; and Bucoy&rsquo;s <strong><em>Melanie</em></strong>, 2014, focuses on HIV awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"expressionism\" name=\"expressionism\"></a>Expressionism and Brechtian Styles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The elements of expressionism learned from Brecht&rsquo;s theater of instruction and Augusto Boal&rsquo;s theater of the oppressed suited the martial law strictures against the realistic portrayal of oppression and served well such plays as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mene</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mene Thekel</em></strong> <em><strong>Upharsin</strong> </em>(Your Days Are Numbered), 1981, with its scenes of political prisoners and torture, and such musicals as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/626\"><strong><em>Nukleyar!</em></strong></a> (Nuclear!), 1983, and Dong de los Reyes&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bien Aligtad</em></strong>, 1985, in which music, alongside the dialogue, expresses the feelings generated by the surrounding reality.

In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3265\">Joshua Lim So</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/571\"><strong>Joe Cool: Aplikante</strong></a></em></strong> (Joe Cool: Applicant), 2012, the application process is presented in a rather strange way to demonstrate the struggles of a man to secure a job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contemporary Filipino playwright has obviously learned well from his American texts and teachers, and has successfully synthesized this learning with that from other teachers and with his own Philippine and Asian dramatic heritage. It is not only a predilection for performance that has made this possible. It is also the press of circumstance, the situation of struggle, the onus of oppression, all of which demand a public expression for the community. And theater provides the very best possible venue for such an expression. As theater and film actor-director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4465\">Laurice Guillen</a> told other directors at an international conference, modern theater in the Philippines does not follow trends or evolve styles for artistic reasons alone. Theater is a need and an urgency, not a luxury nor mere entertainment. It is a part of life. It becomes art because of the artists in it, but it is urgency first. And it was this urgency that took the theater in English from the classrooms and legitimate stages back home to the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the theater of modern times, with its American influence, makes use of the concepts, structures, philosophies, and styles of Western theater, it is at its base still a theater born in and serving the community. The community may be a small village or town or, in many cases, it could be a bigger cultural or political community, a region, and even the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since there are very few local schools, degrees, or courses for playwriting and stagecraft, and since local theater groups and institutions like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> offer only workshops and apprenticeships, purposive training for the theater is still obtained mainly in the United States and in England, and occasionally in Europe. Only very recently have there been workshops on how to write a komedya or a sarsuwela for the modern audience, but there are usually courses and workshops on the structure of the tragedy, or the three-act play. Only in recent years has there been contact with Japanese, Chinese, and Indonesian theater, or with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/444\">Brechtian theater</a> in Germany and mime in France. The contemporary theater scene is enriched by a synthesis of all the traditions that have entered and influenced Philippine culture. The indigenous and Hispanic theater is seen not only as revived and revitalized but also as recreated for the modern stage as seen in new sarsuwela like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907), 1982; new komedya like Max Allanigue&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/646\"><strong>Prinsipe Rodante</strong></a></em></strong> (Prince Rodante), 1962; contemporary <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a> and sinakulo; and dance drama like Al Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/136\"><strong>Diablos</strong></a></em></strong> (Demons), 1989, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\">Agnes Locsin</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hinilawod</em></strong> (Tales from the Mouth of the Halawod River), 1992, and Al Santos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala</a>, and Agnes Locsin&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong> (Enchantress), 1992. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/466\">Puppet theater</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/446\">children&rsquo;s theater</a>, mime, masks, and Brecht in translation and adaptation prove the presence as well of various Asian and European theater influences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Productions are now rarely crafted in the vein or structures of komedya and sarsuwela; instead, they use the structures and conventions found in Western forms such as one-act or two-act plays, musicals, or sung-through musicals. However, theater groups occasionally still stage these classic forms with updated staging or adaptations to allow contemporary audiences to relate to the material as in the komedya <strong><em><strong><strong>Florante</strong></strong> at Laura</em></strong> (Florante and Laura), 1994, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3251\">Jonas Sebastian</a> that incorporate modern dances such as cha-cha and boogie and music such as rap, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Gantimpala Theater</a>&rsquo;s annual staging of <strong><em><strong><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></strong></em></strong> as a komedya using choreography sourced from different Philippine areas like San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque; Nabuan, Isabela; and Batanes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tanghalang Pilipino has revived existing sarsuwela such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), 1987; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a></em></strong> (After the Darkness), 1989; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (No Wounds), 1994; and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/650\"><strong>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</strong></a></em></strong> (At the Mercy of Sharks), 1995.

In Quezon City, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a> has staged <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/641\"><strong><em>Papet <strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (The Passion of Jesus Christ in Puppetry), the only children&rsquo;s puppet sinakulo in the country, since 1985.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"theaterartists\" name=\"theaterartists\"></a>Filipino Theater Artists in the United States</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The influence of Anglo-American theater among Filipino artists reaches a sort of ironic reversal when considering the diaspora of Filipinos to the United States. For with this exodus, notably during the martial law years, Filipino theater artists, some of whom had been part of or had been trained by PETA, brought their theater experiences from the Philippines and established Filipino-American theater groups in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ma-Yi Theater Company was formed in New York in 1989, with Chito Jao Garces as its founding artistic director, followed by Ralph Pe&ntilde;a since 1995. While it has staged Ralph Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <strong><em>Flipzoids</em></strong>, which was about the immigration experiences of Filipino-Americans, and Lonnie Carter&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Romance of Magno Rubio</em></strong>, which was based on a short story by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5138\">Carlos Bulosan</a>, the group eventually expanded into an Asian-American theater group in 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In San Francisco, Teatro ng Tanan was established in 1988 by a group of immigrant Filipino theater artists facilitated by Chris Millado. It produced original plays focusing on immigrant experiences and had outreach performances for Filipino World War II veterans. The group was active until 2001. Also in San Francisco, Al Manalo, starting in 1998, reformulated the programming of Bindlestiff Studio, an arts space and theater venue, to nurture and celebrate Filipino-American performing artists and works. Bindlestiff Studio has produced original plays, music festivals, stand-up and sketch comedy shows, dance, visual and video arts created by Filipino-Americans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Chicago, CIRCA Pintig theater group was founded in 1991 initially as the Pintig Cultural Group. Its inaugural production was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1688\"><strong><em><strong>America Is in the Heart</strong></em></strong></a>, based on the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a> by Carlos Bulosan. The Center for Immigrant Resources and Community Arts (CIRCA) became one entity with Pintig in 2006. The new group has staged plays by Filipino and Filipino-American playwrights such as <strong><em>Bells of Balangiga</em></strong>, <strong><em>Nanay Isog and Her Children</em></strong> (Mother Isog and Her Children), <strong><em>Sky Legends</em></strong>, <strong><em>Dreamweavers</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Allos: The Story of Carlos Bulosan</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Los Angeles, San Dionisio sa America was established in the late 1990s by families originally from San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque City, and they brought to the United States an older theater form: sarsuwela productions in Filipino. This group has staged <strong><em>Ang Kambal ng Valencia</em></strong> (The Twins of Valencia), 2002; <strong><em>Hermano de la Paz</em></strong>, 2004; <strong><em>Nerissa at Bolivar</em></strong> (Nerrisa and Bolivar), 2006; and Mike Llamas&rsquo;s <strong><em>Esperanza at Caridad</em></strong> (Esperanza and Caridad), 2008, and <strong><em>Mga Prinsesa ng Cordova</em></strong> (Princesses of Cordova), 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With exposure to American forms and ways of doing theater, Filipino-Americans, whether immigrants or natural-born, are able to adapt and adjust quickly to the US theater industry. Notable Filipino-American theater artists include Jose Llana and Paolo Montalban, both of whom have played lead roles on Broadway; set designers Loy Arcenas and Clint Ramos, both of whom have won awards for their design work off-Broadway; and playwright <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5367\">Jessica Hagedorn</a>, whose plays have been staged in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American influence is still undoubtedly the most strongly felt in Philippine theater, not only in the training of playwrights and theater artists but also in the management of theaters and theater groups, the structure and presentation of plays, and the idea of professional theater. Even when playwrights like Tony Perez, Bienvenido Noriega Jr, Reuel Aguila, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a>, Rody Vera, Nick Pichay, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3193\">Floy Quintos</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3070\">Liza Magtoto</a>, and Layeta Bucoy write plays solidly founded on Philippine experience and ethos, the European and American influence of their education, reading, and play viewing is visible, and this is usually for the good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, there are plays shaped by Philippine social forces, artistic forms, historical perspective, community traditions, and values, such as Paul Dumol&rsquo;s <strong><em>Francisco Maniago</em></strong>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5435\">Domingo Landicho</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/541\"><strong>Dupluhang Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Poetic Joust), 1975; Malou Jacob&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/504\"><strong>Anatomiya ng Korupsyon</strong></a></em></strong> (Anatomy of Corruption), 1992; Layeta Bucoy&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/540\"><strong>Doc Resureccion: Gagamutin ang Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (Doc Resureccion: Will Heal the Nation), 2009, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/685\"><strong>Walang Kukurap</strong></a></em></strong> (Let No One Blink), 2012. But it would be almost impossible to distinguish the native impulse from the shaping, given that the playwright&rsquo;s art is shaped by one&rsquo;s education and American bias.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American influence on Philippine theater, therefore, is found in the tradition that grew out of the educational system, which, with its English language, textbooks, and training, produced certain preferences and orientation; the theater experience acquired through training in the United States and, to a lesser extent, in England, thanks not only to available scholarships but also to the choice and predilection of the trainees; the theater exposure acquired through films, videos, workshops, conferences, libraries, visiting experts, and the mass media; the models created by all these factors; and the continuing consciousness bred by all these, together with the colonial experience. It is an influence that, at worst, reflects the colonial cast of mind, in which the foreign is seen as always superior and preferable to the homegrown. But at best, it is enriching, serving as the avenue for entry into Philippine theater of the tried and the proven, the new, the experimental, the alternative, as well as for experiencing other ways of thinking and discourse, other cultures, and other theaters that, as in the beginning, merge with and/or transform traditional theater. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

The American tradition entered the Philippine stage principally through the educational system established in 1901 and since then has continued, developing with fresh inputs; merging with or transforming traditional theater; siring translations and adaptations; participating in the formation of new playwrights, new trends, new theater; and on the whole, contributing ideas and energy to Philippine theater."

Even if Arthur Riggs, military journalist and eyewitness, did not consider the Filipino stage worthy of the name &#x201C;theater,&#x201D; the native dramatic tradition continued to flourish in the form of the rites and <a href=\"/7/54/432#rituals\">rituals</a>, verse debates, songs and dances of the indigenous theater, as well as folk theater represented by the <a href=\"/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, and the budding <a href=\"/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> and <a href=\"/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>. Each simply found its place on the different stages, whether outdoors or indoors, in barrios, towns, and cities, with its own audience, whether paying or not, during religious feast days, town fiestas, civic occasions, and eventually evenings at the theater. Inevitably, however, the entry of a new culture would have its indelible effect on the Filipino stage."

English, it was decided, would be the vehicle of education, and to accomplish this, American teachers were fielded. At first, they were just the soldiers and their wives. Eventually, the Thomasites, a shipload of teachers who came on the USS Thomas in 1901, were sent expressly to teach Filipinos English and, perhaps unbeknownst even to the teachers, the culture loaded in the language."

And then there were the examples of drama discussed in classrooms: these were textbook plays aimed at teaching the language and serving as practice for the students in speaking English and not linked to the life outside the classroom the way folk plays were so deeply entrenched in community and folk life. Thus, plays staged in classrooms as language exercises came to be many a student&#x2019;s first and lasting impression of theater. Stories like &#x201C;The Monkey&#x2019;s Paw&#x201D; were dramatized, as was Longfellow&#x2019;s poem &#x201C;Evangeline.&#x201D; A few playlets, dramatizations, and longer plays like <strong><em>Arms and the Man</em></strong> and <strong><em>Polly with a&#xA0;</em><em>Past</em></strong>, directed by <a href=\"/7/7/2919\">Jean Garrot Edades</a>, were staged at the University of the Philippines (UP)."

The play is about a young woman who speaks her mind and plans her future quite independently then decides to accept a suitor who uses an old trick&#x2014;he falls out of a tree and plays on her sympathy&#x2014;because she has really liked him from the start.

Romulo</a>, and <a href=\"/7/7/3280\">Vidal Tan</a>, all of them eventually becoming UP presidents, who progressed from writing occasional plays for Rizal Day, school foundation days, and similar occasions, to commenting on local mores (e.g., marriage, customs, and election promises). While the folk play had been written for fiestas and religious feasts like Holy Week and Christmas, the new plays came to be connected to civic occasions. The best of these plays, such as Vidal Tan&#x2019;s <strong><em>The Husband of Mrs. Cruz</em></strong>, 1929, a comic rendering of elections and their effect on community and family relationships, showed the Filipino&#x2019;s ease with the language and with the one-act play, and his successful adaptation of both Philippine subject matter and life."

Legitimate theater required not only a playwright and a director but a support organization for production, publicity, and the box office.

Montano, who had studied drama in the United States, still considered it a means of education and established the <a href=\"/7/7/2746\">Arena Theater</a> at the Philippine Normal School (now a university), fielding plays with teachers-actors, like <strong><em>Parting at Calamba</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/654\"><strong>Sabina</strong></a></em></strong>, 1953, throughout the country to bring modern drama to the schools and communities. Realizing that not many communities could provide real stages, he presented his plays in school auditoriums and classrooms, meeting halls, and open spaces. He also introduced the arena style of production. His most popular play, <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/590\"><strong>The Love of Leonor Rivera</strong></a></em></strong>, 1953, which was about the undying love of Leonor Rivera for Jose Rizal, even through marriage to someone else and even beyond death, had continuous productions all over the Philippines from 1953 to 1964.

From the movies, too, would come models of heavy drama or light comedy, the classics in traditional or new modes, schools of acting and directing, techniques of staging and presentation.

The idea of theater, its form and content, and its social function of educating and entertaining were, for the schooled Filipinos of the first half of the 20th century, according to the American model.

It is not only a predilection for performance that has made this possible. It is also the press of circumstance, the situation of struggle, the onus of oppression, all of which demand a public expression for the community. And theater provides the very best possible venue for such an expression. As theater and film actor-director <a href=\"/4/4/4465\">Laurice Guillen</a> told other directors at an international conference, modern theater in the Philippines does not follow trends or evolve styles for artistic reasons alone. Theater is a need and an urgency, not a luxury nor mere entertainment. It is a part of life. It becomes art because of the artists in it, but it is urgency first. And it was this urgency that took the theater in English from the classrooms and legitimate stages back home to the community."

Only very recently have there been workshops on how to write a komedya or a sarsuwela for the modern audience, but there are usually courses and workshops on the structure of the tragedy, or the three-act play. Only in recent years has there been contact with Japanese, Chinese, and Indonesian theater, or with <a href=\"/7/55/444\">Brechtian theater</a> in Germany and mime in France.

It is an influence that, at worst, reflects the colonial cast of mind, in which the foreign is seen as always superior and preferable to the homegrown. But at best, it is enriching, serving as the avenue for entry into Philippine theater of the tried and the proven, the new, the experimental, the alternative, as well as for experiencing other ways of thinking and discourse, other cultures, and other theaters that, as in the beginning, merge with and/or transform traditional theater. <span class>&#xA0;</span>"

Despite the formal declaration, however, foreign control persisted. From being a colony, the Philippines became a neocolony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippines&rsquo;s status as a neocolony was primarily defined by the economic and military treaties it was forced to forge with the United States (US). The Philippine Trade Act of 1946, also known as the Bell Trade Act, reflected the lopsided tariff agreements in favor of the United States. When the Bell Trade Act was severely criticized by Filipino nationalists, the Laurel-Langley Agreement of 1955 was passed. This new agreement removed some of the provisions that give preferentiality for the former colonizer, but it still guaranteed equal opportunities for US and Filipino business interests in all areas of the Philippine economy (Schirmer and Shalom 1987, 87-88, 95). Moreover, the Military Bases Agreement of 1947 provided the United States with extensive military facilities in many parts of the Philippines for a period of 99 years. Unlike similar agreements for US military bases in other countries, the treaty placed no restrictions on the use of the bases, including the types of weapons that could be stored in these facilities (Ibid., 96-97).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippines became a neocolony of the United States not only politically and economically but ideologically as well. The American educational system continued to function as the most important bearer of American ideology. The public educational system under American colonial rule taught Filipinos to accept the Americans as benefactors, to forget their struggles for freedom, and to help pacify domestic opposition to US policy in the Philippines (Schirmer and Shalom 1987, 45). The curriculum taught Filipinos to trust in its relations with foreigners and to be uncritical about foreign economic control. After the war, the educational system, which remained Western and pro-American, produced a generation of young educated Filipinos who were even more receptive to the American way of life and its accompanying individualistic, competitive, and consumerist attitudes. Much of the success of the educational system in carrying out its function as a strategy of colonization is rooted in the use of English as the medium of instruction and learning. The use of English to teach and to learn &ldquo;became the wedge that separated the Filipinos from their past and later was to separate educated Filipinos from the masses of their countrymen&rdquo; (Constantino 1966, 45).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The educational system implemented in the country was supplemented by educational exchange programs supported by Fulbright, Rockefeller, and Ford. These programs were supposed to provide venues for the exchange of cultural influences. However, the one-way cultural transmission that actually happened only intensified the Americanization of Filipinos, especially of the educated class. Recipients of these programs, mostly artists, writers, and academicians, were given grants to stay in the United States to study, lecture, observe, and immerse themselves in the American culture. Upon their return to the Philippines, they became effective carriers of foreign ideas that spread throughout Philippine academic institutions and other domains of Philippine society (Lumbera 1997, 180). Also important were the visits to the Philippines of American professors and artists who would influence the direction of Philippine arts and culture (Legasto 2008, 76).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developments in radio, television, and film would have a great impact on theater since these forms of mass media were some of the primary channels through which Western culture entered the Philippines. Radio stations aired the latest American pop songs, while television showed canned shows from the United States, including comedies, dramas, horror shows, action dramas, and variety shows. While the film industry tried to come up with original Filipino cinema, it was inundated by well-funded commercial films from Hollywood, including American melodramas, comedies, actions films (cowboy, secret agent, martial arts), and horror thrillers as well as European soft-core sex films and Italian cowboy movies. In order to compete with these imported films, some local movies produced local versions of these foreign genres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The political, economic, educational, and cultural opportunities benefited only a small sector of Philippine society. As a result, the economic gap between the rich and the poor widened. Toward the mid-1960s, the living conditions of the great majority of Filipinos were getting worse. The US influence on Philippine politics and economy continued, its military privileges protected and strengthened. Opposition against the government and the status quo grew louder and stronger. Because of worsening poverty, workers in the urban areas and peasants in the regions became more radical. In various schools and universities, militant student movement emerged. Mass rallies and demonstrations were met with violence. The so-called First Quarter Storm took place, marked by the following historic events: the Battle of Mendiola in Jan 1970; the people&rsquo;s congresses at Plaza Miranda, Congress, and the US Embassy, Feb-Mar 1971; and the Diliman Commune and University of the Philippines (UP) Barricades in Feb 1971 (Legasto 2004, 172-73). These changing conditions were reflected in the changes that happened in Philippine theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"theatergroups\" name=\"theatergroups\"></a>Theater Groups</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>School-Based Theater Groups</strong>. One of the main channels through which American ideology and way of life continued to be passed on to generations of young Filipino was the staging of foreign plays in English. Plays written by American or European playwrights that have so-called &ldquo;artistic merits&rdquo; based on Western standards dominated the theater scene after World War II. The school setting remained to be the center of legitimate theater productions in English. After the war, other school-based theater groups followed the lead of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2754\">Ateneo Players Guild</a> established in 1921: the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3336\">UP Dramatic Club</a>, 1930, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2932\">Far Eastern University (FEU) Theater Guild</a>, 1934. Some of the theater figures who established theater groups after the war were part of these earlier groups. For example, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3142\">Onofre Pagsanghan</a>, who established <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a> was part of the Ateneo Players&rsquo; Guild, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a>, who organized the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2746\">Arena Theater</a>, was a member of the UP Dramatic Club. Just like their predecessors, most of the postwar theater groups mounted original foreign plays in English or English translations of foreign plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3159\">Paulinian Players Guild</a> was founded in the early 1950s at the St. Paul College in Manila. Some of the plays it mounted were Edmond Rostand&rsquo;s <strong><em>L&rsquo;Aiglon</em></strong>, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Sound of Music</em></strong> and <strong><em>Carousel</em></strong>, and Alan Jay Lerner&rsquo;s <strong><em>Brigadoon</em></strong>. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2743\">Aquinas Dramatic Guild</a> also started in the early 1950s at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) and was an offshoot of a series of radio plays in 1952. It was initially called the Aquinas Radio Dramatic Guild, which later became the Aquinas Dramatic Guild when it staged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4084\">Antonio Molina</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>His Eminence</em></strong>, an English translation of Jose Maria Peman&rsquo;s <strong><em>El Gran Cardenal</em></strong>. The group founded by Onofre Pagsanghan at the Ateneo de Manila High School was first organized in 1956 as the Ateneo de Manila High School&rsquo;s Dramatic Society. In 1966, it became the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a>. The earlier group regularly produced Shakespearean plays such as <strong><em>Macbeth</em></strong> and <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong>, and even Rostand&rsquo;s <strong><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em></strong>. Other school-based theater groups that mounted similar repertoire included the Arellano University Dramatic Club, FEU&rsquo;s Drama Department, the Philippine Women&rsquo;s University Experimental Theater, the Manuel L. Quezon Dramatic Club, and the University of the East Dramatic Guild.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from these theater groups, school-based organizations such as fraternities and sororities, as well as student religious groups, would often stage plays in English to celebrate important occasions, to raise funds for the organization, or to use theater to project an image for the organization. In UP, fraternities and sororities that ventured into theater production were the Tau Alpha, Upsilon Sigma Phi, Sigma Rho, Aztecs Confraternity, Phi Kappa Mu, Upsilon Sigma Phi, Alpha Phi Omega, Beta Sigma, Alpha Phi Beta, Sigma Alpha Sorority, Delta Lambda Sigma Sorority, Sigma Delta Phi Sorority, Sigma Beta Sorority, Phi Delta Alpha Sorority, Kappa Phi Omega Sorority, and Sigma Delta Phi. The University of the Philippines Student Catholic Action established Dramatic Guild, which later became Dulaang Delaney, and the University of the Philippines Christian Youth Movement (UPCYM) organized the UPCYM Playhouse to mount plays in English by foreign and Filipino playwrights (Carbayas 1999, 64-73).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in the regions, school-based theater groups that were established after World War II produced mostly Western plays. El Teatro, which was founded in 1959, and The Genesius, established in 1965, both based at the University of St. La Salle in Bacolod, mounted foreign plays and musicals. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3183\">Portal Players</a>, founded in 1966 as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University (SU)</a> theater group, mounted Western classics, continuing the tradition of the earlier group, the Department of Language and Dramatic Arts of SU, established in 1961. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3340\">USA Little Theater</a>, organized in 1965 at the University of San Agustin in Iloilo, also presented mostly Western materials, and later, works by Filipino playwrights in English such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were school-based theater groups that stood out during the period since they focused not on foreign plays in English but developed original Filipino plays in English. Their productions may be considered important transitions from legitimate theater in English toward the development of an original Filipino theater. The Arena Theater of the Philippines was founded by Severino Montano in 1953 at the Philippine Normal College (or PNC, now Philippine Normal University). The Arena Theater of the Philippines did not limit its performances within the PNC community. It fielded teacher-actors throughout the country to bring modern drama to other schools and communities. Montano also introduced the arena style of production that enabled the group to perform in various towns and barrios all over the Philippines. The group developed 4 full-length plays and 18 one-act plays in English mostly written by Montano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3336\">UP Mobile Theater</a> was established in 1962 by Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero in UP. The group performed plays by Guerrero, which while mostly written in the 1930s and 1940s, became even more popular after the war. Among these were <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/687\"><strong><em><strong>Wanted: A Chaperon</strong>e</em></strong></a>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/553\"><strong>Half an Hour in a Convent</strong></a></em></strong>, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/677\"><strong>Three Rats</strong></a></em></strong>. The group also aimed at bringing theater to different regions of the country. Meanwhile, another theater organization, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2836\">Chamber Theater Group</a>, was organized in FEU in 1964 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2724\">Nick Agudo</a>. The group developed plays based on literary works by Filipino authors in English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the plays of Montano and Guerrero were staged in many communities in various regions in the Philippines and dealt with Philippine realities, a number of their plays were eventually translated or adapted to other Philippine languages. These translations and adaptations prompted the entry of the national language and other major Philippine languages into the domain of legitimate theater. Onofre Pagsanghan would transform the Ateneo Dramatics Society, which regularly produced Shakespearean plays, into Dulaang Sibol, which adapted foreign plays. While the productions still worked within the framework of the foreign plays, they nevertheless consciously explored the use of the Filipino language in legitimate theater in the case of the translations, and adjusted the foreign materials to bring them closer to the Filipino audience in the case of the adaptations. In 1967, Dulaang Sibol would initiate the Paligsahang Pandulaan. This playwriting competition encouraged the Ateneo High School students to write and direct original Filipino plays. It produced theater luminaries such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Non-School-Based Theater Groups</strong>. Aside from the school-based theater groups, there were other groups whose members came from various professions and persuasions, and catered to different communities and sectors of society. Initially, these non-school-based theater groups offered almost the same repertoire of English plays by foreign playwrights or written by Filipinos. During the period of the First Quarter Storm, however, groups that were linked with the nationalist movement emerged and developed plays that were collectively called political, activist, or revolutionary theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2769\">Barangay Theater Guild</a>, founded in 1939 by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4282\">Lamberto</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2991\">Daisy Avellana</a>, continued to present classic and modern English plays. Other non-school-based theater groups were the Community Players, Tambuli Playhouse, and Penmouth Playhouse. There was also the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3077\">Manila Theater Guild</a> established in 1951, which was based at the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/265\">Army-Navy Club</a> in Manila. Its members were Filipinos, but its directors and actors often came from the American and British communities in Manila. The group had an average of six productions a year of Spanish, British, and American plays, presented mostly to the foreign community in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1967, even when there was a movement toward the Filipinization of theater as a response to the call of the times, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines (Rep)</a> was established by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2735\">Zeneida Amador</a>. It aimed to make theater a social habit for Filipinos by presenting regular theater seasons with foreign plays, mostly from Broadway and London&rsquo;s West End. Its productions were patronized primarily by the elite sector of the society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mid-1960s, several theater groups were formed which faced the challenges of the times by creating original Filipino plays. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> was founded in 1967 by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2977\">Cecile Guidote</a> to concretize her &ldquo;Prospectus for the National Theater of the Philippines.&rdquo; Initially, its policy was to present plays depicting Filipino culture, as well as Filipino translations of foreign plays. The group later developed the concept of &ldquo;aesthetics of poverty,&rdquo; and later on, its writers&rsquo; pool created committed plays&mdash;those that deal with the examination of relevant sociopolitical issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another group that focused on raising the social consciousness of the Filipino audience through original Filipino theater was the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\">Company</a>, founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a> in 1968. Most of its significant productions in Filipino would be staged after the declaration of martial law. The group would also develop a theater form, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/481\"><strong>tula-dula</strong></a> (poem-play) which is appropriate to the limitations as well as to the purpose of mounting plays in the streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the regions, there was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3025\">Kolambugan Dance Theater</a>, founded in Lanao in 1970. It sought to unite Muslims and Christians through theater. All of its productions were dance dramas written and conceptualized by the group&rsquo;s founder, Fr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2953\">Rodulfo Galenzoga</a>. Its most successful play is <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/600\"><strong>Maranatha</strong></a></em></strong> (Make Haste, Lord), which toured all over the country and performed 135 times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the First Quarter Storm, theater groups that were linked with the broader nationalist movement were formed. From the productions of these theater groups, activist theater emerged. Militant student groups, such as Kabataang Makabayan and Samahan ng Demokratikong Kabataan (SDK), organized cultural groups that used theater as a political tool. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>, the cultural arm of the Katipunan ng mga Kabataang Demokratiko, sought to promote a national, mass, and scientific culture through plays like <strong><em>Kalbaryo ni Juan de la Cruz</em></strong> (The Calvary of Juan de la Cruz), <strong><em>Hukumang Bayan</em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Court), <strong><em>Rebolusyon</em></strong> (Revolution), and <strong><em>Kamatayan ng Isang Aktibista</em></strong> (Death of an Activist), staged between 1969 and 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The establishment of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a> ca. 1970 was initiated by the SDK. Under the leadership of Behn Cervantes, its artistic director, the productions of the group were political in orientation. It staged <strong><em>Alay kay <strong>Ka Amado</strong></em></strong> (In Honor of Ka Amado), 1971, and <strong><em>Barikada</em></strong> (Barricades), 1971. The group&rsquo;s plays often employed a <strong>koro</strong> (chorus) since there were no microphones as they performed not only in schools and urban poor communities but also during rallies. The group also held discussions with the audience regarding the issues presented in the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3150https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3150\">Panday-Sining</a> was founded by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a> in 1971. Its theater repertoire includes agitprop skits, mobile <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/478\">street theater</a>, choreographed music and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, vignettes, and one-act plays. Some of its most known plays are <strong><em>Masaker sa Araw ng Paggawa</em></strong> (Labor Day Massacre), 1970; <strong><em>Hukumang Tuwad</em></strong> (Kangaroo Court), 1971; <strong><em><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>Welga! Welga!</strong></a></strong></strong></em></strong> (Strike! Strike!), 1972; and <strong><em>Sinipi sa Buhay</em></strong> (Drawn from Life). Its artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3212\">Leo Rimando</a> employed various theater forms and styles such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\">realism</a>, expressionism, and absurdism, and drew inspiration from the proletarian Chinese Theater of Jiang Jing and from Bertolt Brecht.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The productions of these politically motivated theater groups represent a break from the plays produced in the 1940s up to the first half of 1960s. Theater was treated not only as a pedagogical tool for language teaching and as a form of entertainment but also as a means of raising social awareness and motivating people to transform society.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"education\" name=\"education\"></a>Education and Training</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the first decades of American colonial rule, theater was primarily used to reinforce the teaching of English through dialogues, skits, and short plays. As a result, the classroom became the default venue for theater activities, with the English teachers serving as &ldquo;trainers.&rdquo; After the war, theater moved out of the classrooms and into school stages and performed to larger audiences. More schools instituted drama subjects and established drama clubs or theater groups. English teachers and professors were usually assigned to teach drama, advise drama clubs, and direct plays on special occasions such as foundation days, national holidays, and feast days, thus continuing the dominance of the English language in theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, theater began to be seen not just as a complementary activity to the teaching of the English language but already as an art and a discipline in itself. Universities developed more drama subjects that later on became the foundation for a complete academic program in theater. Usually, the theater arts department emerged from the English department of colleges and universities. In 1959, the UP Department of Speech and Drama (DSD) was founded. By the 1960s, DSD included elementary stagecraft, playwriting, acting, and art history of the theater in its roster of courses. Eventually, when DSD became the Department of Speech Communication and Theater Arts in 1977, these courses were finally recognized as independent of theater courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, in 1965, the Department of Language and Dramatic Arts of Silliman University was established, which later gave birth to a separate Department of Speech and Drama in 1967. The latter offered majors and minors in English, and speech and drama. The Department focused on training students on the various aspects of theater production, instituting new subjects like acting, directing, and design. In 1969, it was renamed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3261\">Speech and Theater Arts Department</a>, which offered a bachelor of arts degree in speech and theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater education and training were also obtained from the theater groups through actual productions, workshops, and apprenticeship. Training was principally conducted by theater directors who were also the groups&rsquo; founders and artistic leaders. The first group of influential theater directors were Americans or American-educated artists. Before and immediately after the war, Fr <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3005\">Henry Lee Irwin</a>, SJ, was active in Ateneo de Manila, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2919\">Jean Garrott Edades</a> was in UP. In the postwar era up to the 1970s, Severino Montano directed for the Arena Theater of the Philippine Normal University; Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero for the UP Dramatics Club and UP Mobile Theater; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3207\">Fr James Reuter SJ</a> for the Paulinian Players of St. Paul College; Lamberto V. Avellana and Daisy Hontiveros-Avellana for the Barangay Theater Guild; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3013\">Sarah Joaquin</a>, Nick Agudo, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2820\">Rustica Carpio</a> for the FEU Theater Guild; Onofre Pagsanghan for the Ateneo Dramatics Guild and Dulaang Sibol; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2944\">Frank Flores</a> for Portal Players; Zeneida Amador for Repertory Philippines; Cecile Guidote for PETA; Behn Cervantes for the UP Repertory Company; and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando S.Tinio</a> for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The training provided by some of these directors was not confined within the groups they established and the school communities they served. Various schools and communities all over the Philippines benefited from the performances and training programs by groups such as Montano&rsquo;s Arena Theater of the Philippines and Guerrero&rsquo;s UP Mobile Theater, which also conducted training-workshops to increase the number of theater directors, playwrights, actors, production staff, and even theater groups. Six years after Arena Theater was founded in 1953, the group expanded into 45 independent branches mostly in Pangasinan, Negros Occidental, and Cebu. The University of San Agustin&rsquo;s USA Little Theater, formally established in 1965, traced its beginnings from a seminar Guerrero conducted among theater enthusiasts in the USA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of these directors and artistic leaders introduced Western theatrical traditions, aesthetics, and practices, while also adapting them to local contexts. The history of Chamber Theater Group represents one concrete example by which foreign theater aesthetics and practices were transported to and popularized in the Philippines. The group was formed in 1964 after theater artist Nick Agudo completed his observation and work at Northwestern University with Robert Breen who developed the concept of chamber theater&mdash;a theater form where a literary work is adapted to the stage using a maximal amount of the work&rsquo;s original text. Agudo experimented with short stories in his classroom laboratory productions. From his first batch of students in oral interpretation, the Chamber Theater Group was organized. In 1966, the American Embassy invited the group to popularize chamber theater in the Visayas and Mindanao using Filipino short stories as material. It also performed for public schools in Manila, and later the organization of public schools held an annual contest of chamber theater productions using the scripts developed by the Chamber Theater Group. While the experience of the Chamber Theater Group simulated the flow of foreign influences from its origin and into many parts of the Philippines, the group should also be credited for utilizing the works of Filipino authors for its theater productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Activist theater during the First Quarter Storm demanded a change in the training of all those involved in the production of plays. There was emphasis on politicization. Artists and staff members were expected to have knowledge of the various aspects of production but equally important was their knowledge of the prevailing political and social issues and realities. Lectures and discussions were conducted to equip theater artists and practitioners with the correct political and aesthetic orientation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were also changes in the practices of producing plays. Plays were written individually, but more often, collectively. The spirit of democratization was carried out even in the process of conceptualizing and deciding on the final form of the play through collective decision making by the director, playwright, performers, and production people. The collective spirit was extended even to the audience. Primarily, plays were written in the national language and other Philippine languages. Also, the barriers set down between the performers and the audience by the proscenium stage were dismantled. This was done by employing staging techniques that allowed performers to come from or move around the audience&rsquo;s area or by using theater styles that required the audience not only to view the performance but also to actively participate in its completion. In a way, theater artists and audiences were being educated and trained on a new kind of theater that is democratic and participatory.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"venues\" name=\"venues\"></a>Venues and Spaces</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since schools and universities became the center of theater activities after World War II, most of the theater productions were mounted on large classrooms, dining halls, dormitories, assembly halls, school auditoriums, gymnasiums, and other spaces within the campuses. As many of these spaces were not really meant for staging plays, members of theater groups mustered their creativity and resourcefulness to improvise theater equipment and other staging requirements. The impressive productions of some school-based groups and the vision of school administrators to make their institution the center of theater and cultural activities in their community, city, or region eventually led to greater support from the school administration, particularly for the construction of theater venues. The FEU Auditorium was completed in 1949 primarily for the theater productions of the FEU Drama Guild. Because the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> and other performing venues in Manila were damaged by the war, the 1,020-seater FEU Auditorium became the best venue for the performing arts in Manila. The auditorium is known for its centralized air-conditioning system and revolving stage, which were uncommon features in theaters during that time. The long theater tradition at St. Paul College of Manila along Herran St (now Pedro Gil), led to the construction of the Fleur-de-Lis Auditorium, which was formally inaugurated in 1957. Because of the productions of such teacher-directors as Fr James Reuter and Daisy Avellana, the Fleur-de-Lis came to be known as &ldquo;the Broadway of Herran&rdquo; (Dalisay 2007). These newly constructed auditoriums ensured steadier and sustained theater productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was also the Pavillion of the Army Navy Club reserved for the productions of the Manila Theater Guild. Auditoriums of foreign cultural centers like Thomas Jefferson Cultural Center, Goethe Institut, the British Council, and the Centro Cultural de Espa&ntilde;a, and the various open-air stages like the Luneta, Paco Park, and Puerta Real also became performance venues. In 1969, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> was built. It houses three theaters with different seating capacities: Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a> (formerly Main Theater), seats 1,800, built for major theater productions, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">operas</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/798\">symphony</a> concerts; Tanghalang <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a> (formerly Little Theater), seats 420, meant for more intimate plays; and Tanghalang <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Huseng Batute</a> (formerly Bulwagang Gantimpala), seats 240, suited for more experimental and minimalist theater forms and types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite these theater venues and spaces, there was still a lack of performance sites to accommodate the various large and small-scale productions of different theater groups. The shortage of theater structures, especially in the regions, challenged the imagination of theater artists to explore more novel spaces and develop new theater forms and types to adapt to the limited facilities and resources, as well as to the aims of their performances. Montano&rsquo;s Arena Theater, for example, used the theater-in-the-round concept, wherein the audience surrounds the performance area. When the group brought its productions to various towns and barrios all over the Philippines, it explored arenas such as rice and cane fields, plazas, markets, cockpits, and other open spaces to mount its plays. A few years after, Guerrero would also develop his version of <strong>teatro rodante</strong> or <strong>portable theater</strong> through his UP Mobile Theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many activist theater groups mounted their plays in various open spaces&mdash;streets, factories, plazas, basketball courts, school lobbies, facades of government buildings, marketplaces, tops of trucks, and strike areas. Since the plays were mounted wherever and whenever, there was a need for such performance to use minimal props and inexpensive and improvised sets and costumes. Theater groups used choruses to project their dialogues or to represent certain objects or images. The use of the streets and other open spaces as theater venues was not so much because of the absence of a performance space but to bring the issues and the message immediately to a wider audience and to veer away from the exclusivity that characterized much of theater after the war until the mid-1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"scholarship\" name=\"scholarship\"></a>Scholarship</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scholarship produced during this period dealt with Philippine theater history, forms, and artists. Expectedly, colleges and universities with academic programs in literature, languages, humanities, and the arts produced a number of scholarly works on theater in the form of theses which served as final requirements to obtain graduate degrees. These research outputs included Ester Francisco Deniga&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ang mga Kuwento at Dula ni <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3210\">Severino Reyes</a> sa Larangan ng Panitikang Pilipino&rdquo; (Stories and Plays of Severino Reyes in the Field of Philippine Literature), 1948; Federico B.

Research outputs, published works, and the collections of a number of significant plays especially of the prewar American period provided a useful typology and identification of important characteristics of the various theater forms and types, gave some annotations on texts and performances, and introduced works, artists, organizations, institutions, and structures of a number of theater traditions in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seen in the light of the theater productions during this period which focused on foreign plays in English, these research outputs that collectively represent a search for Filipino roots may be taken as a counter-discourse. The scholars&rsquo; emphasis on researching the beginnings of Filipino theater may be attributed to influential academic figures such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5788\">Leopoldo Yabes</a>, who encouraged graduate students to look for the foundations of Filipino culture. Some theater critics, however, noted the weak points of the majority of theater scholarship produced during the period. The approach was textual and formalist, and the critical framework was still Western, which at times resulted in an unenthusiastic reading of the plays written by Filipinos (Chua 2012, 92-97; Melendrez-Cruz 1994, 5-6). Despite these limitations, these research outputs and publications provided the groundwork for a more nationalist theater scholarship, in both subject matter and critical framework, starting in the 1970s and up to the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"theater\" name=\"theater\"></a>Theater Forms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater forms that prevailed during the period from 1946 to 1972 were (1) the traditional theater forms such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>; (2) the foreign plays in English such as the Greek classics, Shakespearean plays, and modern plays; (3) translations and adaptations of foreign plays; and (4) original Filipino plays in English and in Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the period was dominated by foreign plays in English that included the Greek classics, Shakespearean plays, and modern American and European plays. They were primarily performed in schools, universities, and other &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; or formal theaters. Soon, Filipino playwrights and directors began translating and adapting foreign plays in English into Filipino and other Philippine languages to make them more accessible and meaningful to the Filipino audience. Theater artists pushed forward by creating original Filipino plays in English, and eventually in Filipino, that focused on the personal and collective experiences and realities of the Filipino people. These original Filipino plays used forms and styles of both realist and nonrealist theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Traditional Theater Forms</strong>. Theater forms that started and developed during the Spanish period and the first decades of the American period, such as komedya, sinakulo, sarsuwela, and bodabil, survived even after World War II. They were still performed by theater groups, mostly in the provinces, in areas where community support continued and where people saw the performance of such traditional forms as a duty and a devotion. In many places, however, these forms disappeared. Industrialization turned farmers into workers who could no longer participate in the staging, the elite discontinued its support, education taught younger generations to look down on these traditions, and mass media lured the audience into its fold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Significant were the first attempts to modify the form and alter the content of the komedya to make it more relevant to contemporary audiences. One of the first attempts to modernize the komedya was <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/646\"><strong><em>Principe Rodante</em></strong></a> (Prince Rodante), written by lawyer Maximino Allanigue Jr. The play still presented the conflict between the Christians and Moors. But as in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Florante</strong></strong> at Laura</em></strong></a> (Florante and Laura), it blurred the character stereotypes based on race and religion of the traditional komedya. It was first staged by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3028\">Komedya ng San Dionisio in Para&ntilde;aque</a> in May 1962 under the direction of Dr Felicidad Mendoza. Later Dr Mendoza established the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3029\">Kudyapi Community Theater League</a>, which staged her own komedya scripts, like <strong><em>Prinsesa Perlita</em></strong> (Princess Perlita), an adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>&rsquo;s classic poem &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1938\">Sa Dakong Silangan</a>&rdquo; (Toward the East). The group had a children&rsquo;s arm, the Kudyapi Dulaang Munti ng Comedia, which staged <strong><em>Prinsesa Manok at Prinsipe Lawin</em></strong> (Princess Chicken and Prince Hawk) and <strong><em>Sa Paningin ng Puso ng mga Haring Mago</em></strong> (A View from the Heart of the King Magi).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional sinakulo, a play that dramatizes the history of salvation, from the creation of the world to the passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, mounted during Lenten season, especially during the Holy Week, continued in the provinces of Rizal, Bulacan, Pampanga, Bataan, Laguna, Pangasinan, Camarines Sur and other Bicol provinces, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, and Leyte (Tiongson 1999c, 4). However, in many other areas, starting in the 1950s, with the gradual decline of the rural economy as a result of urbanization and industrialization, the traditional sinukulo began to decline. In some urban areas, it survived because of the introduction of modern techniques of staging without changing its traditional message (Tiongson 1999c, 3). For example, in Kapitangan, Paombong, Bulacan, the full seven-night sinakulo in the 1950s was shortened. When the play was reworked in 1972, only selected scenes were staged&mdash;from the agony in the garden to the crucifixion&mdash;from 10:00 am to 12:00 noon on Good Friday (Tiongson as cited in Modelo 1984, 1-2). In some provinces, an element of sensationalism was added, such as the actual crucifixion of penitents in Cutud, San Pedro, San Fernando, Pampanga, since 1963 (Tiongson 1999c, 21). This attracted more local and foreign audiences to watch the play. Since the 1970s, politicized theater artists developed a new type of sinakulo. They appropriated the narrative of Christ, removing its conservative values and fusing it with sectoral concerns or by drawing parallelisms between the life and sufferings of Christ and the majority of the Filipino people (Tiongson 1999c, 3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were still playwrights who created original sarsuwela during this period. One was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3063\">Iluminado Lucente</a>, a well-known <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a> poet and playwright, who wrote about 30 plays, most of which were sarsuwela or melodramas interspersed with songs. These included <strong><em>Abugho</em></strong> (Jealousy), 1949; <strong><em>Mga Retrato han Akon Bungto</em></strong> (Pictures of My Hometown) and <strong><em>Usa nga Pinit han&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Aton Kinabuhi</em></strong> (A Slice of Life), 1952. Another playwright from the region who wrote Pampango sarsuwela even after the war was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2954\">Jose Gallardo</a>. His best-known play, <strong><em>Crucifijong Pilak</em></strong> (Silver Crucifix), a three-act sarsuwela first staged in 1956, had almost a hundred performances. In Davao, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2961\">Karl Gaspar</a> wrote a sarsuwela in 1971 titled <strong><em>Ang Ngot-ngot nga&nbsp;</em><em>Kangit-ngit</em></strong> (The Pain of Darkness). In 1971, PETA staged <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/555\"><strong>Halimaw</strong></a></em></strong> (Monster), libretto by Isagani Cruz, music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a> Jr, and direction by Felix Padilla Jr, which is considered to be the first modern sarsuwela. Here, elements of folk literature are fused with various theater forms and styles, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/444\">Brechtian theater</a>, theater of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/440\">absurd</a>, Broadway musical comedy, and Chinese revolutionary theater, to dramatize metaphorically the state of affairs in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bodabil or stage show experienced a period of popularity after the war. Several troupes produced bodabil shows at the Clover Theater and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a>, among others. Famous was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a> who assembled several bodabil troupes and discovered new bodabil talents such as comedians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4333\">Chiquito</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4307\">Cachupoy</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4912\">German Moreno</a>, and singers <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\">Pepe Pimentel</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\">Diomedes Maturan</a>, and Eddie Peregrina. Famous singers such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4546\">Eddie Mesa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4875\">Sylvia La Torre</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4936\">Elizabeth Ramsey</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\">Pilita Corrales</a> also appeared in stage shows. However, by the late 1960s, the stage show had to compete not only with movies but also with television. To keep up with the competition, the stage show presented burlesque shows, but even these were no match to the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1061\">bomba</a>&nbsp;</em>films which rose in the 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Foreign Plays in English</strong>. Foreign plays in English that were mounted during this period were Greek classics, Shakespearean plays, and modern American and European plays. These plays primarily entered the Philippine stage through the educational system and, later, through professional and semiprofessional theater initiatives. Foreign professors and theater practitioners who settled in the Philippines, as well as Filipino theater practitioners who studied abroad, were instrumental in popularizing these plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Greek classics and other Western classics that were performed were Sophocles&rsquo;s <strong><em>Oedipus Rex</em></strong>, Moliere&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Imaginary Invalid</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Physician in Spite of Himself</em></strong>, Henrik Ibsen&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ghosts</em></strong>, Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em></strong>, Anton Chekhov&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Boor</em></strong>, Luigi Pirandello&rsquo;s <strong><em>Six Characters in Search of an Author</em></strong>, and Edmond Rostand&rsquo;s <strong><em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em></strong> and <strong><em>L&rsquo;Aiglon</em></strong>. Many theater groups mounted plays by William Shakespeare such as <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong>, <strong><em>Macbeth</em></strong>, <strong><em>The&nbsp;</em><em>Merchant of Venice</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Julius Caesar</em></strong>. Among the modern American plays that were produced by Filipino theater groups were Daniel Lord&rsquo;s <strong><em>Everyman</em></strong>, Louisa May Alcott&rsquo;s <strong><em>Little Women</em></strong>, Eugene O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>Mourning Becomes Electra</strong> </em>and <strong><em>Long Day&rsquo;s Journey into Night</em></strong>, T.S. Eliot&rsquo;s <strong><em>Murder in&nbsp;</em><em>the Cathedral</em></strong>, Maxwell Anderson&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Bad Seed</em></strong>, Ali Samson Raphaelson&rsquo;s <strong><em>Accent on Youth</em></strong>, Thornton Wilder&rsquo;s <strong><em>Our Town</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Happy Journey to the Treton and Camden</em></strong>, Arthur Miller&rsquo;s <strong><em>All My Sons</em></strong>, Tennessee Williams&rsquo;s <strong><em>Suddenly Last Summer</em></strong> and <strong><em>Something Unspoken</em></strong>, George Axelrod&rsquo;s <strong><em>Seven Year Itch</em></strong>, Sydney Kingsley&rsquo;s <strong><em>Darkness at Noon</em></strong>, and Oscar Hammerstein II and Joshua Logan&rsquo;s <strong><em>South Pacific</em></strong>. Some of the modern European plays that were mounted on Philippine stage were Maurice Baring&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Drawback</em></strong>, Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mother Courage and Her Children</em></strong>, Federico Lorca&rsquo;s <strong><em>The House of Bernarda Alba</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Blood Wedding</em></strong>, Eugene Ionesco&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Bald Soprano</em></strong>, Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s <strong><em>Waiting for Godot</em></strong>, and Joaquin Calvo Sotelo&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Wall</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Translations and Adaptations</strong>. Rolando Tinio introduced major works of Western theater to a wider Filipino audience with his translations such as <strong><em>Laruang Kristal</em></strong>, 1966, a translation of Tennessee Williams&rsquo; <strong><em>The Glass Menagerie</em></strong>; <strong><em>Pahimakas sa Isang Ahente</em></strong>, 1966, a translation of Arthur Miller&rsquo;s <strong><em>Death of a Salesman</em></strong>; <strong><em>Paghihintay kay Godot</em></strong>, 1967, a translation of Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s <strong><em>Waiting for Godot</em></strong>; and <strong><em>Miss Julie</em></strong>, 1967, a translation of August Strindberg&rsquo;s work with the same title. Brecht&rsquo;s plays were presented in their English translations such as <strong><em>Mother Courage and Her Children</em></strong>, 1968, by Repertory Philippines, and <strong><em>The Good Woman of Setzuan</em></strong>, 1970, and in Filipino, 1971, by PETA. Eugene Ionesco&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Bald Soprano</em></strong>, staged in the early 1960s by the UP Dramatic Club, was adapted and performed by PETA as <strong><em>Ang Tatay Mong Kalbo</em></strong> in 1967.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the foreign plays were not only translated but adapted to bring them closer to the Filipino audience. Onofre Pagsanghan would transform the Ateneo Dramatics Society, which regularly produced Shakespearean plays, into Dulaang Sibol which adapted foreign plays. It produced <strong><em>Wala sa Ating mga Bituin</em></strong> (Not in Our Stars), 1966, an adaptation of J.M. Barrie&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dear Brutus</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Doon Po sa Amin</em></strong>, 1968, Pagsanghan&rsquo;s local adaptation of Thornton Wilder&rsquo;s <strong><em>Our Town</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some foreign plays were even translated into other Philippine languages. For example, when Reuter established Cathedral Players in 1949 based in Ateneo de Naga, he produced Western plays and also translated and adapted English plays into Bikol such as <strong><em>Everyman</em></strong>, <strong><em>Do Not Lie</em></strong>, <strong><em>Wherever David Goes</em></strong>, <strong><em>All Brides Are Beautiful</em></strong>, and&nbsp;<em><strong>Petty Juan</strong> </em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Original Filipino Plays in English</strong>. After World War II, directors and playwrights who were products of the American educational system and educational exchange programs produced original plays in English. Their plays may be considered the results of their education in language or literature, their studies in the graduate programs in creative writing in the United States, the workshops and conferences they participated in abroad, and the theater experience they acquired from the theater groups they engaged with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original Filipino plays in English during this period was dominated by two theater giants: Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero and Severino Montano. They established theater groups that presented mostly their own plays. Guerrero wrote and directed about 100 plays in English. Some of his most popular plays were <strong><em>Wow These Americans</em></strong>, 1946; <strong><em>Perhaps</em></strong>, 1947; <strong><em>Condemned</em></strong>, 1947; <strong><em>Three Rats</em></strong>, 1948; <strong><em>Deep in My Heart</em></strong>, 1951; <strong><em>In Unity</em></strong>, 1953; and <strong><em>Our Strange Ways</em></strong>, 1953. The UP Mobile Theater, which he established in 1962, had more than 2,500 performances in English and in regional language translations, including his earlier plays such as <strong><em>Women Are Extraordinary</em></strong>, 1937;&nbsp;<em><strong>Hate Begins</strong> </em>, 1938; <strong><em>Romance in B Minor</em></strong>, 1939; <strong><em>Movie Artists</em></strong>, 1940; <strong><em>Wanted: A Chaperon</em></strong>, 1940; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/548\"><strong><em>The Forsaken&nbsp;</em><em>House</em></strong></a>, 1940; <strong><em>Forever</em></strong>, 1941; <strong><em>Condemned</em></strong>, 1944; and <strong><em>Frustrations</em></strong>, 1944. Severino Montano wrote three one-act plays&mdash;namely, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/654\"><strong>Sabina</strong></a></em></strong>; <strong><em>The&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Ladies and the Senator</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Parting at Calamba</em></strong>, all first staged in 1953; a full-length play, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/590\"><strong><em>The Love of Leonor Rivera</em></strong></a>, 1954; <strong><em>The Foolish Virgins</em></strong>, 1959; and <strong><em>The Naked Woman</em></strong>, 1959. The 200 performances of Arena Theater, which Montano established in 1953, revolved almost entirely on the first four plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Guerrero and Montano, other Filipino playwrights who wrote in English were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2945\">Jose Flores</a> who penned <strong><em>Flowers for the Dead</em></strong>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5578\">C.

Works of the following playwrights were also staged: Fidel Sicam&rsquo;s <strong><em>Seven Years</em></strong>, Julian Dacanay&rsquo;s <strong><em>Something Filipino</em></strong>, Paulina Bautista&rsquo;s <strong><em>Quiet Evening</em></strong>, Agustin Ancheta&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Wife Goes to Politics</em></strong>, Mercedes Marquez&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tomorrow May Be Kind</em></strong>, Nicolas Nu&ntilde;ez&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Stepson</em></strong>, Nemia Arroyo&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Expulsion</em></strong>, Marcelino Agana&rsquo;s <strong><em>New Yorker in Tondo</em></strong>, and Carlos Sison&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Affair</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Original Filipino Plays in Filipino and Other Philippine Languages</strong>. Original Filipino plays in Filipino and other Philippine languages during this period first emerged in the form of translations and adaptations. The plays in English of Guerrero, Montano, and Florentino were translated to Philippine languages. When Guerrero organized the UP Mobile Theater, his plays were staged in English. But later, as these plays were mounted in different regions in the country, they were translated to various regional languages. Six years after the establishment of Arena Theater in 1953, the group brought Montano&rsquo;s plays to the provinces, such as Pangasinan, Negros Occidental, and Cebu. In these regional performances, the group&rsquo;s repertoires were translated into Pangasinan, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, and Cebuano. Florentino&rsquo;s plays, which depicted the lives of the urban poor, were translated to Filipino and performed by the UP Mobile Theater, PETA, and UP Repertory Company. Moreno&rsquo;s <strong><em>Straw Patriot</em></strong>, first written in 1967, was translated into Filipino by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5675\">Wilfredo Pascua Sanchez</a> as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/517\"><strong><em><strong>Bayani</strong>ng Huwad</em></strong></a>. It was the first play staged by PETA at the new theater in Fort Santiago, also in 1967. Moreno&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Onyx Wolf</em></strong> was staged as part of the inaugural presentations at the CPP Little Theater in 1971.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not content with translation and adaptation, Filipino theater artists wrote and staged plays originally written in Filipino. Some of the earliest examples during this period are Tirso Antiporda&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hindi Ko Akalain</em></strong> (I Never Imagined), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2763\">Florentino Ballecer</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sundalong Mantika</em></strong> (Sluggard Soldier), Alberto Florentino&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sayaw ng Bayan</em></strong> (Dance of the People), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Julian Balmaseda</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dahil sa <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong></em></strong> (Because of the Child), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4803\">Gloria de Guzman</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><strong>Sisa</strong></strong></em></strong>, Bonifacio Ilagan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Buhay Nga Naman</em></strong> (That&rsquo;s Life, Indeed), and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5655\">Francisco Rodrigo</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sa Pula, sa Puti</em></strong> (Bet for the Red, for the White) (Legasto 2008, 105-6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Original Filipino plays in the national language also emerged from Paligsahang Pandulaan, a playwriting and staging competition for high school students sponsored by Dulaang Sibol and the Kagawaran ng Pilipino of Ateneo de Manila University in 1967. It produced Paul Dumol&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Puting Timamanukin</em></strong> (The White Timamanukin Bird), Tony Perez&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hoy, Boyet, Tinatawag Ka Na, <strong>Hatinggabi</strong> Na&rsquo;y Gising Ka Pa Pala</em></strong> (Hey, Boyet, They&rsquo;re Calling You, It&rsquo;s Midnight and You&rsquo;re Still Awake), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2739\">Dindo Angeles</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kandilang Naaagnas</em></strong> (Melting Candle), Guillermo Catindig&rsquo;s <strong><em>Huling Pagsisisi</em></strong> (Final Regret), and Jose Gadi&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Tinig ng Langit</em></strong> (The Voice of Heaven).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most significant examples of realism in Philippine theater is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5696\">Rogelio Sicat&rsquo;</a>s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/619\"><strong><em>Moses, Moses</em></strong></a>, 1968, first mounted by Paul Dumol at the college cafeteria of Ateneo de Manila University in 1971. Another example is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a>&rsquo;s first play, <strong><em>Timbangan Ay Tagilid</em></strong> (The Weighing Scale Is Aslant), staged by PETA in 1971. In 1972, before the declaration of martial law, PETA again mounted another one of her plays, <strong><em>Aidao</em></strong>, which focuses on the conflict between Christians and Muslims. Other realist plays written in other Philippine languages are Karl Gaspar&rsquo;s works such as <strong><em>Kinabuhi ug&nbsp;</em><em>Kamatayon sa Barrio Sudionan</em></strong> (Life and Death in Barrio Sudlonan), 1962, and <strong><em>Ang <strong><strong>Kala</strong></strong>yo sa <strong>Luha</strong></em></strong> (Fire of Tears), 1972.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realism gave way to various theater forms and styles such as street theater, theater of the absurd, and Chinese proletarian theater that use a lot of allegories and symbolisms. Several reasons demanded this transition such as the need for the stylization of representing reality to make up for the minimalist staging, and the desire to create a sense of alienation in order to cultivate among the audience a critical perspective and to ensure that the political message is transmitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A theater form that thrived during the period of activism, specifically from 1970 to 1972, was street theater or <strong>dulansangan</strong>. This new kind of theater focused on national, local, and sectoral issues, and employed a variety of theater styles. Costumes were very simple but representative, and at times, symbolic; props were minimalist and improvised. Plays were mounted during rallies, demonstrations, and marches in Plaza Miranda, Mendiola, Liwasang Bonifacio, as well as in churches, school grounds, bulding lobbies, marketplaces, plazas, and streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The political or activist theater groups of this period developed the dulansangan. <strong><em>Masaker sa Araw ng Paggawa</em></strong> (Massacre on Labor Day), 1970, penned by Bonifacio Ilagan and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3212\">Leo Rimando</a>, was mounted by Panday Sining and presented at Plaza Miranda. <strong><em>Ang Kalbaryo ni Juan de la Cruz</em></strong> (The Calvary of Juan de la Cruz), 1970, was staged by Tanghalang Bayan during the Holy Week in the streets of Manila and at Plaza Moriones. Other examples of these types of plays are <strong><em>Pakikibaka</em></strong> (The Struggle) by Kamanyang; <strong><em>Barikada</em></strong> (Barricades) and <strong><em>Tanging Paraan</em></strong> (The Only Way) by Gintong Silahis; <strong><em>Tunggalian</em></strong> (Rivalry) by Panday Sining; and <strong><em>Hukumang Bayan</em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Court) by Tanghalang Bayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Politicized theater groups and playwrights employed elements of the theater of the absurd in creating plays that incorporated absurd images and situations to highlight political and social disorder and upheaval in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Paul Dumol&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/635\"><strong>Ang Paglilitis ni Mang Serapio</strong></a></em></strong> (The Trial of Old Serapio), 1968, presented beggars prosecuting one of their peers for the crime of caring for a child which was prohibited by the beggars&rsquo; organization. The court ordered Mang Serapio&rsquo;s blinding to make him a better beggar. Panday Sining&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hukumang Tuwad</em></strong> (Kangaroo Court), 1971, focused on the trial of the&nbsp;<em>progresibong uri&nbsp;</em>(progressive class) composed of the proletariat, farmers, workers, national minority, student, teacher, and prostitute who were charged for society&rsquo;s problems by the&nbsp;<em>reaksiyonaryong uri&nbsp;</em>(reactionary class) composed of the imperialist American, landlord-comprador, and bureaucrat-capitalist. Rey de la Cruz&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kumbensiyon ng Mga Halimaw</em></strong> (A Convention of Monsters), 1971, satirized the 1971 Constitutional Convention by bringing together creatures from Philippine folklore to tackle the Philippine Constitution. <strong><em>Kabaong ng Kalokohan</em></strong> (A Coffin of Nonsense), 1972, presented two cross-dressers in a nonsensical discussion of ways to face death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>English theater dominated the period from 1946 to 1972. Foreign theater repertoire, aesthetics, and practices circulated through the productions of numerous school-based and several non-school-based theater groups especially in Manila. However, Filipino theater artists later saw the incongruity of the plays they presented with the Filipino audiences they wanted to reach. With this realization, theater artists soon found ways to bring theater closer to the people. First was through the translation or adaptation of foreign plays to Filipino and other Philippine languages; second, through the creation of original Filipino plays in English which, although still written in a foreign language, depicted Philippine social realities; and third, through the translations into Filipino of original Filipino plays in English, and later through the creation of original plays in Filipino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it was the political and social events of the mid-1960s up to 1972 that pushed theater groups and artists to reevaluate their productions. The period witnessed a radical transformation of Philippine theater that paralleled the upheaval happening in society. Filipino playwrights, directors, and artists wrote plays that analyzed the problems of society and formulated courses of action so that audiences could contribute to social transformation. These artists explored different theater traditions&mdash;from the East to the West, from foreign and local, from traditional to modern&mdash;and experimented with various forms and techniques to make sure that the message contained in their plays were communicated to the audience effectively. Furthermore, they used languages that were most persuasive and powerful to their audience&mdash;namely, Filipino and other Philippine languages. These transformations become more significant as they influenced future theater productions in Philippine theater history. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Galileo S.

The Philippine Trade Act of 1946, also known as the Bell Trade Act, reflected the lopsided tariff agreements in favor of the United States. When the Bell Trade Act was severely criticized by Filipino nationalists, the Laurel-Langley Agreement of 1955 was passed. This new agreement removed some of the provisions that give preferentiality for the former colonizer, but it still guaranteed equal opportunities for US and Filipino business interests in all areas of the Philippine economy (Schirmer and Shalom 1987, 87-88, 95). Moreover, the Military Bases Agreement of 1947 provided the United States with extensive military facilities in many parts of the Philippines for a period of 99 years. Unlike similar agreements for US military bases in other countries, the treaty placed no restrictions on the use of the bases, including the types of weapons that could be stored in these facilities (Ibid., 96-97)."

The American educational system continued to function as the most important bearer of American ideology. The public educational system under American colonial rule taught Filipinos to accept the Americans as benefactors, to forget their struggles for freedom, and to help pacify domestic opposition to US policy in the Philippines (Schirmer and Shalom 1987, 45). The curriculum taught Filipinos to trust in its relations with foreigners and to be uncritical about foreign economic control. After the war, the educational system, which remained Western and pro-American, produced a generation of young educated Filipinos who were even more receptive to the American way of life and its accompanying individualistic, competitive, and consumerist attitudes. Much of the success of the educational system in carrying out its function as a strategy of colonization is rooted in the use of English as the medium of instruction and learning. The use of English to teach and to learn &#x201C;became the wedge that separated the Filipinos from their past and later was to separate educated Filipinos from the masses of their countrymen&#x201D; (Constantino 1966, 45)."

These programs were supposed to provide venues for the exchange of cultural influences. However, the one-way cultural transmission that actually happened only intensified the Americanization of Filipinos, especially of the educated class. Recipients of these programs, mostly artists, writers, and academicians, were given grants to stay in the United States to study, lecture, observe, and immerse themselves in the American culture. Upon their return to the Philippines, they became effective carriers of foreign ideas that spread throughout Philippine academic institutions and other domains of Philippine society (Lumbera 1997, 180). Also important were the visits to the Philippines of American professors and artists who would influence the direction of Philippine arts and culture (Legasto 2008, 76)."

Radio stations aired the latest American pop songs, while television showed canned shows from the United States, including comedies, dramas, horror shows, action dramas, and variety shows. While the film industry tried to come up with original Filipino cinema, it was inundated by well-funded commercial films from Hollywood, including American melodramas, comedies, actions films (cowboy, secret agent, martial arts), and horror thrillers as well as European soft-core sex films and Italian cowboy movies. In order to compete with these imported films, some local movies produced local versions of these foreign genres."

				"value": "The political, economic, educational, and cultural opportunities benefited only a small sector of Philippine society. As a result, the economic gap between the rich and the poor widened. Toward the mid-1960s, the living conditions of the great majority of Filipinos were getting worse. The US influence on Philippine politics and economy continued, its military privileges protected and strengthened. Opposition against the government and the status quo grew louder and stronger. Because of worsening poverty, workers in the urban areas and peasants in the regions became more radical. In various schools and universities, militant student movement emerged. Mass rallies and demonstrations were met with violence. The so-called First Quarter Storm took place, marked by the following historic events: the Battle of Mendiola in Jan 1970; the people&#x2019;s congresses at Plaza Miranda, Congress, and the US Embassy, Feb-Mar 1971; and the Diliman Commune and University of the Philippines (UP) Barricades in Feb 1971 (Legasto 2004, 172-73). These changing conditions were reflected in the changes that happened in Philippine theater."

One of the main channels through which American ideology and way of life continued to be passed on to generations of young Filipino was the staging of foreign plays in English. Plays written by American or European playwrights that have so-called &#x201C;artistic merits&#x201D; based on Western standards dominated the theater scene after World War II. The school setting remained to be the center of legitimate theater productions in English. After the war, other school-based theater groups followed the lead of the <a href=\"/7/60/2754\">Ateneo Players Guild</a> established in 1921: the <a href=\"/7/60/3336\">UP Dramatic Club</a>, 1930, and the <a href=\"/7/7/2932\">Far Eastern University (FEU) Theater Guild</a>, 1934.

Onofre Pagsanghan would transform the Ateneo Dramatics Society, which regularly produced Shakespearean plays, into Dulaang Sibol, which adapted foreign plays. While the productions still worked within the framework of the foreign plays, they nevertheless consciously explored the use of the Filipino language in legitimate theater in the case of the translations, and adjusted the foreign materials to bring them closer to the Filipino audience in the case of the adaptations. In 1967, Dulaang Sibol would initiate the Paligsahang Pandulaan. This playwriting competition encouraged the Ateneo High School students to write and direct original Filipino plays.

Agudo experimented with short stories in his classroom laboratory productions. From his first batch of students in oral interpretation, the Chamber Theater Group was organized. In 1966, the American Embassy invited the group to popularize chamber theater in the Visayas and Mindanao using Filipino short stories as material. It also performed for public schools in Manila, and later the organization of public schools held an annual contest of chamber theater productions using the scripts developed by the Chamber Theater Group.

The collective spirit was extended even to the audience. Primarily, plays were written in the national language and other Philippine languages. Also, the barriers set down between the performers and the audience by the proscenium stage were dismantled. This was done by employing staging techniques that allowed performers to come from or move around the audience&#x2019;s area or by using theater styles that required the audience not only to view the performance but also to actively participate in its completion. In a way, theater artists and audiences were being educated and trained on a new kind of theater that is democratic and participatory."

As many of these spaces were not really meant for staging plays, members of theater groups mustered their creativity and resourcefulness to improvise theater equipment and other staging requirements. The impressive productions of some school-based groups and the vision of school administrators to make their institution the center of theater and cultural activities in their community, city, or region eventually led to greater support from the school administration, particularly for the construction of theater venues. The FEU Auditorium was completed in 1949 primarily for the theater productions of the FEU Drama Guild. Because the <a href=\"/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> and other performing venues in Manila were damaged by the war, the 1,020-seater FEU Auditorium became the best venue for the performing arts in Manila. The auditorium is known for its centralized air-conditioning system and revolving stage, which were uncommon features in theaters during that time. The long theater tradition at St. Paul College of Manila along Herran St (now Pedro Gil), led to the construction of the Fleur-de-Lis Auditorium, which was formally inaugurated in 1957. Because of the productions of such teacher-directors as Fr James Reuter and Daisy Avellana, the Fleur-de-Lis came to be known as &#x201C;the Broadway of Herran&#x201D; (Dalisay 2007).

When the group brought its productions to various towns and barrios all over the Philippines, it explored arenas such as rice and cane fields, plazas, markets, cockpits, and other open spaces to mount its plays.

Since the plays were mounted wherever and whenever, there was a need for such performance to use minimal props and inexpensive and improvised sets and costumes. Theater groups used choruses to project their dialogues or to represent certain objects or images. The use of the streets and other open spaces as theater venues was not so much because of the absence of a performance space but to bring the issues and the message immediately to a wider audience and to veer away from the exclusivity that characterized much of theater after the war until the mid-1960s."

However, in many other areas, starting in the 1950s, with the gradual decline of the rural economy as a result of urbanization and industrialization, the traditional sinukulo began to decline. In some urban areas, it survived because of the introduction of modern techniques of staging without changing its traditional message (Tiongson 1999c, 3). For example, in Kapitangan, Paombong, Bulacan, the full seven-night sinakulo in the 1950s was shortened. When the play was reworked in 1972, only selected scenes were staged&#x2014;from the agony in the garden to the crucifixion&#x2014;from 10:00 am to 12:00 noon on Good Friday (Tiongson as cited in Modelo 1984, 1-2). In some provinces, an element of sensationalism was added, such as the actual crucifixion of penitents in Cutud, San Pedro, San Fernando, Pampanga, since 1963 (Tiongson 1999c, 21). This attracted more local and foreign audiences to watch the play. Since the 1970s, politicized theater artists developed a new type of sinakulo. They appropriated the narrative of Christ, removing its conservative values and fusing it with sectoral concerns or by drawing parallelisms between the life and sufferings of Christ and the majority of the Filipino people (Tiongson 1999c, 3)."

Foreign theater repertoire, aesthetics, and practices circulated through the productions of numerous school-based and several non-school-based theater groups especially in Manila. However, Filipino theater artists later saw the incongruity of the plays they presented with the Filipino audiences they wanted to reach. With this realization, theater artists soon found ways to bring theater closer to the people. First was through the translation or adaptation of foreign plays to Filipino and other Philippine languages; second, through the creation of original Filipino plays in English which, although still written in a foreign language, depicted Philippine social realities; and third, through the translations into Filipino of original Filipino plays in English, and later through the creation of original plays in Filipino."

The period witnessed a radical transformation of Philippine theater that paralleled the upheaval happening in society. Filipino playwrights, directors, and artists wrote plays that analyzed the problems of society and formulated courses of action so that audiences could contribute to social transformation. These artists explored different theater traditions&#x2014;from the East to the West, from foreign and local, from traditional to modern&#x2014;and experimented with various forms and techniques to make sure that the message contained in their plays were communicated to the audience effectively. Furthermore, they used languages that were most persuasive and powerful to their audience&#x2014;namely, Filipino and other Philippine languages. These transformations become more significant as they influenced future theater productions in Philippine theater history. <span class>&#xA0;</span> "

Marcos, through Proclamation 1081, declared martial law. Congress was abolished. Censorship was enforced, and all platforms were controlled or sequestered. Curfew continued to be implemented. Many critics of the ruling party from all persuasions were incarcerated or liquidated. A heightened atmosphere of terror descended upon the country. Supported by the military and his cronies, Marcos initiated a new charter, and Bagong Lipunan (New Society) was established. On its ninth year, Jan 1981, martial law was lifted, but Marcos&rsquo;s rule continued for five more years, until events that culminated in the EDSA Revolt led to his ouster in 1986.</p>\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>The vibrant theater scene, especially among the ranks of activist youths and students of the 1970s, was one of the first to be affected by the declaration of martial law. The groups could not continue the brand of militancy developed and sustained in the late 1960s and especially during the first two years of the 1970s. The streets and universities of Metro Manila and select regions stormed by such groups as Samahang Kamanyang, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3150\">Panday Sining</a> quieted down&mdash;at least for several months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater artists were the first to regroup, reorganize, and pursue an organized program. By Jan 1973, three months after the declaration, a group led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a> which included B. Basilidez Bautista, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3251\">Jonas Sebastian</a>, Manuel Pichel, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen Fernandez</a> established <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2761\">Dulaang Babaylan</a>. In the open and official documents, Dulaang Babaylan aimed at staging professional productions and authentic revivals of traditional Philippine drama, but covertly, it provided a venue for nationalist artistic activities and some degree of protection or shelter to the endangered activists-artists of pre-martial law theater. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2901\">Fons Deza</a> of Panday Sining typified this endangered species. In Apr 1973, during Holy Week, he gamely played Christ in Babaylan&rsquo;s modern nationalist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> at the Luneta&mdash;among the first breakthroughs for theater artists amid martial law terror (Deza 1998, 10, 68-70; Tiongson 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar moves would be observed in other groups already existing before the declaration, especially those that had espoused anti-Marcos sentiments or pursued radical and revolutionary goals. In the case of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> founded in 1967, the founder <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2977\">Cecile Guidote-Alvarez</a>, who was critical of the Marcoses, had to leave the country. But martial law could not dampen the group&rsquo;s vision and programs. There were resignations and leadership shuffles, but with talents like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2960\">CB Garrucho</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3266\">Joy Soler de Castro</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2872\">Pio de Castro</a>, Felix Padilla Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3214\">Frank G. Rivera</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3247\">Len Santos</a>, Jojo Purisima, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4392\">Maryo de los Reyes</a> in its ranks, theater activities continued. Though they were not necessarily productions that directly alluded to the rapacity of the Marcoses, they presented original Filipino theater just the same. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> eventually emerged as leader, aided by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3322\">Soxie Topacio</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a>. Even Teodoro Valencia did not give up on a theater space in the ruins, the Dulaang Rajah Sulayman. PETA&rsquo;s next generation of leaders&mdash;CB Garrucho, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3148\">Manny Pambid</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3539\">Brenda Fajardo</a>, and Remmy Rikken&mdash;ensured Philippine theater&rsquo;s continuity. There was no break in the productions, even in 1972 and 1973 (Samson et al. 2008).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lino Brocka pursued realist productions; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3113\">Orlando Nadres</a> and Frank G. Rivera wrote scripts, and their works saw the light of day; Felix Padilla Jr showcased innovations in directing on colleague <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a>&rsquo;s material; and by 1977, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2788\">Fritz Bennewitz</a>, a German national from Europe&rsquo;s socialist world, began working on Brecht for the company. The magic of Dulaang Rajah Sulayman continued to work. To a good extent, PETA had reclaimed radical and revolutionary trajectories that were becoming dominant voices before the declaration. While there was real shock, fear, and anxiety accompanying the imposition of martial law, the period was just ripe for the continuation and enrichment of theater trends and productions that had been going on for several decades in the Philippine theater communities before martial law. The repressive period proved both immensely challenging and productive. It gave space eventually and pushed boundaries to many trends and directions, and evolved additional refinements. An initial overview attests to continuities and proliferations but also dissonances and counter-discourses. Established groups like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a> and PETA, both founded in 1967, persisted. University theater groups like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, and De La Salle Dramatics Guild (later becoming <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2904\">DLSU Harlequin Theatre Guild</a> in 1987), all established before martial law, weathered the difficult times and survived. Some school-based groups may possibly have been dormant in this period, but they did not exactly close shop. To be fair, martial law was not anti-theater. The military did close Abelardo Hall at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1972 after the first performance of <strong><em>Marat/Sade</em></strong> and harassed Teatro Pangkatilingban in Negros, both for their organizing and their theater activities. But military agents were also part of the audience of the Dulaang Babaylan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sinakulo</em></strong> at the Luneta, laughing at the scenes, while inquiring who the director was. It was only after some time that PETA realized there may have been spies in their membership (Cristobal 2011; Juan 2015; Lucero 2016).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quite impressive new theater groups and formations actually sprouted during this period. In the National Capital, Dulaang Babaylan&rsquo;s quick response in 1973 was followed in the same year by a reorganization of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\">Company</a> by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, which was based in the UP Diliman campus. Even the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> had established Samahan sa Dulo by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2739\">Dindo Angeles</a> and Paul Dumol in the same year. By 1974, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3334\">UP Anak-Tibawan</a> was established in UP Manila. With the arrival of PETA facilitators and artist-organizer Frank Rivera, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a> was formed in Marawi State University in the same year. In 1976, UP Diliman became home to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP)</a>, and CCP to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino (TP)</a>, led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3065\">Tony Mabesa</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>, respectively. The following year, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2958\">Gantimpala Theater Foundation Inc</a> (formerly known as Bulwagang Gantimpala Theater Foundation Inc), was established at the CCP and was dedicated to mounting the winning entries to the CCP Playwriting Contest. In the same year also, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatro Mulat ng Pilipinas</a> at UP Diliman and Teatro <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3331\">Umalohokan</a> at UP Los Ba&ntilde;os were established, along with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3302\">Teatro Tomasino</a> at the University of Santo Tomas (UST). And from 1978 to 1981, the regions were able to produce the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3004\">Integrated Performing Arts Guild (IPAG)</a> in Iligan, 1978; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3290\">Teatro Amakan</a> in Iloilo City, 1979; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3153\">Pantanghalang Sining ng Laguna (PASILAG)</a> in Laguna, 1979; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation Inc</a> in Malolos, Bulacan, 1980; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3030\">Kulturang Atin Foundation Inc (KAFI)</a> in Davao, 1981. Despite the tight control of the dictator, theater gained more shape and cohesion not only in Manila but in the provinces as well. Even the ruling establishment had its own theater formation&mdash;the Dulaang Kabataang Barangay&mdash;although this initiative hardly left an impression and is now generally forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martial law heightened contradictions and conflicting trajectories in contemporary Philippine theater history observed after World War II. The short period of about 14 years, from the declaration to the ouster of Marcos, saw the ascendancy and eventual triumph of a sizable group of Filipino playwrights writing in the vernacular and able to feed the production needs of the contemporary theater movement, especially those artists hungry for originality and discourse rooted in the nation&rsquo;s experience. Except for Repertory Philippines that produced more current successes from Broadway and London&rsquo;s West End, the theater scene was very much enlivened by the arrival of these contemporary Filipino playwrights, whose efforts started much earlier, but their definitive corpus of works was perhaps really felt only during this period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This triumph could perhaps be credited to the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3144\">Palihang Aurelio V. Tolentino (PAVT)</a> and parallel efforts and initiatives in PETA that had an active writers&rsquo;s pool from its very inception in the late 1960s. Although the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a> already had a category for playwriting in both English and Filipino, the winning entries were not systematically staged, if at all. Before PAVT, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3142\">Onofre Pagsanghan</a> had silently worked to develop expressions and vernacular texts for the performing arts for the very young and talented in Ateneo in the mid- and late 1960s. But perhaps PAVT had a good strategy and a more integrated, pluralistic program, less tied down to specific resident writers&rsquo; programs for generating texts for Philippine theater. PAVT was led again by Nicanor G. Tiongson, Jonas Sebastian, Doreen Fernandez&mdash;about the same group from Dulaang Babaylan. With the institutional support from UP Repertory, the Department of Filipino and Philippine Literature of UP Diliman, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5752\">UP Writers Club</a>, and the Cultural Research Association of the Philippines, the generous financial assistance from Vic Puyat, and the cooperation of other theater groups that eventually participated (e.g., UP Anak-Tibawan, PETA), PAVT founded a network larger than one production or theater group&mdash;something unprecedented at that time&mdash;and evolved and gave sustenance to local playwrights of the generation (Tope 2014). What made this project exemplary for the period was that it involved a workshop phase, a writing phase, a contest, and a production phase for winning entries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the four successive sets of the Palihan workshops (1974, 1976, 1978, 1979), new playwrights like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2725\">Reuel Aguila</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5071\">Mauro Avena</a>, Rosauro de la Cruz, Manuel Pambid, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4701\">Angelito Tiongson</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3186\">Nonilon Quea&ntilde;o</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5269\">Reynaldo Duque</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3154\">Jose Papa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>, Richie Valencia-Buenaventura, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3127\">Bienvenido Noriega</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a> emerged, arrived, and were greatly encouraged. Their works were staged. Generally young and inexperienced, bold, vibrant, and enchanting productions came from the winning batches. To some theater scholars and the culturati, the productions may have overused the episodic structure or were written like movie scripts (Tope 2014, 53), but their texts generated meaning, worth, and relevance for audiences that watched them. The PAVT approach was so successful that the CCP would later adopt this model for its playwriting contest whose winning entries were staged by Bulwagang Gantimpala at the CCP&rsquo;s experimental space starting in 1997.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering national contexts and international standards of that time, and looking at how the theater community reacted in the early days of martial law as seen in the works of the Babaylan theater group and the PAVT and the parallel efforts made by PETA, the CCP, Ateneo, and UP Repertory Company, and at how regional theater groups like Sining Kambayoka, Teatro Umalohokan, IPAG, Teatro Amakan, PASILAG, Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation, KAFI, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3268\">Sorsogon&rsquo;s Community Based Theater Group</a> (established in 1984) developed their own formations and expressions, it was quite clear that Philippine theater stood for the development of the Filipino playwright and his corpus of works was in the right path. The standard and ideal trajectory for Philippine theater at this juncture was the delivery of original and current works whose discourses were rooted in ethnic and national contexts. It had to stand with the rest of the world with a unique voice, with text, lore, themes, and issues in its own narratives and indigenous languages. Collectively, the theater community not only fought the dictatorship but also continued to shape the cultural component of the nation through a body of original plays written in the vernaculars, mounted by Filipino theater groups, and shared to a cross section of Philippine publics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Complementing the creation of a corpus of contemporary plays in the vernaculars was the revalidation and reintegration of traditional Philippine theater into the national scene. Again, Dulaang Babaylan was in the ideal trajectory here, although there had been earlier efforts from Felicidad Mendoza through the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3029\">Kudyapi Community Theater League</a> and Rolando Tinio in Ateneo de Manila University. The theater community rediscovered the earlier <strong>mandudula</strong> (playwrights)&mdash;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3202\">Tomas Remigio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2711\">Juan Abad</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>&mdash;and gave a salute to the sinakulo. After the initial success of the Babaylan sinakulo at the Luneta in 1973, other groups mounted similar productions to popularize traditional plays. Kalinangan ng Lahi, for example, performed in the asphalt jungle of Cubao, while Tanghalang Kabataan staged its plays ca. 1975 in the Pantranco vicinity. In the case of UP Anak-Tibawan, both traditional and contemporary plays were nurtured. These two complementary directions&mdash;the production of original contemporary plays and the staging of Filipino classics&mdash;intertwined to define the text for Philippine theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By having plays from the earlier periods of Philippine history vis-&agrave;-vis the growing corpus of contemporary works, originality and heritage coalesced to project a confident theater community continuously defining national theater and culture (Chua 2014). Liberated and liberative, ascendant, daring, Philippine theater from 1972 to 1986 contributed in solidifying and defining the nation, in the midst of the realities of martial law and a hierarchical society dominated by political dynasties and corrupt politicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phenomenon of theater at that time could also be viewed in the broader context of the larger organization occurring during this period. The theater community mirrored the larger national struggle to dismantle the Marcos dictatorship. In the 1970s, the youth and the studentry were once more at the forefront. The reorganization of the PETA-Metropolitan Teen Theater League (PETA-MTTL) in 1975 under <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3090\">Rosalie Matilac</a> exemplified how youthful energy could be harnessed for theater creation. As eloquently perceived by Tony Mabesa, Philippine theater is youthful energy, with mostly students in their teens to their 20s as its base. At the height of its expansion just before the 1986 EDSA Revolt, PETA-MTTL had members and affiliates in approximately 20 high schools in Metropolitan Manila doing theater work for themselves and their communities as young citizens of the land.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other sectors soon followed. In 1976, fishport workers in urban poor areas captured the attention of playwrights like Manny Pambid. Eventually, the Alyansa ng Maralita sa Sining (ALMASIN), an alliance of cultural groups in the urban poor sector, materialized, tapping resources from Bagong Barrio, Caloocan, and areas in Tondo. It was also in 1976 that the workers announced their renewed participation in the La Tonde&ntilde;a strike to clamor for the humane treatment of workers and the abolition of antilabor policies of the state. Other cultural groups would eventually be formed: Tanghalang Silangan, 1981, its unionists working in the Novaliches factory of Rubberworld Adidas, and Tambisan sa Sining Inc, whose base was the labor formation Kilusang Mayo Uno&ndash;Nasyunal. By 1985, another factory-based group, Artex Cultural Group, would become active (Barrios 1994, 129). While it is true that the religious did not seem to have created a specific theater group or even just a singing group with themselves as actors and performers, their presence during mobilizations and mass actions during the period certainly exposed their anti-dictatorship stance. Working with the religious were theater artists <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2953\">Rodulfo Galenzoga</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2961\">Karl Gaspar</a> in Mindanao, and Alan Abadesco in Negros. By 1976, the theater community and its allied sectors had made clear their anti-dictatorial sentiments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The regions were soon busy doing committed theater. PETA, through the Central Institute for Theater Arts in Southeast Asia (CITASA) program, had over the years fielded out regional coordinators and teachers to monitor and push regional development in the field of theater and culture all over the Philippines. After all, the vision of its founder was a prospectus for a national theater movement, which meant geographical cover of Philippine regions. The famous workshop in Tagum, Davao, in 1969, supposedly the first rural workshop by the company, linked Mindanao to the national network formation. Sining Kambayoka became possible only after a PETA workshop in Mindanao State University, Marawi City, in 1974. In 1976, PETA trainers hooked up with KAFI, and eventually a stronger KAFI spilled over to the Mindanao Community Theater Network. By 1984, Visayas had <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2822\">Gigi Carunungan</a> as PETA regional coordinator, Southern Tagalog and Bicol had <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2958\">Weni Gamboa</a>, and Northern and Central Luzon had <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2782\">Marichu Belarmino</a>. Local initiatives complemented by the CITASA training programs generated alliances, formations, and groups active in using theater and culture for social empowerment. For example, Teatro Umalohokan led the formation of Makabayang Alyansa sa Sining Anakpawis&ndash;Timog Katagalugan (MASA-TK), mandated to coordinate theater groups in Laguna, Cavite, Quezon, and Batangas (Samson et al. 2008, 100, 190-238). Certainly, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2956\">Joonee Gamboa</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3212\">Leo Rimando</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, each in their own ways worked to popularize theater or to establish a national network of cultural and theater groups. But more likely, it was PETA&rsquo;s summer workshops and the innumerable CITASA outreach work that really achieved the formation of a theater network. The culmination of all of PETA and CITASA&rsquo;s efforts were MAKIISA I in 1983 and MAKIISA II in 1984, directly coordinated by the premier theater company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But even as many groups, institutions, and formations were doing theater rooted in ethnic, regional, and national contexts, generally progressive and social in discourse, other discourses were being generated by other initiatives. For Teatro Pilipino which he founded in 1976, Rolando Tinio insisted on a repertoire of translations&mdash;mainly his&mdash;of Western classics, which led to the marginalization of original Filipino plays. The DUP would strike very interesting variations. Its inaugural at the Abelardo Hall Auditorium in 1976 was a Filipino translation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em>Much Ado about Nothing</em></strong>, with its founding chair and artistic director Tony Mabesa directing. Both Tinio and Mabesa had a very strong passion for Western classics, and these were the kind of materials they wanted to stage in their respective companies after they returned from their studies in the United States. And they had the influence, the support of colleagues and friends, and the structures to do this. But Mabesa did not monopolize DUP for himself&mdash;he shared it with several other directors, including the activist-theater director Behn Cervantes, whose agitprop productions for his UP Repertory Company were included in the seasons of DUP from the very first. Although Western theater in English or English translations nearly dominated the premier state university&rsquo;s offerings through DUP&rsquo;s Theater Arts Company, it could not be sustained. It only lasted from the 8th to the 12th theater season (Cortez 2006, 100). At Ateneo de Manila University, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2921\">Enterteynment para sa Tao, Bayan, Lansangan, at Diyos</a> or ENTABLADO aimed to create socially conscious theater. The theater group did exposure trips and apostolic work in depressed areas and eventually took part in the EDSA Revolt (Casumpang 2015). Since its founding year in 1985, its repertoire has consisted of original Filipino plays in the vernacular. Tanghalang Ateneo, established earlier in the 1970s, already incorporated original Filipino plays in its repertoire as early as 1979 and became a venue for playwrights like Bienvenido Noriega, Paul Dumol, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a>. At the University of Santo Tomas (UST), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2749\">Artistang Artlets</a> was established in 1980. Together with Teatro Tomasino, which was formed in 1977, this new theater group championed local plays and playwrights, mostly contemporary. After 1986, new texts from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4498\">Jun Lana</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5526\">Vim Nadera</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3325\">Jose Victor Torres</a> emerged from these groups. Meanwhile, De La Salle Dramatics Guild, already mounting Pilipino translations, adaptations of Western classics, and even original works, managed to survive until 1987 when it officially became DLSU Harlequin Theatre Guild. Both the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2932\">FEU Drama Guild</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3333\">UE Theater Company</a> took a little longer to rebuild and regain active status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the majority of theater artists, whether inside or outside the National Capital Region, were in full battle gear by 1983, the year Senator Benigno Aquino was assassinated. By then, a younger generation of theater artists had joined the community. UP <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3166\">Peryante</a> led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3102\">Chris Millado</a> mounted productions in campuses and on the streets which directly attacked the Marcoses. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5429\">Pete Lacaba</a>, Lino Brocka, and Behn Cervantes formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a>. A massive show of art and protest, with Philippine theater groups leading, was organized, with MAKIISA I staged in Dec 1983 at the Tanghalang Rajah Sulayman, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a> (Tiongson 1984), and MAKIISA II in Dec 1984 at Christ the King Seminary, Quezon City. Theater communities united to define trajectories for finer approaches to people&rsquo;s theater aesthetics, which supplanted its agitprop and allegorical roots during the pre-martial law years, as well as to clarify positions vis-&agrave;-vis the currents of national and radical social movements (Tiongson 1984; Samson et al. 2008, 265-75). People&rsquo;s theater would continue until the 1986 EDSA Revolt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By then, an impressive national network of theater groups had emerged. This network covered all the regions. From the National Capital Region came Alyansa para sa Makabayang Teatro ng Kabataan or ALAMAT, ALMASIN, Anak Ko Cultural, Artex Cultural Group, BAHAGHARI, BALIK-DULA, Dulaang Habagat, Dulaang Katig, Dulaang Palanyag, DULAMPASIGAN, HAYUMA, HONRADES, KANTA (based in Valenzuela), KISSA, LFS Cultural, Likas-Likas (based in Montalban), Lingkod-Sining, MASA, MASKARA, Muog ng Lahi, PATATAG, PETA, PETA Kalinangan Ensemble, PETA-MTTL, Pintig Kayumanggi, SAKDAL, SAMBIGKIS, SAMBISIG, SAPAGKAT, Sining, Sining Pangharing, SINTUNADO, TAHAK, TAMANABA, Tambisan, Tanghalang Silangan (predecessor of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3299\">Teatro Pabrika</a>), TANGLAW (MYF), Tanglaw ng Kabataan (Malabon), Teatro Bedista, TUKLAS, Ugnayang Pasig, UP Peryante, UP Repertory Company, and cultural formations from Carlos Albert High School, Manila Science High School, Philippine Science High School, Ramon Magsaysay High School, St. Joseph&rsquo;s College, St. Scholastica&rsquo;s Academy, and St. Theresa&rsquo;s College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From Luzon, there were Baguio Urban Poor People&rsquo;s Alliance Cultural Arm, Barasoain Kalinangan, Bataan Workers Cultural Group, Cagayan Youth Theater League, Cordillera Youth Cultural Action Program, Dulaaang Malolos, Dulaang Angeles University Foundation, KALATAS, NOBELA (Diocesan Youth), Samahan ng Kabataang Agraryo (based in Bicol), Sentro ng Kalinangang Bayan, Silang Parish Dramatic Guild, Sining Bayan, Sorsogon Community Based Theater Group, Tanghalang Dalawa Singko (based in Batangas), Teatro Umalohokan, and Ugnay-Sining (based in Angeles).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Visayas rose ACT-Cebu, Alyansa Pangkultura Sang-Iloilo, Bulalakaw Samar, Cebu Repertory Company, Dulaang Katilingban Redemptorista, Dungog Alliance of Cebu Cultural Groups, Kataluasan Calbayog, Leyte Cultural Group, NAMSU, Negros Theater Leaque, Northern Samar Theater Arts Organization, and Silaw-Gabayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And from Mindanao came Agusan-Surigao Community Theaters, Apo ni Juan, Atong Teatro, Ipil Diocese Community Theater, Kambayoka Center, Kampilan Mindanao, KAFI, Lanao Educational Arts for Development, Mindanao Development Center, SCRIPT, and Sining Malay Ensemble-KAFI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back at the theater curriculum that propelled this movement, several features may be ascertained, particularly that which propelled people&rsquo;s theater, the particular trademark and flag bearer for theater during the period of martial law up to the EDSA Revolt. The most crucial was the formulation of the orientation for Philippine theater, embodied in the acronym RPN, which stands for&nbsp;<em>repleksiyon ng pangangailangan ng nakararami&nbsp;</em>(reflecting the needs of the people), formulated in Nicanor Tiongson&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/756\">What Is Philippine Drama?</a>&rdquo; (1983). As far back as 1971, RPN was lectured in drama classes in the universities, and afterward in theater groups like Babaylan, PETA, in the Mindanao theater networks, and in the CITASA summer workshops where it served as the opening plenary orientation lecture. Later, when the Orientation-Artistic-Organizational (OAO) framework was incorporated in the PETA theater syllabus in 1978 (Samson et al. 2008, 210-14), RPN fit perfectly in the first frame. The OAO framework was not imposed, but evolved with theater artists. Generally, a Marxist view of reality dominated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly, the entire Philippine dynamics at this time was layered, with issues that come with a society divided into social classes and oppressor-oppressed dynamics. Oppressor-oppressed theater exercises, merged with Viola Spolin&rsquo;s release exercises, which were done in as playful a manner as possible, already propagated by PETA workshops even before the more sophisticated theater of the oppressed variant came. Boal&rsquo;s theater of the oppressed, with touches of Paulo Freire, also made it into the 1982-83 PETA syllabi (Samson et al. 2008, 232), and was incorporated into the Basic Integrated Theater Arts Workshop (BITAW). BITAW seemed to have had a life of its own, as workshop participants echoed what they learned in multiple communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these various strands came together to define the orientation and political stand of the people&rsquo;s theater of the period. Karl Marx, Mao Tse-tung, Amado Guerrero, and Bertolt Brecht became major influences. The bottom line was that all sought change. Quite obviously, there was already a theater community that was gaining national configuration during martial law, through the remaining Marcos years, and until the 1986 EDSA Revolt. A foreign observer labeled the movement as a &ldquo;playful revolution,&rdquo; affirming the presence and force of the national theater community not only in toppling the dictatorship but also in building and shaping a society (Erven 1992). There was never a final victory for the nationalist, radical, and revolutionary agenda, which marked theater before and during martial law. The war against the dictator succeeded, but not the radical and revolutionary goals. But neither was it a total defeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"plays\" name=\"plays\"></a>Types of Plays</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most exciting periods in the history of Philippine theater production was the period from 1972 to 1986, which generated a variety of trends, forms, techniques, styles, directions, and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Plays in English</strong>. Repertory Philippines, with cosmopolitan and corporate Makati as its base and both the Spanish and American expatriate communities as its supporters, did English language theater during the Marcos years. Even with English language theater generally declining in the schools and cultural centers during this period, Repertory Philippines proudly showcased renditions&mdash;some almost copies&mdash;of the original of Broadway and West End hits. It also successfully professionalized human resources for these productions (Ang 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many theater companies based in universities and colleges continued to mount English language plays, concentrating on the classics of Western theater, Shakespeare, Chekhov, Ibsen, and contemporary Western playwrights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Translations and Adaptations</strong>. From 1975 to 1992, Teatro Pilipino led in this trend, and some of its Pilipino translations of Western classics, notably <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong>, have been published. Almost all the other theater groups were doing translations as well. UP Repertory Company staged translations of English plays by Filipinos such as <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2943\">Alberto Florentino</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sa Bawat Sandali ng Buhay</em></strong>, from the original <strong><em>In Life&rsquo;s Every Second</em></strong>, 1973, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pagbibinyag sa Apoy at Dugo</em></strong>, from the original <strong><em>Walking Canes and Fans</em></strong>, 1975. DUP&rsquo;s inaugural was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5047\">Lilia Antonio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pagkahaba-haba Man ng Prusisyon</em></strong>, 1976, a translation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em>Much Ado about Nothing</em></strong>. PETA did <strong><em>Ang Hatol ng Guhit na Bilog</em></strong>, 1977, Franklin Osorio and Lito Tiongson&rsquo;s translation of Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</em></strong>; and <strong><em>Ang Buhay ni Galileo</em></strong>, 1981, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2968\">Alan Glinoga</a>&rsquo;s translation of <strong><em>The Life of Galileo</em></strong>. Tanghalang Ateneo mounted Ricardo Saludo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Taga sa Panahon</em></strong>, 1984, a translation of Robert Bolt&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Man for All Seasons</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local adaptations included <strong><em>Doon Po sa Amin</em></strong>, 1965, Onofre Pagsanghan&rsquo;s adaptation of Thornton Wilder&rsquo;s <strong><em>Our Town</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Sinta</em></strong>, 1973, his adaptation of <strong><em>The Fantasticks</em></strong>. Paul Dumol adapted the story of one of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></em></strong> (Subversion) characters and came out with <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/576\"><strong>Kabesang Tales</strong></a></em></strong> (Cabeza Tales), 1975, while <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a> worked on <strong><em>Nasa Puso ang Amerika</em></strong>, 1984, an adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5138\">Carlos Bulosan</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1557\">novel</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1688\"><strong><em>America Is in the Heart</em></strong></a>. In the regions, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3310\">Theater Arts Guild of the University of the Philippines College of Iloilo</a> adapted foreign works into Hiligaynon such as <strong><em>Donya Clara</em></strong>, from Friedrich Durrenmatt&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Visit</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Hacienda Roces</em></strong>, from Anton Chekhov&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Cherry Orchard</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the case of Japanese theater, Japanese theater forms, not plays, were adapted to Filipino narratives and materials. Tony Mabesa and Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio were the pioneers in exploring the possibilities of applying Japanese theater forms to Philippine materials. In 1977, the <strong>noh</strong> and <strong>kyogen</strong> were used in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/633\"><strong><em>Ang Paglalakbay ni <strong><strong>Sisa</strong></strong></em></strong> </a>(Sisa&rsquo;s Quest) and <strong><em>Ang Madyik na Sombrero</em></strong> (The Magic Hat) respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adaptations of Traditional Plays</strong>. Martial law, to an extent, provided not only a good backdrop and context for productions of traditional Philippine plays plucked from their traditional communities and the historical past. Dulaang Babaylan&rsquo;s breakthrough production of a modernized sinakulo at the Luneta a few months after the declaration of martial law succeeded in utilizing the traditional form to assert the right of the theater artist to continue to create and participate in the national discourse amid an authoritarian regime. Since censorship was enforced, the production was itself a commentary and testament to survival and creativity. Discourse-wise, the production could only openly attack commercialism, but implied was a critique of US multinationals in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since not even martial law could overpower Holy Week rituals, theater artists in the urban setting maximized the political potential of this tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as Dulaang Babaylan&rsquo;s last sinakulo, <strong><em>Kristo, Anak ng Tao</em></strong> (Christ, Son of Man), played in Isabela, Cagayan, in 1981 (Cristobal 2011; Alfon 2015), the sinakulo had, by 1983, become a favored vehicle of protest among other artists. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5785\">Virgilio Vitug</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sinakulo ning Balen</em></strong> (Passion Play of the Country) was staged in Lubao, Pampanga, with a Jesus Makabalen as the central figure (Tiongson 1994b, 30), echoing Aurelio Tolentino&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/510\"><strong>Bagong Cristo</strong></a></em></strong> (New Christ), 1907, which had Christ as a labor leader. <strong><em>Bagong Cristo</em></strong> was remounted by Anton Juan for Babaylan in 1977. Rene O. Villanueva, with Dulaang Malaya, also had a version of <strong><em>Sinakulo</em></strong>, 1981, deriving inspiration not only from Tolentino but from the dynamics of the workers&rsquo; theater group that mounted the production and the allegorical conventions of pre-martial law activist theater (Tiongson 1999c, 15-43).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from the sinakulo, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a> also saw a stage version. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/640\"><strong><em>Ang <strong>Panunuluyan</strong> ng Birhen Maria at San Jose sa Cubao, Ayala, Plaza Miranda, Atbp. Lugar sa Loob at Labas ng Metro Manila</em></strong></a> (Virgin Mary and Saint Joseph&rsquo;s Search for an Inn in Cubao, Ayala, Plaza Miranda, and Other Places Inside and Outside Metro Manila) was performed in Dulaang Rajah Sulayman in 1979. It showed Mary and Joseph visiting various communities of the urban poor in Metro Manila and understanding the plight of the Filipino majority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, Aurelio Tolentino&rsquo;s <strong><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\">drama simboliko</a>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow), 1976-77, produced by Babaylan and directed by Anton Juan, would make it to a theater space at the CCP and even in France. Somehow, the allegorical and historical frames of the narrative reverberated with similar formulations from the agitprop allegories of pre-martial law activist theater. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3202\">Tomas Remigio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/615\"><strong>Mga Santong Tao</strong></a></em></strong> (People Saints), with its biting commentary on a stratified society and the ruling classes&rsquo; corruption at the very core, was staged by Tanghalang Kabataan in 1975, and by UP Manila&rsquo;s Anak-Tibawan in 1983. At the CCP, Rolando Tinio directed <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/582\"><strong>Ang Kiri</strong></a></em></strong> (The Flirt), 1974, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></em></strong> (Orosman and Zafira), 1977, the latter a rare exception to the Western-text preference of TP. UP Anak-Tibawan also staged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/648\"><strong>R.I.P.</strong></a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/579\"><strong>Ang Kalupi</strong></a></em></strong> (The Wallet), 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UP Repertory Company, under the artistic direction of Behn Cervantes, worked on Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/525\"><strong>Ang Bundok</strong></a></em></strong> (The Mountain), 1976, merging agitprop style with sarsuwela conventions. In this play, mountain people had to unite to fight foreign speculators digging for gold in the Cordilleras. By 1982, Nicanor G. Tiongson&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907) by PETA, under Soxie Topacio&rsquo;s direction, would showcase artistic excellence in dramaturgy and the handling of the traditional form on stage, and provide validation for continuing the tradition for the contemporary audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Indigenous Forms</strong>. The period after World War II, extending up to martial law, heightened other concerns by theater artists, such as the use of local languages and indigenous theater forms. Frank Rivera&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/613\"><strong><em>Mga Kuwentong Maranaw</em></strong></a> (Maranao Tales), 1974, as well as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/554\"><strong><em><strong>Halik</strong> sa Kampilan</em></strong></a> (Kiss on the Sword), 1978, use the indigenous <strong>bayok</strong> (debate in chant) as structural pegs for the plays and the accompanying poetic or chanted renditions. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2953\">Rodulfo Galenzoga</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/600\"><strong>Maranatha</strong></a></em></strong> (Make Haste, Lord), 1974, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3203\">Fe Remotigue</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5552\">Don Pagusara</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/664\"><strong>Sinalimba</strong></a></em></strong> (Magic Boat), 1986, used the dance drama genre for their plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In these productions, the lumad and Muslim traditions were creatively used by Mindanao theater artists and their audiences. The&nbsp;<em>kapamalong-malong&nbsp;</em>(a dance that uses the tubular skirt called&nbsp;<em>malong</em>), the various non-Christian Mindanao lore, and their costumes, textile, and dances were maximized to give productions coming from Mindanao local color and an authentic Mindanao feel. Even Fritz Bennewitz&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Hatol ng Guhit na Bilog</em></strong> (<strong><em>The&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Caucasian Chalk Circle</em></strong>), staged in Manila, carried a similar preference. CB Garrucho&rsquo;s portrayal of the queen even showcased her&nbsp;<em>janggay&nbsp;</em>(metal claws) and&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/78\">pangalay</a>&nbsp;</em>dance skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Historical Plays</strong>. Activism during the 1960s and the 1970s placed premium on knowledge of Philippine history. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5007\">Teodoro Agoncillo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5181\">Renato Constantino</a> were required and prized readings, before Amado Guerrero and Mao Tse-tung. In the case of playwrights of the period, historical materials became subjects of their texts for the stage. The pivotal historical epochs would be the revolution in the late 19th century; the various rebellions that preceded the revolution; the Filipino-American War, specially the events clustering on the drama simboliko and playwright Aurelio Tolentino; and to a lesser extent, the Japanese period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interest in Rizal&rsquo;s fiction as history led Paul Dumol to write his powerful <strong><em>Kabesang Tales</em></strong> (Cabeza Tales), 1975, which showed the peasant as revolutionary. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5435\">Domingo Landicho</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Unang Alay</em></strong> (First Offering), 1975, had one of the first takes on <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>. Fernando Josef&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Tao &hellip; Hayop o Tao</em></strong> (Man &hellip; Animal or Man), 1975, was on the Dagohoy revolt. Lito Tiongson&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Walang Kamatayang Buhay ni Juan de la Cruz, Alyas &hellip; (Isang Kronika ng Digmaang Pilipino-Amerikano 1900-1902)</em></strong> (The Deathless Life of Juan de la Cruz, Alias &hellip; A Chronicle of the Filipino-American War 1900-1902), 1976, was on the Philippine American War.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <strong><em>Walang Kamatayang Buhay ni Juan de la Cruz</em></strong>, it became very clear that these excursions into past epochs were representations of contemporary events such as hamletting and heightened militarization. Eventually, critics and scholars would refer to this technique as the theater of circumvention (Lumbera 1987), similar to the allegorical drama simboliko at the turn of the 20th century. In these plays, lines alluded to events in distant or fictive settings, but audiences and the actors cross-referenced these to current events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other historical plays were Bonifacio Ilagan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Katipunan: Mga Anak ng Bayan</em></strong> (Katipunan: Sons of the People), 1978, staged by Bulwagang Gantimpala and also mounted as <strong><em>Sigaw ng Bayan</em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Cry) by Behn Cervantes for UP Repertory Company in the same year. This was followed by <strong><em>Estados Unidos bersus Cruz, Abad at Tolentino</em></strong> (United States versus Cruz, Abad and Tolentino), 1981, also by Ilagan and Cervantes and the UP Repertory Company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anton Juan&rsquo;s mounting of Aurelio Tolentino&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong>, 1976, earlier made famous by Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/741\"><strong><em>The &ldquo;Seditious&rdquo; Tagalog Playwrights: Early American Occupation</em></strong></a> published 1972, must have made a deep impression on playwrights and other theater artists. They took bits of seditious plays and the theater artist-heroes&rsquo; lives as core or takeoff materials for contemporary playwriting as seen in two 1983 productions: <strong><em>Tolentino!</em></strong> by Edgar Maranan, staged by Bulwagang Gantimpala, and <strong><em>Isang Rihersal</em></strong> (A Rehearsal) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a> for PETA. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4496\">Joel Lamangan</a> did it with <strong><em>Isang Rehersal</em></strong>, and Chris Millado would bring Tolentino closer to the NPA period and the national democratic movement in his <strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong>, PETA, 1991.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1983, UP Peryante would cover the more recent historical material of the peasant movement just before World War II, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4431\">Marina Feleo-Gonzalez</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/534\"><strong>Dahong Palay</strong></a></em></strong>, direction and adaptation by Chris Millado. Eventually, the Japanese occupation would be reflected in Jose Dalisay&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sugatang Lawin</em></strong> (Wounded Eagle), 1978, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/637\"><strong>Pagsabog ng Liwanag</strong></a></em></strong> (Burst of Light), 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\"><strong>Realism</strong></a></strong>. An early example of a realist style for this period, both in the mounting and the script, is Orlando Nadres&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/642\"><strong>Paraisong Parisukat</strong></a></em></strong> (Square Eden), 1974, which had one setting for all scenes, capturing the specific ambience of a cramped stockroom above a shoe store space in real life. As conceived in the play&rsquo;s script, the set, the costumes, and the acting would be realistic. Nadres, though, never seemed to have fully incorporated in his fictive creations the social complexities of the period, but this would turn out to become the paramount preoccupation of the younger generation of writers composed of Nonilon Quea&ntilde;o, Bonifacio Ilagan, and Rene O. Villanueva. While maintaining the verisimilitude of settings and accompanying action on stages, their brand of realism underlined concerns for social analysis and the depiction of social realities. More than a mounting style in theater as seen in the sets, costumes, and the execution, realism became an obligation for writers to analyze their society and depict them on stage. Class issues and antagonisms were among the first to surface. Workers&rsquo; issues, along with the conflict between capitalist and labor, had earlier been confronted in Bonifacio Ilagan and Panday Sining&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>Welga! Welga!</strong></a></strong></strong></em></strong> (Strike! Strike!), staged first on 25 Jan 1972 and remounted in 1986.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sans obvious class delineation, other playwrights produced plays that evoked social analysis and a critique of the oppressor-oppressed relationships. Tony Perez&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/519\"><strong>Biyaheng Timog</strong></a></em></strong> (Trip to the South), 1984, explored feudalism, patriarchy, and family history, while Reuel Aguila&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/563\"><strong>In Dis Korner</strong></a></em></strong> (In This Corner), 1978, exposed the system of game fixing in the boxing world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, martial law itself and its effects on individuals, communities, and sectors became the subject matter of plays. Rene O. Villanueva&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/604\"><strong>May Isang Sundalo</strong></a></em></strong> (There Was a Soldier), 1982, was among the earliest to tackle and analyze the martial law setup. It problematized a soldier&rsquo;s involvement in the oppressive military operations of the regime. Three years after, Chris Millado&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/526\"><strong>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</strong></a></em></strong> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major), 1985, took the analysis to a more summative and national scale, representing the experiences and points of views on martial law of peasants, workers, the religious, the studentry, the affluent class, the ethnic minority, and even the police force, with all equally condemning the oppressive regime. In 1983, Bienvenido Noriega&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/514\"><strong>Batang Pro</strong></a></em></strong> (Child Prostitutes) appeared, showing how even children suffer mercilessly as sex tourism proliferated during the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eventually, gender issues began to fascinate playwrights, both on the personal and social levels. The gay community probably had their first manifesto on stage with Orlando Nadres&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/556\"><strong><em>Hanggang Dito na Lamang at Maraming <strong>Salam</strong>at</em></strong></a> (This Is as Far as I Go, and Many Thanks), 1974. Issues on the Filipino diaspora and the travails of the overseas Filipino were tackled in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/516\"><strong>Bayan-bayanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Little Country), 1975, while the elderly became the focus in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/558\"><strong>Hiblang Abo</strong></a></em></strong> (Strands of Grey), 1980.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Epic</strong> Theater</strong>. The reaction to authoritarian rule broadened the existing vocabulary of theater. Politicized Filipino artists and critics continuously seeking alternative ways to wrestle with artistic creations in settings that had grown far more complex and demanding, rediscovered Brecht and his practice. Challenged by the art and theoretical formulations of the master, certain features of playwriting and productions were identified as Brechtian or epic theater or theater of instruction, such as the nonconventional presentational style employing mime, song, and dance. The use of slides and other technical innovations, and the stylization of costumes and sets were also explored. Folklore and history were tapped as sources for characters and narratives (Torres-Reyes 1994, 71). Al Santos&rsquo;s use of life-size dummies as substitute for real actors for the torture scenes in his <strong><em>Mene, Mene Tekel Upharsin</em></strong> (Your Days Are Numbered), 1982, and Chris Millado&rsquo;s use of mask in his <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/562\"><strong><em>Ilokula</em></strong></a> productions, 1983, would fit the category, as would some Bonifacio Ilagan and Behn Cervantes collaborations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Epic theater also covered techniques and methods learned from Peking Opera productions popular to theater artists&ndash;activists at that time. To a certain degree during this period, Brechtian theater, people&rsquo;s theater, and activists&rsquo; theater overlapped. Brechtian also generally connoted a nonrealist style of theater mounting. Some critics and commentators saw in Rolando Tinio&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/605\"><strong>May Katwiran ang Katwiran</strong></a></em></strong> (Reason Has Its Reason) and Paul Dumol&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kabesang Tales</em></strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/635\"><strong><em>Ang</em></strong> </a><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/635\"><strong>Paglilitis ni Mang Serapio</strong></a> </em>(The Trial of Old Serapio) techniques and devices learned from Brecht.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The documentary style, a trend in productions in this period first noticed by Tiongson (1994), may also exemplify the meaning of Brechtian or epic. The use of slides in theater productions to project photos taken from real events, approximating news coverage or newspaper accounts, is one innovation characteristic of the documentary theater or style. Al Santos&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/607\"><strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno Atbp. Kabanata</em></strong></a> (May 21 and Other Chapters), 1977, added to this technology the use of narrators for an overall narrative effect, projecting what was happening on stage as historically accurate or nonfiction. The play covered historical vignettes from the Spanish period to the American, the Japanese, and then the present. Joel Lamangan&rsquo;s direction of <strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno</em></strong> used recycled newspaper and magazine photos of the<em>kapatiran</em>Lapiang Malaya and its leader Valentin de los Santos, particularly the massacre that transpired on that date. Lamangan would reprise this style in his <strong><em>Bien Aligtad</em></strong>, 1983.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PETA&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/601\"><strong><em>Mariang <strong>Aliw</strong></em></strong></a> (Maria the Woman of Pleasure), 1983, a play on prostitutes, followed this trend. It also used slides of actual establishments and places where the trade flourished. The whole cast and crew actually developed the play. About 15 PETA actors conducted visits to these establishments, and observed and interviewed prostitutes. In the actual production, an offstage voice throwing questions to the characters onstage served as narrative frame and sequence guide, and the whole production appeared like an interview session with prostitutes, serving as a documentation of their lives and trade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tula-Dula (Poem-Play)</strong>. Theater during martial law contributed one original genre to the rich tapestry of modern Philippine theater forms&mdash;the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/481\"><strong>tula-dula</strong></a>. This is credited to the UP Repertory Company. A performance designed for mass actions and rallies, it features a narrator, who delivers the lines of the poem, and one or two movers miming the action of characters in the poem. The narrator generally uses a microphone or a megaphone for the huge audience to hear the play. The first tula-dula used a previously written poem, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5429\">Jose Lacaba</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/611\">Ang mga Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan de la Cruz</a>&rdquo; (The Amazing Adventures of Juan de la Cruz) for the performance. Eventually other poems were seen as good material for tula-dula mountings like Richie Valencia and Ed Vencio&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/569\"><strong><em>Mga Unang Araw sa Buhay ng <strong>Iskolar ng Bayan</strong></em></strong></a> (First Few Days in the Life of a New Scholar of the People), 1976, which gave birth to the character Isko, the student in the state university. After its initial employment in 1975, the form developed and had many variations, and poems would be specifically written for stage mounting (Dacanay 2009) such as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/680\"><strong><em><strong>Titser</strong> ng Bayan</em></strong></a> (People&rsquo;s Teacher), which was performed from the late 1970s to the early 1980s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dula-<strong>Awit</strong>-Sayaw (Dance <strong>Musical</strong>s)</strong>. The 1983 PETA production <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/626\"><em><strong>Nukleyar</strong>!</em></a> (Nuclear!) embodied a loosely strung rock band concert, with the singing accompanied by dancing and dramatic improvisations. Without a definite narrative spine, it projected a more issue-oriented production that highlighted the dangers confronting the Philippines with the Bataan nuclear power plant project. Similarly incorporating music, choreography, and dramatic scenes together, but with clearer and more solid narratives were Gines Tan&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/935\"><strong>Magsimula Ka</strong></a></em></strong> (Make a Start), 1983, which was about fresh graduates pursuing dreams in spite of parental control, and Dong de los Reyes&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bien Aligtad</em></strong>, 1985, which focused on the effects of militarization on slum dwellers. Theater artists from Mindanao explored this form as well. Tapping into the region&rsquo;s rich culture, they came up with <strong><em>Maranatha</em></strong>, 1974, <strong><em><strong>Halik sa Kampilan</strong></em></strong>, 1978, <strong><em>Ranaw: Isang Alamat</em></strong> (Ranaw: A Legend), 1985, and <strong><em>Sinalimba</em></strong>, 1986, which all incorporated local music, costume, and dances into the narrative (Tiongson 1994b, 29).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martial law was a historical condition imposed on the theater community in 1972. Before its imposition, a relatively good segment of that community had already become radicalized and had already succeeded in forming influential theater groups and networks, particularly in the National Capital Region, but eventually also in the regions. The vanguards and trainees of this advance force eventually reestablished their links and influence in the community when the imposition happened and remarkably led the community to a good fight and a good harvest. Some groups had more participation than others in this undertaking, some individuals were more prominent in battle, but the theater community was generally against martial rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The period from 1972 to 1986 may be seen as both protest and procreation. There was the very real battle against the dictatorship. The regions too fought, with very strong currents in Mindanao, Negros, and Bicol generally following Manila&rsquo;s compass and trends. But it was also during this period that playwrights developed original works using indigenous languages, lore, narratives, themes, and issues. Viewed as solidifying and enriching the cultural component of nation building, these works could be seen as the period&rsquo;s gain. The harvest to date still needs thorough documentation and publication. But enough material exists, already seen in subsequent productions or publications, even if so much data and artifacts, including texts, still have to be retrieved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vast, varied repertoire and vocabulary emerged during this period. Immersion in social and political realities, including the reality that was the dictatorship and its oppressive character, unleashed the talent and resources of theater artists, individually and collectively. It certainly broadened the vocabulary of styles, trends, and forms of theater in the country. And with the success of the people&rsquo;s theater, the MAKIISA events, as well as earlier achievements that reached national proportions, Philippine theater rooted in indigenous culture, enriched by outside influences, and conscious of the Filipino people it serves, prevailed. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2840\">Apolonio B.

Censorship was enforced, and all platforms were controlled or sequestered. Curfew continued to be implemented. Many critics of the ruling party from all persuasions were incarcerated or liquidated. A heightened atmosphere of terror descended upon the country. Supported by the military and his cronies, Marcos initiated a new charter, and Bagong Lipunan (New Society) was established. On its ninth year, Jan 1981, martial law was lifted, but Marcos&#x2019;s rule continued for five more years, until events that culminated in the EDSA Revolt led to his ouster in 1986."

The groups could not continue the brand of militancy developed and sustained in the late 1960s and especially during the first two years of the 1970s. The streets and universities of Metro Manila and select regions stormed by such groups as Samahang Kamanyang, <a href=\"/7/60/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a>, <a href=\"/7/60/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>, and <a href=\"/7/60/3150\">Panday Sining</a> quieted down&#x2014;at least for several months."

By Jan 1973, three months after the declaration, a group led by <a href=\"/7/7/3316\">Nicanor Tiongson</a> which included B. Basilidez Bautista, <a href=\"/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan Jr</a>, <a href=\"/7/60/3251\">Jonas Sebastian</a>, Manuel Pichel, and <a href=\"/9/9/5291\">Doreen Fernandez</a> established <a href=\"/7/7/2761\">Dulaang Babaylan</a>. In the open and official documents, Dulaang Babaylan aimed at staging professional productions and authentic revivals of traditional Philippine drama, but covertly, it provided a venue for nationalist artistic activities and some degree of protection or shelter to the endangered activists-artists of pre-martial law theater. <a href=\"/7/7/2901\">Fons Deza</a> of Panday Sining typified this endangered species. In Apr 1973, during Holy Week, he gamely played Christ in Babaylan&#x2019;s modern nationalist <a href=\"/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> at the Luneta&#x2014;among the first breakthroughs for theater artists amid martial law terror (Deza 1998, 10, 68-70; Tiongson 2013)."

In the case of the <a href=\"/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> founded in 1967, the founder <a href=\"/7/7/2977\">Cecile Guidote-Alvarez</a>, who was critical of the Marcoses, had to leave the country. But martial law could not dampen the group&#x2019;s vision and programs. There were resignations and leadership shuffles, but with talents like <a href=\"/7/7/2960\">CB Garrucho</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/3266\">Joy Soler de Castro</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/2872\">Pio de Castro</a>, Felix Padilla Jr, <a href=\"/7/60/3214\">Frank G. Rivera</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/3247\">Len Santos</a>, Jojo Purisima, and <a href=\"/4/4/4392\">Maryo de los Reyes</a> in its ranks, theater activities continued. Though they were not necessarily productions that directly alluded to the rapacity of the Marcoses, they presented original Filipino theater just the same. <a href=\"/4/26/4303\">Lino Brocka</a> eventually emerged as leader, aided by <a href=\"/7/60/3322\">Soxie Topacio</a> and <a href=\"/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a>. Even Teodoro Valencia did not give up on a theater space in the ruins, the Dulaang Rajah Sulayman. PETA&#x2019;s next generation of leaders&#x2014;CB Garrucho, <a href=\"/7/60/3148\">Manny Pambid</a>, <a href=\"/3/17/3539\">Brenda Fajardo</a>, and Remmy Rikken&#x2014;ensured Philippine theater&#x2019;s continuity. There was no break in the productions, even in 1972 and 1973 (Samson et al. 2008)."

Rivera wrote scripts, and their works saw the light of day; Felix Padilla Jr showcased innovations in directing on colleague <a href=\"/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a>&#x2019;s material; and by 1977, <a href=\"/7/60/2788\">Fritz Bennewitz</a>, a German national from Europe&#x2019;s socialist world, began working on Brecht for the company. The magic of Dulaang Rajah Sulayman continued to work. To a good extent, PETA had reclaimed radical and revolutionary trajectories that were becoming dominant voices before the declaration. While there was real shock, fear, and anxiety accompanying the imposition of martial law, the period was just ripe for the continuation and enrichment of theater trends and productions that had been going on for several decades in the Philippine theater communities before martial law. The repressive period proved both immensely challenging and productive. It gave space eventually and pushed boundaries to many trends and directions, and evolved additional refinements. An initial overview attests to continuities and proliferations but also dissonances and counter-discourses. Established groups like <a href=\"/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a> and PETA, both founded in 1967, persisted. University theater groups like <a href=\"/7/60/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a>, <a href=\"/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a>, and De La Salle Dramatics Guild (later becoming <a href=\"/7/60/2904\">DLSU Harlequin Theatre Guild</a> in 1987), all established before martial law, weathered the difficult times and survived. Some school-based groups may possibly have been dormant in this period, but they did not exactly close shop. To be fair, martial law was not anti-theater. The military did close Abelardo Hall at the University of the Philippines (UP) in 1972 after the first performance of <strong><em>Marat/Sade</em></strong> and harassed Teatro Pangkatilingban in Negros, both for their organizing and their theater activities. But military agents were also part of the audience of the Dulaang Babaylan&#x2019;s <strong><em>Sinakulo</em></strong> at the Luneta, laughing at the scenes, while inquiring who the director was. It was only after some time that PETA realized there may have been spies in their membership (Cristobal 2011; Juan 2015; Lucero 2016)."

In the National Capital, Dulaang Babaylan&#x2019;s quick response in 1973 was followed in the same year by a reorganization of the <a href=\"/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory </a><a href=\"/6/49/131\">Company</a> by <a href=\"/7/60/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, which was based in the UP Diliman campus. Even the <a href=\"/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a> had established Samahan sa Dulo by <a href=\"/7/60/2739\">Dindo Angeles</a> and Paul Dumol in the same year. By 1974, <a href=\"/7/7/3334\">UP Anak-Tibawan</a> was established in UP Manila. With the arrival of PETA facilitators and artist-organizer Frank Rivera, <a href=\"/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a> was formed in Marawi State University in the same year. In 1976, UP Diliman became home to <a href=\"/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP)</a>, and CCP to <a href=\"/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino (TP)</a>, led by <a href=\"/7/7/3065\">Tony Mabesa</a> and <a href=\"/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>, respectively. The following year, <a href=\"/7/60/2958\">Gantimpala Theater Foundation Inc</a> (formerly known as Bulwagang Gantimpala Theater Foundation Inc), was established at the CCP and was dedicated to mounting the winning entries to the CCP Playwriting Contest. In the same year also, <a href=\"/7/7/3304\">Teatro Mulat ng Pilipinas</a> at UP Diliman and Teatro <a href=\"/7/7/3331\">Umalohokan</a> at UP Los Ba&#xF1;os were established, along with <a href=\"/7/60/3302\">Teatro Tomasino</a> at the University of Santo Tomas (UST). And from 1978 to 1981, the regions were able to produce the <a href=\"/7/7/3004\">Integrated Performing Arts Guild (IPAG)</a> in Iligan, 1978; <a href=\"/7/60/3290\">Teatro Amakan</a> in Iloilo City, 1979; <a href=\"/7/7/3153\">Pantanghalang Sining ng Laguna (PASILAG)</a> in Laguna, 1979; <a href=\"/7/60/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation Inc</a> in Malolos, Bulacan, 1980; and <a href=\"/7/7/3030\">Kulturang Atin Foundation Inc (KAFI)</a> in Davao, 1981. Despite the tight control of the dictator, theater gained more shape and cohesion not only in Manila but in the provinces as well. Even the ruling establishment had its own theater formation&#x2014;the Dulaang Kabataang Barangay&#x2014;although this initiative hardly left an impression and is now generally forgotten."

The short period of about 14 years, from the declaration to the ouster of Marcos, saw the ascendancy and eventual triumph of a sizable group of Filipino playwrights writing in the vernacular and able to feed the production needs of the contemporary theater movement, especially those artists hungry for originality and discourse rooted in the nation&#x2019;s experience. Except for Repertory Philippines that produced more current successes from Broadway and London&#x2019;s West End, the theater scene was very much enlivened by the arrival of these contemporary Filipino playwrights, whose efforts started much earlier, but their definitive corpus of works was perhaps really felt only during this period."

				"value": "This triumph could perhaps be credited to the <a href=\"/7/7/3144\">Palihang Aurelio V. Tolentino (PAVT)</a> and parallel efforts and initiatives in PETA that had an active writers&#x2019;s pool from its very inception in the late 1960s. Although the <a href=\"/9/80/5159\">Don Carlos Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature</a> already had a category for playwriting in both English and Filipino, the winning entries were not systematically staged, if at all. Before PAVT, <a href=\"/7/60/3142\">Onofre Pagsanghan</a> had silently worked to develop expressions and vernacular texts for the performing arts for the very young and talented in Ateneo in the mid- and late 1960s. But perhaps PAVT had a good strategy and a more integrated, pluralistic program, less tied down to specific resident writers&#x2019; programs for generating texts for Philippine theater. PAVT was led again by Nicanor G. Tiongson, Jonas Sebastian, Doreen Fernandez&#x2014;about the same group from Dulaang Babaylan. With the institutional support from UP Repertory, the Department of Filipino and Philippine Literature of UP Diliman, the <a href=\"/9/9/5752\">UP Writers Club</a>, and the Cultural Research Association of the Philippines, the generous financial assistance from Vic Puyat, and the cooperation of other theater groups that eventually participated (e.g., UP Anak-Tibawan, PETA), PAVT founded a network larger than one production or theater group&#x2014;something unprecedented at that time&#x2014;and evolved and gave sustenance to local playwrights of the generation (Tope 2014). What made this project exemplary for the period was that it involved a workshop phase, a writing phase, a contest, and a production phase for winning entries."

Generally young and inexperienced, bold, vibrant, and enchanting productions came from the winning batches. To some theater scholars and the culturati, the productions may have overused the episodic structure or were written like movie scripts (Tope 2014, 53), but their texts generated meaning, worth, and relevance for audiences that watched them. The PAVT approach was so successful that the CCP would later adopt this model for its playwriting contest whose winning entries were staged by Bulwagang Gantimpala at the CCP&#x2019;s experimental space starting in 1997."

The standard and ideal trajectory for Philippine theater at this juncture was the delivery of original and current works whose discourses were rooted in ethnic and national contexts. It had to stand with the rest of the world with a unique voice, with text, lore, themes, and issues in its own narratives and indigenous languages. Collectively, the theater community not only fought the dictatorship but also continued to shape the cultural component of the nation through a body of original plays written in the vernaculars, mounted by Filipino theater groups, and shared to a cross section of Philippine publics."

After the initial success of the Babaylan sinakulo at the Luneta in 1973, other groups mounted similar productions to popularize traditional plays. Kalinangan ng Lahi, for example, performed in the asphalt jungle of Cubao, while Tanghalang Kabataan staged its plays ca. 1975 in the Pantranco vicinity. In the case of UP Anak-Tibawan, both traditional and contemporary plays were nurtured.

The reorganization of the PETA-Metropolitan Teen Theater League (PETA-MTTL) in 1975 under <a href=\"/7/60/3090\">Rosalie Matilac</a> exemplified how youthful energy could be harnessed for theater creation. As eloquently perceived by Tony Mabesa, Philippine theater is youthful energy, with mostly students in their teens to their 20s as its base. At the height of its expansion just before the 1986 EDSA Revolt, PETA-MTTL had members and affiliates in approximately 20 high schools in Metropolitan Manila doing theater work for themselves and their communities as young citizens of the land."

Eventually, the Alyansa ng Maralita sa Sining (ALMASIN), an alliance of cultural groups in the urban poor sector, materialized, tapping resources from Bagong Barrio, Caloocan, and areas in Tondo. It was also in 1976 that the workers announced their renewed participation in the La Tonde&#xF1;a strike to clamor for the humane treatment of workers and the abolition of antilabor policies of the state. Other cultural groups would eventually be formed: Tanghalang Silangan, 1981, its unionists working in the Novaliches factory of Rubberworld Adidas, and Tambisan sa Sining Inc, whose base was the labor formation Kilusang Mayo Uno&#x2013;Nasyunal. By 1985, another factory-based group, Artex Cultural Group, would become active (Barrios 1994, 129). While it is true that the religious did not seem to have created a specific theater group or even just a singing group with themselves as actors and performers, their presence during mobilizations and mass actions during the period certainly exposed their anti-dictatorship stance. Working with the religious were theater artists <a href=\"/7/60/2953\">Rodulfo Galenzoga</a> and <a href=\"/7/60/2961\">Karl Gaspar</a> in Mindanao, and Alan Abadesco in Negros.

PETA, through the Central Institute for Theater Arts in Southeast Asia (CITASA) program, had over the years fielded out regional coordinators and teachers to monitor and push regional development in the field of theater and culture all over the Philippines. After all, the vision of its founder was a prospectus for a national theater movement, which meant geographical cover of Philippine regions. The famous workshop in Tagum, Davao, in 1969, supposedly the first rural workshop by the company, linked Mindanao to the national network formation. Sining Kambayoka became possible only after a PETA workshop in Mindanao State University, Marawi City, in 1974. In 1976, PETA trainers hooked up with KAFI, and eventually a stronger KAFI spilled over to the Mindanao Community Theater Network. By 1984, Visayas had <a href=\"/7/7/2822\">Gigi Carunungan</a> as PETA regional coordinator, Southern Tagalog and Bicol had <a href=\"/7/60/2958\">Weni Gamboa</a>, and Northern and Central Luzon had <a href=\"/7/60/2782\">Marichu Belarmino</a>. Local initiatives complemented by the CITASA training programs generated alliances, formations, and groups active in using theater and culture for social empowerment. For example, Teatro Umalohokan led the formation of Makabayang Alyansa sa Sining Anakpawis&#x2013;Timog Katagalugan (MASA-TK), mandated to coordinate theater groups in Laguna, Cavite, Quezon, and Batangas (Samson et al. 2008, 100, 190-238). Certainly, <a href=\"/7/60/2956\">Joonee Gamboa</a>, <a href=\"/7/60/3212\">Leo Rimando</a>, and <a href=\"/7/7/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>, each in their own ways worked to popularize theater or to establish a national network of cultural and theater groups. But more likely, it was PETA&#x2019;s summer workshops and the innumerable CITASA outreach work that really achieved the formation of a theater network. The culmination of all of PETA and CITASA&#x2019;s efforts were MAKIISA I in 1983 and MAKIISA II in 1984, directly coordinated by the premier theater company."

				"value": "But even as many groups, institutions, and formations were doing theater rooted in ethnic, regional, and national contexts, generally progressive and social in discourse, other discourses were being generated by other initiatives. For Teatro Pilipino which he founded in 1976, Rolando Tinio insisted on a repertoire of translations&#x2014;mainly his&#x2014;of Western classics, which led to the marginalization of original Filipino plays. The DUP would strike very interesting variations. Its inaugural at the Abelardo Hall Auditorium in 1976 was a Filipino translation of Shakespeare&#x2019;s <strong><em>Much Ado about Nothing</em></strong>, with its founding chair and artistic director Tony Mabesa directing. Both Tinio and Mabesa had a very strong passion for Western classics, and these were the kind of materials they wanted to stage in their respective companies after they returned from their studies in the United States. And they had the influence, the support of colleagues and friends, and the structures to do this. But Mabesa did not monopolize DUP for himself&#x2014;he shared it with several other directors, including the activist-theater director Behn Cervantes, whose agitprop productions for his UP Repertory Company were included in the seasons of DUP from the very first. Although Western theater in English or English translations nearly dominated the premier state university&#x2019;s offerings through DUP&#x2019;s Theater Arts Company, it could not be sustained. It only lasted from the 8th to the 12th theater season (Cortez 2006, 100). At Ateneo de Manila University, <a href=\"/7/7/2921\">Enterteynment para sa Tao, Bayan, Lansangan, at Diyos</a> or ENTABLADO aimed to create socially conscious theater. The theater group did exposure trips and apostolic work in depressed areas and eventually took part in the EDSA Revolt (Casumpang 2015). Since its founding year in 1985, its repertoire has consisted of original Filipino plays in the vernacular. Tanghalang Ateneo, established earlier in the 1970s, already incorporated original Filipino plays in its repertoire as early as 1979 and became a venue for playwrights like Bienvenido Noriega, Paul Dumol, and <a href=\"/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a>. At the University of Santo Tomas (UST), <a href=\"/7/60/2749\">Artistang Artlets</a> was established in 1980. Together with Teatro Tomasino, which was formed in 1977, this new theater group championed local plays and playwrights, mostly contemporary. After 1986, new texts from <a href=\"/4/4/4498\">Jun Lana</a>, <a href=\"/9/80/5526\">Vim Nadera</a>, and <a href=\"/7/7/3325\">Jose Victor Torres</a> emerged from these groups. Meanwhile, De La Salle Dramatics Guild, already mounting Pilipino translations, adaptations of Western classics, and even original works, managed to survive until 1987 when it officially became DLSU Harlequin Theatre Guild. Both the <a href=\"/7/7/2932\">FEU Drama Guild</a> and the <a href=\"/7/7/3333\">UE Theater Company</a> took a little longer to rebuild and regain active status."

As far back as 1971, RPN was lectured in drama classes in the universities, and afterward in theater groups like Babaylan, PETA, in the Mindanao theater networks, and in the CITASA summer workshops where it served as the opening plenary orientation lecture. Later, when the Orientation-Artistic-Organizational (OAO) framework was incorporated in the PETA theater syllabus in 1978 (Samson et al. 2008, 210-14), RPN fit perfectly in the first frame. The OAO framework was not imposed, but evolved with theater artists. Generally, a Marxist view of reality dominated."

A foreign observer labeled the movement as a &#x201C;playful revolution,&#x201D; affirming the presence and force of the national theater community not only in toppling the dictatorship but also in building and shaping a society (Erven 1992). There was never a final victory for the nationalist, radical, and revolutionary agenda, which marked theater before and during martial law.

They took bits of seditious plays and the theater artist-heroes&#x2019; lives as core or takeoff materials for contemporary playwriting as seen in two 1983 productions: <strong><em>Tolentino!</em></strong> by Edgar Maranan, staged by Bulwagang Gantimpala, and <strong><em>Isang Rihersal</em></strong> (A Rehearsal) by <a href=\"/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a> for PETA. <a href=\"/4/26/4496\">Joel Lamangan</a> did it with <strong><em>Isang Rehersal</em></strong>, and Chris Millado would bring Tolentino closer to the NPA period and the national democratic movement in his <strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong>, PETA, 1991."

An early example of a realist style for this period, both in the mounting and the script, is Orlando Nadres&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/642\"><strong>Paraisong Parisukat</strong></a></em></strong> (Square Eden), 1974, which had one setting for all scenes, capturing the specific ambience of a cramped stockroom above a shoe store space in real life. As conceived in the play&#x2019;s script, the set, the costumes, and the acting would be realistic. Nadres, though, never seemed to have fully incorporated in his fictive creations the social complexities of the period, but this would turn out to become the paramount preoccupation of the younger generation of writers composed of Nonilon Quea&#xF1;o, Bonifacio Ilagan, and Rene O. Villanueva. While maintaining the verisimilitude of settings and accompanying action on stages, their brand of realism underlined concerns for social analysis and the depiction of social realities. More than a mounting style in theater as seen in the sets, costumes, and the execution, realism became an obligation for writers to analyze their society and depict them on stage. Class issues and antagonisms were among the first to surface. Workers&#x2019; issues, along with the conflict between capitalist and labor, had earlier been confronted in Bonifacio Ilagan and Panday Sining&#x2019;s <strong><em><strong><strong><a href=\"/7/58/689\"><strong>Welga! Welga!</strong></a></strong></strong></em></strong> (Strike! Strike!), staged first on 25 Jan 1972 and remounted in 1986."

It problematized a soldier&#x2019;s involvement in the oppressive military operations of the regime. Three years after, Chris Millado&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/526\"><strong>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</strong></a></em></strong> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major), 1985, took the analysis to a more summative and national scale, representing the experiences and points of views on martial law of peasants, workers, the religious, the studentry, the affluent class, the ethnic minority, and even the police force, with all equally condemning the oppressive regime. In 1983, Bienvenido Noriega&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/514\"><strong>Batang Pro</strong></a></em></strong> (Child Prostitutes) appeared, showing how even children suffer mercilessly as sex tourism proliferated during the period."

Issues on the Filipino diaspora and the travails of the overseas Filipino were tackled in <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/516\"><strong>Bayan-bayanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Little Country), 1975, while the elderly became the focus in <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/558\"><strong>Hiblang Abo</strong></a></em></strong> (Strands of Grey), 1980."

				"value": "<strong><strong>Epic</strong> Theater</strong>. The reaction to authoritarian rule broadened the existing vocabulary of theater. Politicized Filipino artists and critics continuously seeking alternative ways to wrestle with artistic creations in settings that had grown far more complex and demanding, rediscovered Brecht and his practice. Challenged by the art and theoretical formulations of the master, certain features of playwriting and productions were identified as Brechtian or epic theater or theater of instruction, such as the nonconventional presentational style employing mime, song, and dance. The use of slides and other technical innovations, and the stylization of costumes and sets were also explored. Folklore and history were tapped as sources for characters and narratives (Torres-Reyes 1994, 71). Al Santos&#x2019;s use of life-size dummies as substitute for real actors for the torture scenes in his <strong><em>Mene, Mene Tekel Upharsin</em></strong> (Your Days Are Numbered), 1982, and Chris Millado&#x2019;s use of mask in his <a href=\"/7/58/562\"><strong><em>Ilokula</em></strong></a> productions, 1983, would fit the category, as would some Bonifacio Ilagan and Behn Cervantes collaborations."

To a certain degree during this period, Brechtian theater, people&#x2019;s theater, and activists&#x2019; theater overlapped. Brechtian also generally connoted a nonrealist style of theater mounting. Some critics and commentators saw in Rolando Tinio&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/605\"><strong>May Katwiran ang Katwiran</strong></a></em></strong> (Reason Has Its Reason) and Paul Dumol&#x2019;s <strong><em>Kabesang Tales</em></strong> and <a href=\"/7/58/635\"><strong><em>Ang</em></strong> </a><em><a href=\"/7/58/635\"><strong>Paglilitis ni Mang Serapio</strong></a> </em>(The Trial of Old Serapio) techniques and devices learned from Brecht."

The use of slides in theater productions to project photos taken from real events, approximating news coverage or newspaper accounts, is one innovation characteristic of the documentary theater or style. Al Santos&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/607\"><strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno Atbp. Kabanata</em></strong></a> (May 21 and Other Chapters), 1977, added to this technology the use of narrators for an overall narrative effect, projecting what was happening on stage as historically accurate or nonfiction. The play covered historical vignettes from the Spanish period to the American, the Japanese, and then the present. Joel Lamangan&#x2019;s direction of <strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno</em></strong> used recycled newspaper and magazine photos of the<em>kapatiran</em>Lapiang Malaya and its leader Valentin de los Santos, particularly the massacre that transpired on that date. Lamangan would reprise this style in his <strong><em>Bien Aligtad</em></strong>, 1983."

It also used slides of actual establishments and places where the trade flourished. The whole cast and crew actually developed the play. About 15 PETA actors conducted visits to these establishments, and observed and interviewed prostitutes. In the actual production, an offstage voice throwing questions to the characters onstage served as narrative frame and sequence guide, and the whole production appeared like an interview session with prostitutes, serving as a documentation of their lives and trade."

Theater during martial law contributed one original genre to the rich tapestry of modern Philippine theater forms&#x2014;the <a href=\"/7/55/481\"><strong>tula-dula</strong></a>. This is credited to the UP Repertory Company. A performance designed for mass actions and rallies, it features a narrator, who delivers the lines of the poem, and one or two movers miming the action of characters in the poem. The narrator generally uses a microphone or a megaphone for the huge audience to hear the play. The first tula-dula used a previously written poem, <a href=\"/9/80/5429\">Jose Lacaba</a>&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href=\"/7/58/611\">Ang mga Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan de la Cruz</a>&#x201D; (The Amazing Adventures of Juan de la Cruz) for the performance. Eventually other poems were seen as good material for tula-dula mountings like Richie Valencia and Ed Vencio&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/569\"><strong><em>Mga Unang Araw sa Buhay ng <strong>Iskolar ng Bayan</strong></em></strong></a> (First Few Days in the Life of a New Scholar of the People), 1976, which gave birth to the character Isko, the student in the state university. After its initial employment in 1975, the form developed and had many variations, and poems would be specifically written for stage mounting (Dacanay 2009) such as <a href=\"/7/58/680\"><strong><em><strong>Titser</strong> ng Bayan</em></strong></a> (People&#x2019;s Teacher), which was performed from the late 1970s to the early 1980s."

The 1983 PETA production <a href=\"/7/58/626\"><em><strong>Nukleyar</strong>!</em></a> (Nuclear!) embodied a loosely strung rock band concert, with the singing accompanied by dancing and dramatic improvisations. Without a definite narrative spine, it projected a more issue-oriented production that highlighted the dangers confronting the Philippines with the Bataan nuclear power plant project. Similarly incorporating music, choreography, and dramatic scenes together, but with clearer and more solid narratives were Gines Tan&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/5/40/935\"><strong>Magsimula Ka</strong></a></em></strong> (Make a Start), 1983, which was about fresh graduates pursuing dreams in spite of parental control, and Dong de los Reyes&#x2019;s <strong><em>Bien Aligtad</em></strong>, 1985, which focused on the effects of militarization on slum dwellers. Theater artists from Mindanao explored this form as well. Tapping into the region&#x2019;s rich culture, they came up with <strong><em>Maranatha</em></strong>, 1974, <strong><em><strong>Halik sa Kampilan</strong></em></strong>, 1978, <strong><em>Ranaw: Isang Alamat</em></strong> (Ranaw: A Legend), 1985, and <strong><em>Sinalimba</em></strong>, 1986, which all incorporated local music, costume, and dances into the narrative (Tiongson 1994b, 29)."

Before its imposition, a relatively good segment of that community had already become radicalized and had already succeeded in forming influential theater groups and networks, particularly in the National Capital Region, but eventually also in the regions. The vanguards and trainees of this advance force eventually reestablished their links and influence in the community when the imposition happened and remarkably led the community to a good fight and a good harvest. Some groups had more participation than others in this undertaking, some individuals were more prominent in battle, but the theater community was generally against martial rule."

The regions too fought, with very strong currents in Mindanao, Negros, and Bicol generally following Manila&#x2019;s compass and trends. But it was also during this period that playwrights developed original works using indigenous languages, lore, narratives, themes, and issues. Viewed as solidifying and enriching the cultural component of nation building, these works could be seen as the period&#x2019;s gain. The harvest to date still needs thorough documentation and publication. But enough material exists, already seen in subsequent productions or publications, even if so much data and artifacts, including texts, still have to be retrieved."

Immersion in social and political realities, including the reality that was the dictatorship and its oppressive character, unleashed the talent and resources of theater artists, individually and collectively. It certainly broadened the vocabulary of styles, trends, and forms of theater in the country. And with the success of the people&#x2019;s theater, the MAKIISA events, as well as earlier achievements that reached national proportions, Philippine theater rooted in indigenous culture, enriched by outside influences, and conscious of the Filipino people it serves, prevailed. <span class>&#xA0;</span> "

This did not mean, however, that artists stopped creating or staging works about current events. Theater artists continued to revive old works and create new plays or <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a> that criticized, satirized, or shed new light on societal ills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, in the months following the EDSA Revolt, theater artists promptly mounted productions in response to this new chapter in the country&rsquo;s history. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a>&rsquo;s (PETA) <strong><em>Panata sa</em></strong> <em><strong><strong><strong>Kala</strong></strong>yaan</strong> </em>(Oath to Freedom), a compendium of stories about the Filipino people during the Marcos regime, was staged at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>. The fact that a group like PETA was able to perform at the CCP was a symbolic &ldquo;takeover&rdquo; of the center in that the latter had previously shut out local groups and critical works in favor of foreign acts and what were perceived to be &ldquo;high art&rdquo; productions. <strong><em>Panata</em></strong> was one of the first productions to be staged after martial law and went on to tour in North America, Europe, and Asia, thereby introducing contemporary Philippine theater to international audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that year, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a> staged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3127\">Bienvenido Noriega</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bongbong at Kris</em></strong> (Bongbong and Kris) also at the CCP. The third prize winner of that year&rsquo;s CCP Playwriting Contest, the satire is an imagined romance between deposed Marcos&rsquo;s son Bongbong and the new president Corazon Aquino&rsquo;s daughter Kris, signaling in a way that it was all right to start laughing again. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines (Rep)</a> staged <strong><em>Evita</em></strong>, the musical based on the life of Eva Peron, previously banned in the country as its story line had uncanny parallelisms with Imelda Marcos. In the regions, Negros Theatre League started staging productions that aimed to show that nothing had changed despite having a new government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1989, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3235\">Lea Salonga</a> and several other Filipino theater actors were cast in the mega-musical <strong><em>Miss Saigon</em></strong> at London&rsquo;s West End. Salonga was later cast in the Broadway staging as well. Publicity for the show highlighted Filipino talent: there were anecdotes of how the producers searched all over the world to find the perfect actors for the roles only to find what they needed in the Philippines. This resulted in increased media exposure for Philippine theater, creating more awareness of Filipino talent among international audiences as well as among the Filipino public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The restoration of democracy eventually led to social and economic development&mdash;factors that helped spur growth for the country and, as a result, in the theater scene as well. In the decades following 1986, new Filipino plays and musicals in Filipino and other Philippine languages, as well as in English, were created and staged. Theater programs in the academe and theater companies, professional and otherwise, provided more and more opportunities for artists to perform a variety of genres and materials. New companies and groups were formed, new performance spaces were built, audience numbers grew, and interest in the theater arts was nurtured.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"institutions\" name=\"institutions\"></a>Institutions and Groups</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Government Organizations</strong>. After 1986, public and private institutions and organizations went through reorganization or were established, reflecting a renewed and growing interest in Philippine arts. These groups have helped steer the direction of Philippine theater these past few decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Cultural Center of the Philippines reevaluated its mandate under Ma. Teresa Escoda-Roxas and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>, whose leadership from 1986 to 1994 envisioned the creation of a national culture, focusing on four main points: Filipinization&mdash;that is, prioritizing Filipino works over foreign acts and emphasizing the staging of new Filipino works; democratization or reaching out to all socioeconomic strata and sectors and not just the elite audiences of the martial law years, and allowing more groups and artists to use CCP venues and resources; decentralization, which means rallying all regions and sectors to showcase their own cultures and contribute to the creation of a national Filipino culture; and reorientation of international exchanges to showcase Filipino artists abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From simply being a venue for performances, CCP transformed into the national coordinating center for the arts. To foster pride in the rich heritage of Filipino artistry, CCP renamed its venues and surrounding streets after Filipino artists. The Main Theater was named Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a> in honor of the composer; the Little Theater, Tanghalang <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a> after the playwright and director; and the Bulwagang Gantimpala, Tanghalang Huseng Batute, the pen name of poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>. A street was named after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> playwright <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5707\">Vicente Sotto</a>. CCP also revived the National Artist awards. Theater artists who have received this honor since then include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang dela Rama</a>, 1987; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a> (posthumous), 1997; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a> (posthumous), 1997; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2991\">Daisy Avellana</a>, 1999; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a> (posthumous), 2001; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a>, 2003.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of the center&rsquo;s decentralization efforts, the CCP established arts councils in the regions, developed satellite venues in select cities all over the country, created nationwide events and festivals, and through its Outreach and Exchange Department, organized nationwide tours of performances from Manila to the regions and vice versa. Plays such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>&rsquo;s (TP) <strong><em>Mac Malicsi</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tonyo, Pepe at Pule</em></strong> (Tonyo, Pepe, and Pule) were toured in the regions while shows like Marawi-based <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/554\"><strong><em><strong>Halik</strong> sa Kampilan</em></strong></a> (Kiss on the Sword) was brought to Manila, Vigan, Laoag, Baguio, Pampanga, Batangas, and Sorsogon. TP was also sent to Paris in 1994 to perform the <strong><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a>&nbsp;</strong><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></em></strong> (Orosman and Zafira).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CCP created the National Theater Festival, gathering theater practitioners from across the country to showcase their best works and network with each other. The first festival, titled &ldquo;Unang Tagpo&rdquo; (First Scene), was held in 1992. This was followed by &ldquo;Ikalawang Tagpo&rdquo; (Second Scene), 1996, and &ldquo;Ikatlong Tagpo&rdquo; (Third Scene), 2004. The festival held in 2012, billed &ldquo;Ikaapat na Tagpo: Ang Bagong Yugto&rdquo; (Fourth Scene: The New Act), included groups from the regions such as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3004\">Integrated Performing Arts Guild</a> of Mindanano State University&ndash;Iligan Institute of Technology, <strong><em>Uwahig</em></strong> (Mindanao Flood Story); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3109\">Kabpapagariya Ensemble</a> of Mindanao State University&ndash;General Santos City, <strong><em>Dula Ta</em></strong> (Let&rsquo;s Play); The Xavier Stage of Cagayan de Oro, <strong><em>Isa Pang Kawing</em></strong> (One More Link); Bohol Antequera, Maribojoc Cultural Collective, Teatro Bol-Anon from Bohol, <strong><em>Duha Ka Alimpo sa Habagat</em></strong> (Two Eyes of the Monsoon Storm); Kanlaon Theater Guild of Colegio San Agustin&ndash;Bacolod, <strong><em>Circulo</em></strong>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation</a> from Bulacan, which staged <strong><em>Kakarong: The <strong>Musical</strong></em></strong>; as well as National Capital Region-based groups <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP)</a> of the University of the Philippines (UP), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong></a> (Orosman and Zafira); <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a> of Ateneo de Manila University, <strong><em>Sintang Dalisay</em></strong> (Pure Love); PETA, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a></em></strong>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Gantimpala Theater Foundation</a>, <strong><em>Sayaw ng mga Senyorita</em></strong> (Dance of the Maidens); Tanghalang Pilipino, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/670\"><strong>Stageshow</strong></a></em></strong>; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3328\">Triumphant People&rsquo;s Evangelistic Theater Society (Trumpets)</a>, <strong><em>Mind&rsquo;s Eye</em></strong>; Sipat Lawin Ensemble, <strong><em>Battalia Royale</em></strong> (Battle Royale) and <strong><em>Haring Tubul</em></strong>, an adaptation of <strong><em>Ubu Roi</em></strong>; Silly People&rsquo;s Improv Theater, <strong><em>D4: The Next Generation</em></strong>; and ventriloquists Ony Carcamo and Wanlu, <strong><em>Bata Batute</em></strong> (Child Batute).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using an earlier proposal from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a>, CCP helped prepare the proposal for a ministry of culture, which became the basis for the Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts (PCCA) created by Executive Order 118 in 1987, and later, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, created via Republic Act 7356, which replaced the PCCA in 1992.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The NCCA makes cultural policies, coordinates and gives grants for the preservation, development, and promotion of Philippine arts and culture, and administers the National Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts. Through its National Committee on Dramatic Arts, it has given grants to theater productions, conferences, and workshops, and established Tanghal: The National University and College Theater Festival in 2007. Tanghal has since been a gathering of youth theater groups based in colleges and universities who interact with each other, exchange ideas and processes, and showcase outstanding works. It was held at the University of San Agustin, Iloilo, in 2007; West Mindanao State University, Zamboanga, 2008; Colegio de San Juan de Letran, Laguna, 2009; in various venues in Manila, 2010; and University of St. La Salle, Bacolod, 2011. In 2012, the festival was held in four sites: Benguet State University for Luzon; Siliman University, Dumaguete, for the Visayas; Mindanao State University, General Santos City, for Mindanao; and Polytechnic University of the Philippines for the National Capital Region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Artist Networks and Alliances</strong>. In 1989, under the guidance of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a> and coordinator <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2884\">Charley de la Paz</a>, Writer&rsquo;s Bloc was formed to provide PETA&rsquo;s in-house writers support for their playwriting, through feedback sessions and workshops to rehearsals and marketing assistance. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a> became executive director after De la Paz&rsquo;s death in 1995. The group organized and hosted the first National Playwrights Conference in 1997 and held the annual Dulaang Laboratoryo Festival with PETA from 1998 to 2007. In 2004, Writer&rsquo;s Bloc became an independent group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1994, Salvador Bernal formed the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3168\">Philippine Association of Theatre Designers and Technicians (PATDAT)</a>, the Philippine chapter of the International Organisation of Scenographers, Theatre Architects and Technicians, more popularly known by its French name&rsquo;s acronym OISTAT (Organisation Internationale des Sc&eacute;nographes, Techniciens et Architectes de Th&eacute;atre). Bernal served as PATDAT president until his death in 2011, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3211\">Leo Rialp</a> succeeded him. PATDAT has sent representatives to international production design exhibitions such as the World Stage Design 2005 in Toronto, Canada, featuring <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2746\">Joaquin Jose Aranda</a>&rsquo;s 2001 lighting design for <strong><em>Turn Up the Quiet, Just Dance</em></strong>, which was a jury selection for exhibition, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2973\">Gino Gonzales</a>&rsquo;s set design for <strong><em>Spolarium</em></strong>, 2003, which won the silver prize; and the World Stage Design 2009 in Seoul, Korea, featuring the winning sound designs of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3886\">Jed Balsamo</a> for <strong><em>Amihan</em></strong>, 2008, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3011\">Jethro Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s for <strong><em>Hamlet</em></strong>, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1997, Alyansa ng mga Manggagawang Pangkultura sa Kamaynilaan at mga Karatig-Pook Inc was formed. This group is a network of individual artists and groups, high school and college students, out-of-school youth, church workers, teachers, industrial workers, and freelance artists from Metro Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same year, heads of different theater groups in Metro Manila came together to form <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3170\">Philippine Legitimate Stage Artists Group (Philstage)</a>, the country&rsquo;s only organization of professional performing arts companies.

To celebrate the 1998 Philippine Centennial, it produced Buhay! (Live!), a theater festival of 100 performances in Shangri-La Plaza Mall. Together with the NCCA, it created a theater appreciation program that ran from 2000 to 2004, which offered free viewing of plays, musicals, and dance performances to public school students and teachers. In 2008, it formed Gawad Buhay! to celebrate excellence in productions staged by its member companies. The first awarding ceremony was held in 2009, honoring productions done in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Networks in the regions were also formed. In 1987, the Philippine Coordinating Council for People&rsquo;s Cultures (Bugkos) was established. A network of some 200 cultural groups involved in theater, literature, dance, music, and visual arts nationwide, Bugkos has its national secretariat in Metro Manila and has networks in different regions: TADEC in the Cordillera, BUSLO in Central Luzon, SINING in Metro Manila, Makabayang Alyansa sa Sining Anakpawis&ndash;Timog Katagalugan in Southern Tagalog, Kaborongan in Bicol, and Mindanao Community Theatre Network and Mindanao Center for People&rsquo;s Culture in Mindanao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Luzon, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2751\">Arts Research and Training Institute in Southern Tagalog Inc (ARTIST Inc)</a> was established in Laguna in 1987 by sectoral groups and community-based organizations in Southern Tagalog. The network aims to provide opportunities to conduct arts trainings and cultural research for their productions.

Filipino theater groups have been established abroad. Notably, the theater artists involved in the founding of three Filipino-American theater groups are Filipino immigrants who mostly have had training with PETA or the University of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ma-Yi Theater Company was formed in New York in 1989, with Chito Jao Garces as founding artistic director, followed by Ralph Pe&ntilde;a in 1995.

The company won the 2010 Drama Desk Award for Theater Excellence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In San Francisco, Teatro ng Tanan (TnT) was established in 1988 by a group of immigrant theater artists, with the help of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\">Chris Millado</a>. It produced original plays focusing on immigrant experiences and had outreach performances for low-income audiences such as Filipino World War II veterans. The group was active until 2001.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1993, stand-up comic Al Manalo, with other Filipino-American comedians, created the sketch comedy group <strong><em>Tongue in a Mood</em></strong>. In 1997, Manalo included actors from TnT for its first major production at Bindlestiff Studio, a black box arts space and theater venue he discovered when he watched a one-woman play by Lorna Aquino Chui-Velasco, an actress who had trained at Bindlestiff as a teenager. Manalo and his wife Joyce Juan took over the management of the studio in 1998, developing its programming to nurture and celebrate Filipino-American performing artists. Since then, Bindlestiff Studio has produced original plays, music festivals, stand-up and sketch comedy shows, dance, visual and video arts all created by Filipino Americans. Their productions include the <strong><em>PiNoise <strong>Pop Music</strong> Festival</em></strong>, the <strong><em>FOB Show</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Bakla Show</em></strong> (Gay Show), the <strong><em>Love Edition</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Stories High</em></strong>, a culmination of acting, writing, and directing workshops offered each season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Chicago, CIRCA Pintig theater group was founded in 1991. Initially as Pintig Cultural Group, it mounted <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1688\"><strong>America Is in the Heart</strong></a></em></strong> for its inaugural production.

It became a theater group&mdash;the Carlos Bulosan Theater&mdash;in 1984. It has staged productions such as <strong><em>Cardin</em></strong>, <strong><em>If My Mother Could See Me Now/Inay Kung Alam Mo Lang</em></strong>, <strong><em>Home Sweet Home</em></strong>, <strong><em>Images of 1896</em></strong>, and <strong><em>The Romance of Magno Rubio</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"education\" name=\"education\"></a>Education and Training</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater as a college degree has been offered by UP&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2899\">Department of Speech Communication and Theater Arts</a> since the mid-1970s. In the 1990s, it started offering a certificate program in theater. Schools that began to offer theater-related courses after 1986 include Polytechnic University of the Philippines, with its bachelor of arts in theater arts; De La Salle&ndash;College of Saint Benilde, with its technical theater and production design courses; Ateneo de Manila University, with its bachelor of fine arts, major in theater arts, with concentrations in acting, directing, technical theater, drama text and performance, and theater history and criticism; and Meridian International College (Mint College), with its bachelor of arts in theater arts. The Philippine High School for the Arts, established in 1978 via Presidential Decree 1287, continues to offer arts-focused secondary education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater artists and scholars continue to travel to other countries to study directing, acting, playwriting, and other disciplines, some taking short courses or workshops and some obtaining college, masteral, or doctoral degrees. Some of these artists do so under scholarships or grants from organizations such as the Philippine-American Educational Foundation, the Fulbright Program, Japan Foundation, and the Asian Cultural Council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the artists who have studied abroad after 1986 include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2999\">Mio Infante</a>, Wimbledon School of Art for set design/production design/scenography; Clint Ramos, New York University (NYU); Gino Gonzales, NYU; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2925\">Josefina Estrella</a> for directing, Columbia University; Chris Millado for performance studies, NYU; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3087\">Glenn Sevilla Mas</a> for playwriting, Catholic University of America; Barbara Tan-Tiongco for technical theater, Yale University; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3053\">Ana Valdez Lim</a> for acting, Juilliard School; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3078\">Missy Maramara</a> for performance, University of Arkansas.

PETA is distinct in that it is the only company, thus far, that has been able to own its land and building in Quezon City starting 2005, after it moved out of its original venue, Dulaang Rajah Sulayman, a former Spanish garrison in Intramuros, Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many venues commonly used by theater companies in Metro Manila. In Manila, there are the Philamlife Auditorium, and Manila <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> or Tanghalang Pangkalakhan ng Maynila until it closed in 1996; in Pasay, Aliw Theater and Star Theater; Rizal Theater at the Makati Commercial Center until it was demolished in 1991, Onstage Theater at the Greenbelt 1 Mall, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5659\">Carlos P.

Traditional and classic theater forms, such as the komedya, sinakulo, and sarsuwela, continue to be staged in the regions and in urban settings such as Metro Manila. New groups that stage these classic forms continue to be established as new works continue to be created as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The komedya continues to find new incarnations. In 1992, Komedya ng San Dionisio was invited to attend workshops at the CCP to update this traditional form by writing new works using the community&rsquo;s aesthetic standards; using relevant themes to replace the theme of Muslim conversion to Christianity; modernizing the form by tightening plots; and preserving characteristic features such as verse, choreography, and conventional romantic, spectacular, and epic elements (Fernandez 2004, 71-73).

In 2007, Jerry Respeto directed Rene Villanueva&rsquo;s modern komedya <strong><em>Sandaang Panaginip</em></strong> (A Hundred Dreams), an allegory of the Marcos family first staged in 1981 for ENTABLADO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, at the <strong><em>Komedya Fiesta</em></strong>, Komedya ng San Dionisio and Komedya ng Don Galo, both from Para&ntilde;aque City, staged Max Allanigue&rsquo;s <strong><em>Prinsipe Rodante</em></strong> (Prince Rodante); Comedia de Baler from Baler, Aurora, in Northern Luzon performed Isabelita Mejia&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sakim na Pagmamahal</em></strong> (Greedy Love); Komedya San Miguel from Iligan City, Lanao del Norte, staged Ramon and Damaso Padilla&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kinabuhi ni Senyor San Miguel</em></strong> (Life of Saint Michael); and DUP staged Sir Anril Tiatco&rsquo;s adaptation of <strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong> (Orosman and Zafira).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Los Angeles, USA, San Dionisio sa America was established in the late 1990s by families originally from San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque City.

The Sariaya Dramatic Guild in Sariaya, Quezon, has performed <strong><em>Santo Kristo: Isang Senakulo</em></strong> (Holy Christ: A Passion Play) since 1904. Sinakulo have been held in several barrios in Malolos, Bulacan, since the 1910s and in San Pedro Cutud, San Fernando, Pampanga, since the 1950s. <strong><em>Ang Pagtaltal sa Balaan Bukid</em></strong> (The Passion of Christ at the Holy Mountain) has been staged in Jordan, Guimaras, since 1975. In Metro Manila, sinakulo have been performed since 1902 in different barangays such as in Malibay, Pasay; in Cainta, Rizal, by Krus sa Nayon Incorporated since 1904 and by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3236\">Samahang Nazareno</a> since 1960; and in Mandaluyong by Samahang Kabataan ng San Roque Senakulista ng Barangka since 1965.

From 1986 to the mid-1990s, the local government of Silay and the Silay City Arts Foundation sponsored an annual sarsuwela competition. In 1994, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3279\">Tambayo Cultural Group</a> staged a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a> sarsuwela titled <strong><em>Sirena: Pangasinan Myths and Legends in Lingayen</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting 1987, Tanghalang Pilipino, following the CCP&rsquo;s directive of revitalizing traditional forms, has revived and staged existing sarsuwela such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), 1987; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a></em></strong> (After the Darkness), 1989; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (No Wounds), 1994; and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/650\"><strong>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</strong></a></em></strong> (At the Mercy of Sharks), 1995. It also staged new sarsuwela like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907) by Nicanor Tiongson, music by Lutgardo Labad, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3051\">Lucien Letaba</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3156\">Louie Pascasio</a> in 1992, 1993, and 2007. This last play was premiered by PETA in 1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1998, the National Centennial Commission hosted the Centennial Literary Prize. First prize winner for the sarsuwela category was Mario O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/639\"><strong>Palasyo ni Valentin</strong></a></em></strong> (Palace of Valentin), music by Minda Azarcon, staged by PETA that same year. There was a three-way tie for second prize: George de Jesus&rsquo;s <strong><em>Paglayang Minamahal</em></strong> (Beloved Freedom), music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4517\">Jesse Lucas</a>, staged by Tanghalang Pilipino in 2000; Bienvenido Lumbera&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/557\"><strong>Hibik at Himagsik nina Victoria Laktaw Atbp.</strong></a></em></strong> (Plea and Revolt of Victoria Laktaw and Others), music by Lucien Letaba, staged by DUP in 2002; and Melba Padilla Maggay&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bayan, Isang Paa na Lamang</em></strong> (Nation: Just One Foot Left), music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4162\">Lucio San Pedro</a>, staged by Institute for Studies in Asian Church and Culture in 2002.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other new sarsuwela include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5653\">Alejandro Roces</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Something to Crow About</em></strong>, 2006, based on his short story &ldquo;My Brother&rsquo;s Peculiar Chicken,&rdquo; staged in Manila, 2006, and in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, 2007; Nicanor G.

In 2010, the University of the East Drama Company staged <strong><em>Miss Philippines</em></strong> for Tanghal, the NCCA-organized National University and College Theater Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Western-Type Musicals</strong>. Filipino theater groups continue to stage classics and produce new works in the musical genre, combining influences from the traditional musical forms of sarsuwela, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> (indigenized vaudeville), and&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">kundiman</a>&nbsp;</em>(classic love songs) even as they adopt and adapt new and developing forms, devices, and trends from around the world such as musicals, sung-through musicals, rock operas, and mega-musicals. PETA and Tanghalang Pilipino stage original musicals as part of their season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History and its heroes always serve as inspirational subject matter for musicals. PETA staged <strong><em>1896: The Musicale</em></strong>, 1995, a narrative about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5393\">Emilio Jacinto</a>, to commemorate the centennial of the Filipino&rsquo;s revolt against colonial Spain. Musicat staged <strong><em>Alikabok</em></strong> (Dust), 1995, a play about the Katipunera Bising Vallejo. DUP staged <strong><em>Gabriela</em></strong>, 2005, which is about Gabriela Silang. TP staged <strong><em>Aguinaldo 1899: Ang Pagpatay kay Luna</em></strong> (Aguinaldo 1899: The Murder of Luna), 1998, which is about Emilio Aguinaldo; <strong><em>EJ: Ang Pinagdaanang Buhay nina Evelio Javier at Edgar Jopson</em></strong> (EJ: The Lives of Evelio Javier and Edgar Jopson), 2008, a <strong>jukebox musical</strong> about martial law activists Javier and Jopson that uses songs by the rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\">The Dawn</a>; <strong><em>San Andres B</em></strong>, 2013, which is about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>; and <strong><em>Mabining Mandirigma</em></strong> (Gentle Warrior), 2015, which centers on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1196\">Jose Rizal</a> and his novels also provide inspiration for theatrical works. DUP, for instance, staged <strong><em>Elias at <strong>Salome</strong></em></strong> (Elias and Salome), 1996, while TP staged <strong><em>Noli Me Tangere</em></strong>, <strong><em>El Filibusterismo</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Ilustrado: Ang Buhay ni Rizal</em></strong> (Educated Native: The Life of Rizal). Musicat produced <strong><em>Sino Ka Ba, Jose Rizal?</em></strong> (Who Are You, Jose Rizal?), 1996.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippine literature originally written in English has inspired adaptations such as TP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Florante at Laura</em></strong> (Florante and Laura), 1988, and <strong><em><strong>Banaag at Sikat</strong></em></strong> (Glimmer and Light), 2010, a rock musical based on the novel by <strong><strong><strong><strong>Lope K. Santos</strong></strong></strong></strong>; Musicat&rsquo;s <strong><em>Larawan</em></strong> (Portrait), 1997, based on Nick Joaquin&rsquo;s play <strong><em><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></em></strong>, and <strong><em>Fire Water Woman</em></strong>, 2000, based on Joaquin&rsquo;s play <strong><em>Tatarin: A Witches&rsquo; Sabbath in Three Acts</em></strong> and on his short story &ldquo;The Summer Solstice.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pop culture reflected in film and<em>komiks</em>have also provided inspiration for musical adaptations. TP staged <strong><em>Himala: The Musical</em></strong>, 2000, based on the film of the same title, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/692\"><strong>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Muzikal</strong></a></em></strong>, 2006, based on the graphic novel, also of the same title. Musicat staged <strong><em><strong>Kenkoy</strong> Loves Rosing</em></strong>, 1992, based on the komiks version. Bit by Bit Productions staged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/602\"><strong><em>Maxie: The Musical</em></strong></a>, 2005, based on the film <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1257\"><strong><em><strong>Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo <strong>Oliver</strong>os</strong></em></strong></a> (<strong><em>The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros</em></strong>). Viva Productions and Full House Theater Company has staged <strong><em>Bituing Walang Ningning</em></strong> (Star without Sparkle), 2015, based on the film and komiks version of the same title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musicals range from revivals of older musical genres to new and emerging forms. <strong>Bodabil</strong> tunes have been revisited in such musicals as Musicat&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/581\"><strong><em>Katy!</em></strong></a>, 1988, and TP&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/670\"><strong><em>Stageshow</em></strong></a>, 2012. But rap has also been used to comment on corruption as in TP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kleptomaniacs</em></strong>, 2014. PETA has staged musicals that talk about current events and issues, like <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/667\"><strong>Skin Deep</strong></a></em></strong>, 2008, a dark comedy on the cosmetic surgery industry, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/529\"><strong>Care Divas</strong></a></em></strong>, 2010, a play about a group of overseas Filipino workers who moonlight as cross-dressing performers. It has also staged <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/647\"><strong><em>Rak of <strong><strong>Aegis</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, 2014, a jukebox musical using songs by rock band <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\">Aegis</a> that touches on the hopes and frustrations of families in a fictitious barangay dealing with constant flooding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Musicals with religious themes have also been staged. <strong><em>Magnificat</em></strong>, about the life of Jesus Christ as seen through the eyes of his mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, written by Nestor Torre with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>, was staged from 1996 to 2012. Trumpets has produced evangelical musicals in English such as <strong><em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em></strong>, 1997; <strong><em>The Little Mermaid</em></strong>, 2000; <strong><em>N.O.A.H. (No Ordinary Aquatic Habitat)</em></strong>, 2009; and <strong><em>Bluebird of Happiness</em></strong>, 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pulse, emotions, and music of the streets also provide inspiration for performances. Teatro Pabrika, for instance, integrates songs in union meetings and picket lines or mounts productions advocating better working conditions for workers such as <strong><em><strong><strong>Harana</strong></strong>ng Bayan I</em></strong> (Serenade for the Nation I), 1991, <strong><em>Haranang Bayan II</em></strong> (Serenade for the Nation II), 1992, <strong><em>Kuwatro Kantos</em></strong> (Four Corners), 1995, and <strong><em>Ultimatum</em></strong>, 1998.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep and Atlantis are the most consistent in staging foreign musicals, usually from the United States and the United Kingdom. In the late 1980s, Repertory Philippines (Rep) did <strong><em>Evita</em></strong>, <strong><em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em></strong>, <strong><em>Little Shop of <strong>Horror</strong>s</em></strong>, <strong><em>Man of La Mancha</em></strong>, <strong><em>Nunsense</em></strong>, <strong><em>La Cage Aux Folles</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Kismet</em></strong>; in the1990s, <strong><em>Scrooge</em></strong>, <strong><em>The King and I</em></strong>, <strong><em>Grease</em></strong>, <strong><em>Fiddler on the Roof</em></strong>, <strong><em>Into the Woods</em></strong>, <strong><em>Les Miserables</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Wiz</em></strong>, <strong><em>My Fair Lady</em></strong>, <strong><em>Camelot</em></strong>, <strong><em>Once on This Island</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em></strong>, <strong><em>Carousel</em></strong>, <strong><em>South Pacific</em></strong>, <strong><em>Annie</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Oliver!</em></strong>; in the 2000s, <strong><em>The Secret Garden</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Sound of Music</em></strong>, <strong><em><strong>Altar</strong> Boyz</em></strong>, Disney&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mulan</em></strong>, <strong><em>A Christmas Carol</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Sweeney Todd</em></strong>; and in the 2010s, <strong><em>Little Women</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Wizard of Oz</em></strong>, <strong><em>Disney&rsquo;s Camp Rock: The Musical</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Alice in Wonderland</em></strong>. Atlantis&rsquo;s inaugural production was <strong><em>Rent</em></strong> in 1999. Since then it has staged, in the 2000s, <strong><em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Rocky Horror Show</em></strong>, <strong><em>Dreamgirls</em></strong>, <strong><em>Urinetown</em></strong>, Disney&rsquo;s <strong><em>Beauty and the Beast</em></strong>, <strong><em>Avenue Q</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hairspray</em></strong>, <strong><em>Spring Awakening</em></strong>, <strong><em>and Legally Blonde</em></strong>; in the 2010s, Disney&rsquo;s <strong><em>Little Mermaid</em></strong>, <strong><em>Next to Normal</em></strong>, <strong><em>In the <strong><strong>Heights</strong></strong></em></strong>, <strong><em>Rock of Ages</em></strong>, Disney&rsquo;s <strong><em>Aladdin</em></strong>, <strong><em>Piaf</em></strong>, <strong><em>Carrie</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Addams Family</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ghost: The Musical</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Shrek</em></strong>. Rep and Atlantis have also toured their productions in other Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Jakarta.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1999, SK Productions staged <strong><em>Rama at Sita</em></strong> (Rama and Sita) at the UP Theater. It was a large-scale musical based on the Indian epic <strong><em>Ramayana</em></strong> and was reported to have cost 40 million pesos to produce. From 2000 to 2001, <strong><em>Miss Saigon</em></strong> was staged in Manila, with Lea Salonga and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2732\">Isay Alvarez</a> reprising their roles as Kim and Gigi, respectively, in the musical&rsquo;s 1989 world premiere at the West End. This production took over the usual theater and rehearsal venues of CCP resident companies Tanghalang Pilipino and Ballet Philippines, prompting strong reactions from the local theater community about how a foreign production was displacing local artists. A decade later, production company Concertus Manila produced the Manila run of the international production <strong><em>Cats</em></strong>, 2010, with Salonga as Grizabella, also at the CCP. This began what has become a consistent stream of international productions such as <strong><em>Phantom of the Opera</em></strong>, 2013, <strong><em>Wicked</em></strong>, 2014, and <strong><em>Chicago</em></strong>, 2015, proving that now there is a big enough audience in the Philippines and an economy strong enough to bring in touring productions in Manila, which provide stiff competition for local theater companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Straight Plays</strong>. Original plays continue to be created after 1986. In the 1990s, social and psychological realism in theater became more dominant as audiences became more interested in the characterizations and internal conflicts of characters than in political motifs that dominated the theater scene from 1972 to 1986. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a> wrote plays that touch on middle-class characters dealing with the psychological underpinnings of love and loss such as <strong><em>Saan Ba Tayo Ihahatid ng Disyembre?</em></strong> (Where Will December Bring Us?), staged by PETA, and <strong><em>Oktubre, Noong Tayo&rsquo;y Nagmamahalan Pa</em></strong> (October, When We Were Still in Love) and <strong><em>Nobyembre, Noong Akala Ko&rsquo;y Mahal Kita</em></strong> (November, When I Thought I Love You), staged by TP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, plays about the martial law years and its aftereffects, political activism, and human rights violations such as forced disappearances continued to be staged such as DUP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Desaparecidos</em></strong> (Forced Disappearances); TP&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/596\"><strong>Maliw</strong></a></strong> </em>(Fade),&nbsp;<em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/566\"><strong>Isang Araw sa Karnabal</strong></a></strong> </em>(A Day in the Carnival), and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/526\"><strong>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</strong></a></em></strong> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major); and Atlantis Productions&rsquo; <strong><em><strong>Dogeaters</strong></em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays continued to find inspiration in history such as PETA&rsquo;s <strong><em>Lakangbini</em></strong> (Las Viajeras/Oryang) and <strong><em>Ang Dalawang Buhay ni Plaridel</em></strong> (Almanac for Revolution), which were about Gregoria de Jesus and Marcelo del Pilar, respectively; TP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Paglilitis at Pagkamatay ni Jose Rizal: Mga Teksto at Mga Komentaryo</em></strong> (The Trial and Death of Jose Rizal: Texts and Commentaries), a play about Rizal, <strong><em>Kagila-gilalas na Kasinungalingan Tungkol sa Isang Kayumangging Bayan</em></strong> (Amazing Lies about a Brown Race), later retitled <strong><em>Kalantiaw</em></strong>, about Jose Marco&rsquo;s Code of Kalantiaw hoax, and <strong><em>Isandaang <strong>Awit</strong> ni Mary Helen Fee</em></strong> (One Hundred Songs of Mary Helen Fee), about the Thomasite teacher; and DUP&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/499\"><strong><em>&hellip; And St. Louis Loves dem Filipinos</em></strong></a>, which was about how Filipinos were paraded at the 1904 World&rsquo;s Fair, USA, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/568\"><strong>Isang Panaginip na Fili</strong></a></em></strong> (A Dreamed Subversion), which was inspired by Rizal&rsquo;s novel, <strong><em>Teatro Porvenir</em></strong> (Theater of Tomorrow), about Andres Bonifacio, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/508\"><strong><em>Atang</em></strong></a>, about Atang de la Rama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Playwrights continue to touch on a myriad of subject matters: <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/516\"><strong>Bayan-bayanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Little Country) on Filipino diaspora abroad, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/504\"><strong>Anatomiya ng Korupsyon</strong></a></em></strong> (Anatomy of Corruption) on corruption, <strong><em>Ang Buhay Ay Pelikula</em></strong> (Life Is a Movie) on the movie industry, <strong><em>Kung Paano Ko Pinatay si Diana Ross</em></strong> (How I Killed Diana Ross) and <strong><em>Gee-Gee at Waterina</em></strong> (Gee-Gee and Waterina) on homosexuality, <strong><em>Welcome to Intelstar</em></strong> on the call center industry, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/685\"><strong>Walang Kukurap</strong></a></em></strong> (Let No One Blink) on government and politics, and <strong><em>Melanie</em></strong> on HIV.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the regions, Community Based Theater Group based in Sorsogon staged productions such as <strong><em>An Tunay na Istorya san Sorsogon</em></strong> (The Real Story of Sorsogon), 1988; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/660\"><strong><em>Si Bulusan nan si Agingay</em></strong></a> (Bulusan and Agingay), 1994; <strong><em>An Gugurang</em></strong> (Divine Being) and <strong><em>Kahadean ni Reyna Gayon</em></strong> (The Kingdom of Queen Gayon), 1996; and <strong><em>Ribonsinay</em></strong> (Mythical Bird), 2002.

Playwright Layeta Bucoy collaborated with director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3228\">Tuxqs Rutaquio</a> to adapt <strong><em>Titus Andronicus</em></strong> into <strong><em>Tinarantadong <strong><strong>Asin</strong></strong>tado</em></strong> for DUP, setting it in the milieu of barangay politics, 2011. Abad and playwright Luarca adapted <strong><em>Romeo and Juliet</em></strong> into <strong><em>Sintang Dalisay</em></strong>, 2011, using the Tinio translation and the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>(<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a>) &ldquo;Ang Sintang Dalisay ni Julieta at Romeo&rdquo; (The Pure Love of Julieta and Romeo) written in 1901 by G. D. Roke. They set the action in a fictional Muslim community and had the actors perform&nbsp;<em>igal</em>, a traditional dance of the Sama people from Tawi-Tawi Province. Guelan Varela Luarca and Brian Sy staged <strong><em>Trobol sa Troya</em></strong> (<strong><em>Troilus and Cressida</em></strong>) for Ateneo de Manila University, 2012, and set in modern times using a hip-hop delivery of the lines. Nonon Padilla directed Lumbera&rsquo;s <strong><em>Haring Lear</em></strong> (<strong><em>King Lear</em></strong>) for PETA, 2012, with an all-male cast in a Japanese-inspired dystopian setting designed by Gino Gonzalez. Vera translated and adapted <strong><em>Twelfth Night</em></strong> to <strong><em>D&rsquo; Wonder Twins of Boac</em></strong> for PETA, 2013, setting it during the decline of the 1960s Philippine film industry, with Viola and Sebastian as a singing-sibling act and Duke Orsino and Countess Olivia as film studio owners. He also adapted Tinio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Negosyante ng Venecia</em></strong> to <strong><em>Der Kaufmann: Ang Negosyante ng Venetia</em></strong> for TP, 2013, creating a &ldquo;play within a play&rdquo; set in Germany during the Nazi occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Theater</strong>. Companies continue to stage plays and musicals geared for children. PETA&rsquo;s original children&rsquo;s productions include <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/515\"><strong>Batang Rizal</strong></a></em></strong> (Young Rizal), <strong><em>Ismail at Isabel</em></strong> (Ismail and Isabel), and <strong><em>William</em></strong>. Adapted from the short stories of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a> is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2039\"><strong><em><strong>Mga Kuwento ni <strong>Lola</strong> Basyang</strong></em></strong></a> (Stories of Grandma Basyang).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TP produced original works such as <strong><em>Prinsipe ng Buwan</em></strong> (Prince of the Moon). It staged an adaptation of Virgilio Almario&rsquo;s retelling of an Asian folktale <strong><em>Dugtong-Dugtong na Sumbong: Ang Hukuman ni Sinukuan</em></strong> (Series of Complaints: The Court of Sinukuan) and an adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5329\">Luis Gatmaitan</a>&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s book <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/655\"><strong>Sandosenang Sapatos</strong></a></em></strong> (A Dozen Pair of Shoes). Adaptations from foreign stories include <strong><em>Pinocchio</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mulan</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Prinsipe Munti</em></strong> (Little Prince). Other TP productions are <strong><em>Tiktipaklong</em></strong>, <strong><em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Ang Pagong at ang Matsing</em></strong> (The Turtle and the Monkey).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rep licenses children&rsquo;s plays or musicals from abroad and presents these productions under its Repertory Children&rsquo;s Theater. Usually, the stories are based on classic Western fairy tales such as <strong><em>Sleeping Beauty</em></strong>, <strong><em>Pinocchio</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Experimental</strong> Theater</strong>. Productions occasionally use experimental scripts, which either have nonlinear story lines or are directed or staged in a nontraditional or unusual manner. Some productions are even staged in nontheater venues. Theater groups based in UP are known for their forays into experimental territory. UP Tropa&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/598\"><strong>Manhid</strong></a></em></strong> (Numb), 1991, was staged along the corridors of Palma Hall instead of a theater. Anton Juan directed his own play <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/537\"><strong><em>Death in a Form of a Rose</em></strong></a>, 1991, combining several texts to devise the script and staging it with poetry reading and movement pieces. In 2010, he directed <strong><em>Information for Foreigners</em></strong>, where audiences were led by &ldquo;tour guides&rdquo; in groups, going up and down different floors and in and out of different rooms in the College of Arts and Letters Building in UP, where different scenes were played out by actors. In the early 2000s, Josefina Estrella staged what may be deemed as the first nondramatic theater piece in the metropolis (or maybe in the entire country). Her <strong><em>Recoged Esta Voz</em></strong> (Gather This Voice) was a montage of visual spectacles: actors dancing and reciting poetry, with video projections on a bare stage with only white drapes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sipat Lawin Ensemble staged <strong><em>Haring Tubul</em></strong>, 2010, in art galleries, prodding audiences to &ldquo;eat&rdquo; one of the character&rsquo;s &ldquo;feces,&rdquo; a concoction that was actually peanut butter. It staged <strong><em>Batallia Royale</em></strong> (Battle Royale), 2012, on the CCP driveway ramp and later in an abandoned school, with audience participation. It also staged <strong><em>Love: This Is Not Yet a Musical (Love: Not)</em></strong>, 2014, a &ldquo;crowd-sourced&rdquo; musical that aimed to document present-day thoughts on love from social media based on more than 300 contributions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2013, Transitopia Contemporary Dance Commune artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2433\">Jose Jay Cruz</a> met with other independent or nonmainstream theater companies such as SLE, Kolab Company, and Destiyero Theatre Commune. The meeting gave birth to MNL X: Festival of New Performances, 2014, a theater event held at the CCP, organized by independent artists and groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the 2010s reaches its midpoint, judging by the number of companies that are currently active as well as the number of works being staged in Metro Manila and other regions, it is neither a boast nor an overestimation to say that Philippine theater is enjoying a new golden era. Filipino artists continue to use theater to contemplate, criticize, commemorate, and celebrate their people&rsquo;s varied travails, truths, and triumphs by preserving, reviving, or evolving traditional genres and works for contemporary audiences; creating new works that Filipinos can enjoy and proudly share with global audiences; translating and adapting foreign materials to expose audiences to international works; and experimenting with new forms that push the envelope. Economics fluctuate, nature sometimes does not cooperate, social norms and trends change faster than the blink of an eye, but the Philippine theater industry not only keeps up and thrives but also forges new colorful and exciting paths for artists, practitioners, scholars and, most importantly, for Filipino audiences.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><strong>Apolonio B.

				"value": "\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the 1986 EDSA Revolt, theater became less obviously political since the main target of artists in the 1970s, the deposed Ferdinand Marcos, was no longer a motivating factor. This did not mean, however, that artists stopped creating or staging works about current events. Theater artists continued to revive old works and create new plays or <a href=\"/7/55/460\">musicals</a> that criticized, satirized, or shed new light on societal ills.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, in the months following the EDSA Revolt, theater artists promptly mounted productions in response to this new chapter in the country&#x2019;s history. The <a href=\"/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a>&#x2019;s (PETA) <strong><em>Panata sa</em></strong> <em><strong><strong><strong>Kala</strong></strong>yaan</strong> </em>(Oath to Freedom), a compendium of stories about the Filipino people during the Marcos regime, was staged at the <a href=\"/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>. The fact that a group like PETA was able to perform at the CCP was a symbolic &#x201C;takeover&#x201D; of the center in that the latter had previously shut out local groups and critical works in favor of foreign acts and what were perceived to be &#x201C;high art&#x201D; productions. <strong><em>Panata</em></strong> was one of the first productions to be staged after martial law and went on to tour in North America, Europe, and Asia, thereby introducing contemporary Philippine theater to international audiences.</p>\n\n<p>Later that year, <a href=\"/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a> staged <a href=\"/7/7/3127\">Bienvenido Noriega</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Bongbong at Kris</em></strong> (Bongbong and Kris) also at the CCP. The third prize winner of that year&#x2019;s CCP Playwriting Contest, the satire is an imagined romance between deposed Marcos&#x2019;s son Bongbong and the new president Corazon Aquino&#x2019;s daughter Kris, signaling in a way that it was all right to start laughing again. <a href=\"/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines (Rep)</a> staged <strong><em>Evita</em></strong>, the musical based on the life of Eva Peron, previously banned in the country as its story line had uncanny parallelisms with Imelda Marcos. In the regions, Negros Theatre League started staging productions that aimed to show that nothing had changed despite having a new government.</p>\n\n<p>In 1989, <a href=\"/7/60/3235\">Lea Salonga</a> and several other Filipino theater actors were cast in the mega-musical <strong><em>Miss Saigon</em></strong> at London&#x2019;s West End. Salonga was later cast in the Broadway staging as well. Publicity for the show highlighted Filipino talent: there were anecdotes of how the producers searched all over the world to find the perfect actors for the roles only to find what they needed in the Philippines. This resulted in increased media exposure for Philippine theater, creating more awareness of Filipino talent among international audiences as well as among the Filipino public.</p>\n\n<p>The restoration of democracy eventually led to social and economic development&#x2014;factors that helped spur growth for the country and, as a result, in the theater scene as well. In the decades following 1986, new Filipino plays and musicals in Filipino and other Philippine languages, as well as in English, were created and staged. Theater programs in the academe and theater companies, professional and otherwise, provided more and more opportunities for artists to perform a variety of genres and materials. New companies and groups were formed, new performance spaces were built, audience numbers grew, and interest in the theater arts was nurtured.</p>\n\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&#xA0;</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"institutions\" name=\"institutions\"></a>Institutions and Groups</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Government Organizations</strong>. After 1986, public and private institutions and organizations went through reorganization or were established, reflecting a renewed and growing interest in Philippine arts. These groups have helped steer the direction of Philippine theater these past few decades.</p>\n\n<p>The Cultural Center of the Philippines reevaluated its mandate under Ma. Teresa Escoda-Roxas and <a href=\"/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>, whose leadership from 1986 to 1994 envisioned the creation of a national culture, focusing on four main points: Filipinization&#x2014;that is, prioritizing Filipino works over foreign acts and emphasizing the staging of new Filipino works; democratization or reaching out to all socioeconomic strata and sectors and not just the elite audiences of the martial law years, and allowing more groups and artists to use CCP venues and resources; decentralization, which means rallying all regions and sectors to showcase their own cultures and contribute to the creation of a national Filipino culture; and reorientation of international exchanges to showcase Filipino artists abroad.</p>\n\n<p>From simply being a venue for performances, CCP transformed into the national coordinating center for the arts. To foster pride in the rich heritage of Filipino artistry, CCP renamed its venues and surrounding streets after Filipino artists. The Main Theater was named Tanghalang <a href=\"/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S. Abelardo</a> in honor of the composer; the Little Theater, Tanghalang <a href=\"/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a> after the playwright and director; and the Bulwagang Gantimpala, Tanghalang Huseng Batute, the pen name of poet <a href=\"/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>. A street was named after <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> playwright <a href=\"/9/80/5707\">Vicente Sotto</a>. CCP also revived the National Artist awards. Theater artists who have received this honor since then include <a href=\"/7/7/2885\">Atang dela Rama</a>, 1987; <a href=\"/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a> (posthumous), 1997; <a href=\"/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a> (posthumous), 1997; <a href=\"/7/7/2991\">Daisy Avellana</a>, 1999; <a href=\"/7/60/3106\">Severino Montano</a> (posthumous), 2001; and <a href=\"/7/7/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a>, 2003.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the center&#x2019;s decentralization efforts, the CCP established arts councils in the regions, developed satellite venues in select cities all over the country, created nationwide events and festivals, and through its Outreach and Exchange Department, organized nationwide tours of performances from Manila to the regions and vice versa. Plays such as <a href=\"/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>&#x2019;s (TP) <strong><em>Mac Malicsi</em></strong> and <strong><em>Tonyo, Pepe at Pule</em></strong> (Tonyo, Pepe, and Pule) were toured in the regions while shows like Marawi-based <a href=\"/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/554\"><strong><em><strong>Halik</strong> sa Kampilan</em></strong></a> (Kiss on the Sword) was brought to Manila, Vigan, Laoag, Baguio, Pampanga, Batangas, and Sorsogon. TP was also sent to Paris in 1994 to perform the <strong><a href=\"/7/55/456\">komedya</a>&#xA0;</strong><strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></em></strong> (Orosman and Zafira).</p>\n\n<p>CCP created the National Theater Festival, gathering theater practitioners from across the country to showcase their best works and network with each other. The first festival, titled &#x201C;Unang Tagpo&#x201D; (First Scene), was held in 1992. This was followed by &#x201C;Ikalawang Tagpo&#x201D; (Second Scene), 1996, and &#x201C;Ikatlong Tagpo&#x201D; (Third Scene), 2004. The festival held in 2012, billed &#x201C;Ikaapat na Tagpo: Ang Bagong Yugto&#x201D; (Fourth Scene: The New Act), included groups from the regions such as the <a href=\"/7/7/3004\">Integrated Performing Arts Guild</a> of Mindanano State University&#x2013;Iligan Institute of Technology, <strong><em>Uwahig</em></strong> (Mindanao Flood Story); <a href=\"/7/7/3109\">Kabpapagariya Ensemble</a> of Mindanao State University&#x2013;General Santos City, <strong><em>Dula Ta</em></strong> (Let&#x2019;s Play); The Xavier Stage of Cagayan de Oro, <strong><em>Isa Pang Kawing</em></strong> (One More Link); Bohol Antequera, Maribojoc Cultural Collective, Teatro Bol-Anon from Bohol, <strong><em>Duha Ka Alimpo sa Habagat</em></strong> (Two Eyes of the Monsoon Storm); Kanlaon Theater Guild of Colegio San Agustin&#x2013;Bacolod, <strong><em>Circulo</em></strong>; <a href=\"/7/7/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation</a> from Bulacan, which staged <strong><em>Kakarong: The <strong>Musical</strong></em></strong>; as well as National Capital Region-based groups <a href=\"/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas (DUP)</a> of the University of the Philippines (UP), <a href=\"/7/58/629\"><strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong></a> (Orosman and Zafira); <a href=\"/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a> of Ateneo de Manila University, <strong><em>Sintang Dalisay</em></strong> (Pure Love); PETA, <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a></em></strong>; <a href=\"/7/7/2958\">Gantimpala Theater Foundation</a>, <strong><em>Sayaw ng mga Senyorita</em></strong> (Dance of the Maidens); Tanghalang Pilipino, <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/670\"><strong>Stageshow</strong></a></em></strong>; <a href=\"/7/7/3328\">Triumphant People&#x2019;s Evangelistic Theater Society (Trumpets)</a>, <strong><em>Mind&#x2019;s Eye</em></strong>; Sipat Lawin Ensemble, <strong><em>Battalia Royale</em></strong> (Battle Royale) and <strong><em>Haring Tubul</em></strong>, an adaptation of <strong><em>Ubu Roi</em></strong>; Silly People&#x2019;s Improv Theater, <strong><em>D4: The Next Generation</em></strong>; and ventriloquists Ony Carcamo and Wanlu, <strong><em>Bata Batute</em></strong> (Child Batute).</p>\n\n<p>Using an earlier proposal from the <a href=\"/9/9/5180\">Concerned Artists of the Philippines</a>, CCP helped prepare the proposal for a ministry of culture, which became the basis for the Presidential Commission on Culture and Arts (PCCA) created by Executive Order 118 in 1987, and later, the <a href=\"/2/11/2682\">National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA)</a>, created via Republic Act 7356, which replaced the PCCA in 1992.</p>\n\n<p>The NCCA makes cultural policies, coordinates and gives grants for the preservation, development, and promotion of Philippine arts and culture, and administers the National Endowment Fund for Culture and the Arts. Through its National Committee on Dramatic Arts, it has given grants to theater productions, conferences, and workshops, and established Tanghal: The National University and College Theater Festival in 2007. Tanghal has since been a gathering of youth theater groups based in colleges and universities who interact with each other, exchange ideas and processes, and showcase outstanding works. It was held at the University of San Agustin, Iloilo, in 2007; West Mindanao State University, Zamboanga, 2008; Colegio de San Juan de Letran, Laguna, 2009; in various venues in Manila, 2010; and University of St. La Salle, Bacolod, 2011. In 2012, the festival was held in four sites: Benguet State University for Luzon; Siliman University, Dumaguete, for the Visayas; Mindanao State University, General Santos City, for Mindanao; and Polytechnic University of the Philippines for the National Capital Region.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Artist Networks and Alliances</strong>. In 1989, under the guidance of <a href=\"/7/60/3355\">Rene O.

The conference had speakers such as Tiongson, <a href=\"/7/60/3206\">Jerry Respeto</a>, Bienvenido Lumbera, <a href=\"/9/9/5255\">Leoncio Deriada</a>, Prospero Covar, <a href=\"/9/9/5573\">Priscelina Legasto</a>, <a href=\"/9/9/5742\">Lulu Torres-Reyes</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/3068\">Orlando Magno</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/2992\">Nestor Horfilla</a>, <a href=\"/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a>, Roberto Mendoza, and <a href=\"/7/60/3148\">Manny Pambid</a>.</p>\n\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_3\">&#xA0;</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"forms\" name=\"forms\"></a>Theater Forms</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Traditional and Classic Forms</strong>. Traditional and classic theater forms, such as the komedya, sinakulo, and sarsuwela, continue to be staged in the regions and in urban settings such as Metro Manila. New groups that stage these classic forms continue to be established as new works continue to be created as well.</p>\n\n<p>The komedya continues to find new incarnations. In 1992, Komedya ng San Dionisio was invited to attend workshops at the CCP to update this traditional form by writing new works using the community&#x2019;s aesthetic standards; using relevant themes to replace the theme of Muslim conversion to Christianity; modernizing the form by tightening plots; and preserving characteristic features such as verse, choreography, and conventional romantic, spectacular, and epic elements (Fernandez 2004, 71-73). The workshop resulted in the staging of <a href=\"/7/58/646\"><strong><em>Ang Bagong <strong>Prinsipe Rodante</strong></em></strong></a> (The New Prince Rodante) in San Dionisio, Para&#xF1;aque, and at the CCP.</p>\n\n<p>In 1994, <a href=\"/7/60/3251\">Jonas Sebastian</a> directed <strong><em><strong><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></strong></em></strong> (Florante and Laura) as a komedya in the playground of Dongalo Elementary School. Students from the school were cast, Sebastian wrote the script, and Salvador Bernal designed the sets and costumes. Ballet Philippines&#x2019;s <a href=\"/6/51/2473\">Nonoy Froilan</a> and Komedya ng San Dionisio&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/60/2987\">Rodante Hernandez</a> choreographed the <a href=\"/5/35/784\"><strong>marchas</strong></a> (marches) and <strong>batallas</strong> (battles) using props and movements from indigenous dances such as&#xA0;<em>sakuting</em>,&#xA0;<em>maglalatik</em>, and&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/6/46/95\">singkil</a>&#xA0;</em>while incorporating modern dances such as cha-cha and boogie and music such as rap.</p>\n\n<p>In 2005, Gantimpala Theater began staging its annual production of <strong><em>Florante at Laura</em></strong> as a komedya, with <a href=\"/7/60/2923\">Tony Espejo</a> directing, using <a href=\"/9/9/5033\">Virgilio Almario</a>&#x2019;s script, and with movements researched by choreographer <a href=\"/6/51/2547\">Ramon A. Obusan</a> from different locales such as San Dionisio, Para&#xF1;aque; Nabuan, Isabela; and Batanes. Later Gantimpala productions of <strong><em>Florante at Laura</em></strong> retained the komedya format while using a new libretto by <a href=\"/7/7/2997\">Boni Ilagan</a>, with music by Toni Mu&#xF1;oz. In 2007, Jerry Respeto directed Rene Villanueva&#x2019;s modern komedya <strong><em>Sandaang Panaginip</em></strong> (A Hundred Dreams), an allegory of the Marcos family first staged in 1981 for ENTABLADO.</p>\n\n<p>In 2008, at the <strong><em>Komedya Fiesta</em></strong>, Komedya ng San Dionisio and Komedya ng Don Galo, both from Para&#xF1;aque City, staged Max Allanigue&#x2019;s <strong><em>Prinsipe Rodante</em></strong> (Prince Rodante); Comedia de Baler from Baler, Aurora, in Northern Luzon performed Isabelita Mejia&#x2019;s <strong><em>Sakim na Pagmamahal</em></strong> (Greedy Love); Komedya San Miguel from Iligan City, Lanao del Norte, staged Ramon and Damaso Padilla&#x2019;s <strong><em>Kinabuhi ni Senyor San Miguel</em></strong> (Life of Saint Michael); and DUP staged Sir Anril Tiatco&#x2019;s adaptation of <strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong> (Orosman and Zafira).</p>\n\n<p>In Los Angeles, USA, San Dionisio sa America was established in the late 1990s by families originally from San Dionisio, Para&#xF1;aque City. It staged <strong><em>Ang Kambal ng Valencia</em></strong> (The Twins of Valencia), 2002; <strong><em>Hermano de la Paz</em></strong>, 2004; <strong><em>Nerissa at Bolivar</em></strong> (Nerrisa and Bolivar), 2006; and Mike Llamas&#x2019;s <strong><em>Esperanza at Caridad</em></strong> (Esperanza and Caridad), 2008, and <strong><em>Mga Prinsesa ng Cordova</em></strong> (The Princesses of Cordova), 2010.</p>\n\n<p>Regional sinakulo performances are still seen annually during Holy Week. The Sariaya Dramatic Guild in Sariaya, Quezon, has performed <strong><em>Santo Kristo: Isang Senakulo</em></strong> (Holy Christ: A Passion Play) since 1904. Sinakulo have been held in several barrios in Malolos, Bulacan, since the 1910s and in San Pedro Cutud, San Fernando, Pampanga, since the 1950s. <strong><em>Ang Pagtaltal sa Balaan Bukid</em></strong> (The Passion of Christ at the Holy Mountain) has been staged in Jordan, Guimaras, since 1975. In Metro Manila, sinakulo have been performed since 1902 in different barangays such as in Malibay, Pasay; in Cainta, Rizal, by Krus sa Nayon Incorporated since 1904 and by <a href=\"/7/7/3236\">Samahang Nazareno</a> since 1960; and in Mandaluyong by Samahang Kabataan ng San Roque Senakulista ng Barangka since 1965. Newer stagings of the sinakulo include <strong><em>Martir sa Golgota</em></strong> (Martyr at Golgotha) in Santa Ana by <a href=\"/7/7/3287\">Tanghalang Santa Ana</a> since 1989; and <strong><em>Ang Tagapagligtas</em></strong> (The Savior) in Morong, Rizal, by Pangkalinangang Kilusan ng mga Taga-Morong since 1993. In Quezon City, <a href=\"/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a> has staged <a href=\"/7/58/641\"><strong><em>Papet <strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (The Passion of Jesus Christ in Puppetry), the only children&#x2019;s puppet sinakulo in the country, since 1985.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarsuwela</strong>, the indigenized Spanish <strong>zarzuela</strong> (play with music), continues to be staged in Ilocos by Paat Dramatic Guild in Bantay and St. Catherine Zarzuela Group in Santa Catalina; in Pangasinan by Tamayo Stage Troupe in Santa Barbara and by Baay Dramatic Association in Lingayen; and in Iloilo by UP Visayas Alumni Theatre Company in Miag-ao. From 1986 to the mid-1990s, the local government of Silay and the Silay City Arts Foundation sponsored an annual sarsuwela competition. In 1994, <a href=\"/7/7/3279\">Tambayo Cultural Group</a> staged a <a href=\"/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a> sarsuwela titled <strong><em>Sirena: Pangasinan Myths and Legends in Lingayen</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Starting 1987, Tanghalang Pilipino, following the CCP&#x2019;s directive of revitalizing traditional forms, has revived and staged existing sarsuwela such as <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), 1987; <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a></em></strong> (After the Darkness), 1989; <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (No Wounds), 1994; and <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/650\"><strong>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</strong></a></em></strong> (At the Mercy of Sharks), 1995. It also staged new sarsuwela like <a href=\"/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907) by Nicanor Tiongson, music by Lutgardo Labad, <a href=\"/7/60/3051\">Lucien Letaba</a>, and <a href=\"/7/60/3156\">Louie Pascasio</a> in 1992, 1993, and 2007. This last play was premiered by PETA in 1982.</p>\n\n<p>In 1998, the National Centennial Commission hosted the Centennial Literary Prize. First prize winner for the sarsuwela category was Mario O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/639\"><strong>Palasyo ni Valentin</strong></a></em></strong> (Palace of Valentin), music by Minda Azarcon, staged by PETA that same year. There was a three-way tie for second prize: George de Jesus&#x2019;s <strong><em>Paglayang Minamahal</em></strong> (Beloved Freedom), music by <a href=\"/4/26/4517\">Jesse Lucas</a>, staged by Tanghalang Pilipino in 2000; Bienvenido Lumbera&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/557\"><strong>Hibik at Himagsik nina Victoria Laktaw Atbp.</strong></a></em></strong> (Plea and Revolt of Victoria Laktaw and Others), music by Lucien Letaba, staged by DUP in 2002; and Melba Padilla Maggay&#x2019;s <strong><em>Bayan, Isang Paa na Lamang</em></strong> (Nation: Just One Foot Left), music by <a href=\"/5/5/4162\">Lucio San Pedro</a>, staged by Institute for Studies in Asian Church and Culture in 2002.</p>\n\n<p>Other new sarsuwela include <a href=\"/9/9/5653\">Alejandro Roces</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Something to Crow About</em></strong>, 2006, based on his short story &#x201C;My Brother&#x2019;s Peculiar Chicken,&#x201D; staged in Manila, 2006, and in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, 2007; Nicanor G. Tiongson&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/512\"><strong>Basilia ng Malolos</strong></a></em></strong> (Basilia of Malolos), music by <a href=\"/5/42/4074\">Joy Marfil</a>, staged by DUP, 2007; Bonifacio Ilagan&#x2019;s <strong><em>Ang Se&#xF1;orita at ang Hukbo</em></strong> (The Lady and the Soldier), music by Lucien Letaba, 2008.</p>\n\n<p>At the National Sarsuwela Festival in 2009, the <a href=\"/7/60/3333\">University of the East Drama Company</a> staged <a href=\"/7/58/636\"><strong><em>Paglipas ng Dilim</em></strong></a> (After the Darkness), Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation performed <strong><em>Walang Sugat</em></strong>, Far Eastern University&#x2019;s Art Theatre Clinique performed <a href=\"/7/58/650\"><strong><em>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</em></strong></a>, UP in the Visayas Alumni Theatre Company presented <strong><em>Iloilo Sarswela: Padayon ang Istorya</em></strong> (Iloilo Sarsuwela: The Story Continues), and DUP staged <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/582\"><strong>Ang Kiri</strong></a></em></strong> (The Flirt). In 2010, the University of the East Drama Company staged <strong><em>Miss Philippines</em></strong> for Tanghal, the NCCA-organized National University and College Theater Festival.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Western-Type Musicals</strong>. Filipino theater groups continue to stage classics and produce new works in the musical genre, combining influences from the traditional musical forms of sarsuwela, <a href=\"/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> (indigenized vaudeville), and&#xA0;<em><a href=\"/5/35/782\">kundiman</a>&#xA0;</em>(classic love songs) even as they adopt and adapt new and developing forms, devices, and trends from around the world such as musicals, sung-through musicals, rock operas, and mega-musicals. PETA and Tanghalang Pilipino stage original musicals as part of their season.</p>\n\n<p>History and its heroes always serve as inspirational subject matter for musicals. PETA staged <strong><em>1896: The Musicale</em></strong>, 1995, a narrative about <a href=\"/9/80/5393\">Emilio Jacinto</a>, to commemorate the centennial of the Filipino&#x2019;s revolt against colonial Spain. Musicat staged <strong><em>Alikabok</em></strong> (Dust), 1995, a play about the Katipunera Bising Vallejo. DUP staged <strong><em>Gabriela</em></strong>, 2005, which is about Gabriela Silang. TP staged <strong><em>Aguinaldo 1899: Ang Pagpatay kay Luna</em></strong> (Aguinaldo 1899: The Murder of Luna), 1998, which is about Emilio Aguinaldo; <strong><em>EJ: Ang Pinagdaanang Buhay nina Evelio Javier at Edgar Jopson</em></strong> (EJ: The Lives of Evelio Javier and Edgar Jopson), 2008, a <strong>jukebox musical</strong> about martial law activists Javier and Jopson that uses songs by the rock band <a href=\"/5/42/3957\">The Dawn</a>; <strong><em>San Andres B</em></strong>, 2013, which is about <a href=\"/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>; and <strong><em>Mabining Mandirigma</em></strong> (Gentle Warrior), 2015, which centers on <a href=\"/9/80/5471\">Apolinario Mabini</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/4/24/1196\">Jose Rizal</a> and his novels also provide inspiration for theatrical works. DUP, for instance, staged <strong><em>Elias at <strong>Salome</strong></em></strong> (Elias and Salome), 1996, while TP staged <strong><em>Noli Me Tangere</em></strong>, <strong><em>El Filibusterismo</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Ilustrado: Ang Buhay ni Rizal</em></strong> (Educated Native: The Life of Rizal). Musicat produced <strong><em>Sino Ka Ba, Jose Rizal?</em></strong> (Who Are You, Jose Rizal?), 1996.</p>\n\n<p>Philippine literature originally written in English has inspired adaptations such as TP&#x2019;s <strong><em>Florante at Laura</em></strong> (Florante and Laura), 1988, and <strong><em><strong>Banaag at Sikat</strong></em></strong> (Glimmer and Light), 2010, a rock musical based on the novel by <strong><strong><strong><strong>Lope K. Santos</strong></strong></strong></strong>; Musicat&#x2019;s <strong><em>Larawan</em></strong> (Portrait), 1997, based on Nick Joaquin&#x2019;s play <strong><em><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></em></strong>, and <strong><em>Fire Water Woman</em></strong>, 2000, based on Joaquin&#x2019;s play <strong><em>Tatarin: A Witches&#x2019; Sabbath in Three Acts</em></strong> and on his short story &#x201C;The Summer Solstice.&#x201D;</p>\n\n<p>Pop culture reflected in film and<em>komiks</em>have also provided inspiration for musical adaptations. TP staged <strong><em>Himala: The Musical</em></strong>, 2000, based on the film of the same title, and <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/692\"><strong>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Muzikal</strong></a></em></strong>, 2006, based on the graphic novel, also of the same title. Musicat staged <strong><em><strong>Kenkoy</strong> Loves Rosing</em></strong>, 1992, based on the komiks version. Bit by Bit Productions staged <a href=\"/7/58/602\"><strong><em>Maxie: The Musical</em></strong></a>, 2005, based on the film <a href=\"/4/24/1257\"><strong><em><strong>Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo <strong>Oliver</strong>os</strong></em></strong></a> (<strong><em>The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros</em></strong>). Viva Productions and Full House Theater Company has staged <strong><em>Bituing Walang Ningning</em></strong> (Star without Sparkle), 2015, based on the film and komiks version of the same title.</p>\n\n<p>Musicals range from revivals of older musical genres to new and emerging forms. <strong>Bodabil</strong> tunes have been revisited in such musicals as Musicat&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/581\"><strong><em>Katy!</em></strong></a>, 1988, and TP&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/670\"><strong><em>Stageshow</em></strong></a>, 2012. But rap has also been used to comment on corruption as in TP&#x2019;s <strong><em>Kleptomaniacs</em></strong>, 2014. PETA has staged musicals that talk about current events and issues, like <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/667\"><strong>Skin Deep</strong></a></em></strong>, 2008, a dark comedy on the cosmetic surgery industry, and <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/529\"><strong>Care Divas</strong></a></em></strong>, 2010, a play about a group of overseas Filipino workers who moonlight as cross-dressing performers. It has also staged <a href=\"/7/58/647\"><strong><em>Rak of <strong><strong>Aegis</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, 2014, a jukebox musical using songs by rock band <a href=\"/5/42/3855\">Aegis</a> that touches on the hopes and frustrations of families in a fictitious barangay dealing with constant flooding.</p>\n\n<p>Musicals with religious themes have also been staged. <strong><em>Magnificat</em></strong>, about the life of Jesus Christ as seen through the eyes of his mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, written by Nestor Torre with music by <a href=\"/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>, was staged from 1996 to 2012. Trumpets has produced evangelical musicals in English such as <strong><em>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</em></strong>, 1997; <strong><em>The Little Mermaid</em></strong>, 2000; <strong><em>N.O.A.H. (No Ordinary Aquatic Habitat)</em></strong>, 2009; and <strong><em>Bluebird of Happiness</em></strong>, 2013.</p>\n\n<p>The pulse, emotions, and music of the streets also provide inspiration for performances. Teatro Pabrika, for instance, integrates songs in union meetings and picket lines or mounts productions advocating better working conditions for workers such as <strong><em><strong><strong>Harana</strong></strong>ng Bayan I</em></strong> (Serenade for the Nation I), 1991, <strong><em>Haranang Bayan II</em></strong> (Serenade for the Nation II), 1992, <strong><em>Kuwatro Kantos</em></strong> (Four Corners), 1995, and <strong><em>Ultimatum</em></strong>, 1998.</p>\n\n<p>Rep and Atlantis are the most consistent in staging foreign musicals, usually from the United States and the United Kingdom. In the late 1980s, Repertory Philippines (Rep) did <strong><em>Evita</em></strong>, <strong><em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em></strong>, <strong><em>Little Shop of <strong>Horror</strong>s</em></strong>, <strong><em>Man of La Mancha</em></strong>, <strong><em>Nunsense</em></strong>, <strong><em>La Cage Aux Folles</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Kismet</em></strong>; in the1990s, <strong><em>Scrooge</em></strong>, <strong><em>The King and I</em></strong>, <strong><em>Grease</em></strong>, <strong><em>Fiddler on the Roof</em></strong>, <strong><em>Into the Woods</em></strong>, <strong><em>Les Miserables</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Wiz</em></strong>, <strong><em>My Fair Lady</em></strong>, <strong><em>Camelot</em></strong>, <strong><em>Once on This Island</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jesus Christ Superstar</em></strong>, <strong><em>Carousel</em></strong>, <strong><em>South Pacific</em></strong>, <strong><em>Annie</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Oliver!</em></strong>; in the 2000s, <strong><em>The Secret Garden</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Sound of Music</em></strong>, <strong><em><strong>Altar</strong> Boyz</em></strong>, Disney&#x2019;s <strong><em>Mulan</em></strong>, <strong><em>A Christmas Carol</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Sweeney Todd</em></strong>; and in the 2010s, <strong><em>Little Women</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Wizard of Oz</em></strong>, <strong><em>Disney&#x2019;s Camp Rock: The Musical</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Alice in Wonderland</em></strong>. Atlantis&#x2019;s inaugural production was <strong><em>Rent</em></strong> in 1999. Since then it has staged, in the 2000s, <strong><em>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Rocky Horror Show</em></strong>, <strong><em>Dreamgirls</em></strong>, <strong><em>Urinetown</em></strong>, Disney&#x2019;s <strong><em>Beauty and the Beast</em></strong>, <strong><em>Avenue Q</em></strong>, <strong><em>Hairspray</em></strong>, <strong><em>Spring Awakening</em></strong>, <strong><em>and Legally Blonde</em></strong>; in the 2010s, Disney&#x2019;s <strong><em>Little Mermaid</em></strong>, <strong><em>Next to Normal</em></strong>, <strong><em>In the <strong><strong>Heights</strong></strong></em></strong>, <strong><em>Rock of Ages</em></strong>, Disney&#x2019;s <strong><em>Aladdin</em></strong>, <strong><em>Piaf</em></strong>, <strong><em>Carrie</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Addams Family</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ghost: The Musical</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Shrek</em></strong>. Rep and Atlantis have also toured their productions in other Asian cities such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and Jakarta.</p>\n\n<p>In 1999, SK Productions staged <strong><em>Rama at Sita</em></strong> (Rama and Sita) at the UP Theater. It was a large-scale musical based on the Indian epic <strong><em>Ramayana</em></strong> and was reported to have cost 40 million pesos to produce. From 2000 to 2001, <strong><em>Miss Saigon</em></strong> was staged in Manila, with Lea Salonga and <a href=\"/7/60/2732\">Isay Alvarez</a> reprising their roles as Kim and Gigi, respectively, in the musical&#x2019;s 1989 world premiere at the West End. This production took over the usual theater and rehearsal venues of CCP resident companies Tanghalang Pilipino and Ballet Philippines, prompting strong reactions from the local theater community about how a foreign production was displacing local artists. A decade later, production company Concertus Manila produced the Manila run of the international production <strong><em>Cats</em></strong>, 2010, with Salonga as Grizabella, also at the CCP. This began what has become a consistent stream of international productions such as <strong><em>Phantom of the Opera</em></strong>, 2013, <strong><em>Wicked</em></strong>, 2014, and <strong><em>Chicago</em></strong>, 2015, proving that now there is a big enough audience in the Philippines and an economy strong enough to bring in touring productions in Manila, which provide stiff competition for local theater companies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Straight Plays</strong>. Original plays continue to be created after 1986. In the 1990s, social and psychological realism in theater became more dominant as audiences became more interested in the characterizations and internal conflicts of characters than in political motifs that dominated the theater scene from 1972 to 1986. <a href=\"/7/60/3164\">Tony Perez</a> wrote plays that touch on middle-class characters dealing with the psychological underpinnings of love and loss such as <strong><em>Saan Ba Tayo Ihahatid ng Disyembre?</em></strong> (Where Will December Bring Us?), staged by PETA, and <strong><em>Oktubre, Noong Tayo&#x2019;y Nagmamahalan Pa</em></strong> (October, When We Were Still in Love) and <strong><em>Nobyembre, Noong Akala Ko&#x2019;y Mahal Kita</em></strong> (November, When I Thought I Love You), staged by TP.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, plays about the martial law years and its aftereffects, political activism, and human rights violations such as forced disappearances continued to be staged such as DUP&#x2019;s <strong><em>Desaparecidos</em></strong> (Forced Disappearances); TP&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em><strong><a href=\"/7/58/596\"><strong>Maliw</strong></a></strong> </em>(Fade),&#xA0;<em><strong><a href=\"/7/58/566\"><strong>Isang Araw sa Karnabal</strong></a></strong> </em>(A Day in the Carnival), and <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/526\"><strong>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</strong></a></em></strong> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major); and Atlantis Productions&#x2019; <strong><em><strong>Dogeaters</strong></em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Plays continued to find inspiration in history such as PETA&#x2019;s <strong><em>Lakangbini</em></strong> (Las Viajeras/Oryang) and <strong><em>Ang Dalawang Buhay ni Plaridel</em></strong> (Almanac for Revolution), which were about Gregoria de Jesus and Marcelo del Pilar, respectively; TP&#x2019;s <strong><em>Ang Paglilitis at Pagkamatay ni Jose Rizal: Mga Teksto at Mga Komentaryo</em></strong> (The Trial and Death of Jose Rizal: Texts and Commentaries), a play about Rizal, <strong><em>Kagila-gilalas na Kasinungalingan Tungkol sa Isang Kayumangging Bayan</em></strong> (Amazing Lies about a Brown Race), later retitled <strong><em>Kalantiaw</em></strong>, about Jose Marco&#x2019;s Code of Kalantiaw hoax, and <strong><em>Isandaang <strong>Awit</strong> ni Mary Helen Fee</em></strong> (One Hundred Songs of Mary Helen Fee), about the Thomasite teacher; and DUP&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/499\"><strong><em>&#x2026; And St. Louis Loves dem Filipinos</em></strong></a>, which was about how Filipinos were paraded at the 1904 World&#x2019;s Fair, USA, <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/568\"><strong>Isang Panaginip na Fili</strong></a></em></strong> (A Dreamed Subversion), which was inspired by Rizal&#x2019;s novel, <strong><em>Teatro Porvenir</em></strong> (Theater of Tomorrow), about Andres Bonifacio, and <a href=\"/7/58/508\"><strong><em>Atang</em></strong></a>, about Atang de la Rama.</p>\n\n<p>Playwrights continue to touch on a myriad of subject matters: <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/516\"><strong>Bayan-bayanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Little Country) on Filipino diaspora abroad, <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/504\"><strong>Anatomiya ng Korupsyon</strong></a></em></strong> (Anatomy of Corruption) on corruption, <strong><em>Ang Buhay Ay Pelikula</em></strong> (Life Is a Movie) on the movie industry, <strong><em>Kung Paano Ko Pinatay si Diana Ross</em></strong> (How I Killed Diana Ross) and <strong><em>Gee-Gee at Waterina</em></strong> (Gee-Gee and Waterina) on homosexuality, <strong><em>Welcome to Intelstar</em></strong> on the call center industry, <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/685\"><strong>Walang Kukurap</strong></a></em></strong> (Let No One Blink) on government and politics, and <strong><em>Melanie</em></strong> on HIV.</p>\n\n<p>In the regions, Community Based Theater Group based in Sorsogon staged productions such as <strong><em>An Tunay na Istorya san Sorsogon</em></strong> (The Real Story of Sorsogon), 1988; <a href=\"/7/58/660\"><strong><em>Si Bulusan nan si Agingay</em></strong></a> (Bulusan and Agingay), 1994; <strong><em>An Gugurang</em></strong> (Divine Being) and <strong><em>Kahadean ni Reyna Gayon</em></strong> (The Kingdom of Queen Gayon), 1996; and <strong><em>Ribonsinay</em></strong> (Mythical Bird), 2002.

What started as a festival of one-act plays has grown to include full-length plays and even musicals from both the group&#x2019;s members and from submissions from the public.

It staged an adaptation of Virgilio Almario&#x2019;s retelling of an Asian folktale <strong><em>Dugtong-Dugtong na Sumbong: Ang Hukuman ni Sinukuan</em></strong> (Series of Complaints: The Court of Sinukuan) and an adaptation of <a href=\"/9/9/5329\">Luis Gatmaitan</a>&#x2019;s children&#x2019;s book <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/655\"><strong>Sandosenang Sapatos</strong></a></em></strong> (A Dozen Pair of Shoes). Adaptations from foreign stories include <strong><em>Pinocchio</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mulan</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Prinsipe Munti</em></strong> (Little Prince). Other TP productions are <strong><em>Tiktipaklong</em></strong>, <strong><em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Ang Pagong at ang Matsing</em></strong> (The Turtle and the Monkey).</p>\n\n<p>Rep licenses children&#x2019;s plays or musicals from abroad and presents these productions under its Repertory Children&#x2019;s Theater. Usually, the stories are based on classic Western fairy tales such as <strong><em>Sleeping Beauty</em></strong>, <strong><em>Pinocchio</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><strong><strong>Experimental</strong> Theater</strong>. Productions occasionally use experimental scripts, which either have nonlinear story lines or are directed or staged in a nontraditional or unusual manner. Some productions are even staged in nontheater venues. Theater groups based in UP are known for their forays into experimental territory. UP Tropa&#x2019;s <strong><em><a href=\"/7/58/598\"><strong>Manhid</strong></a></em></strong> (Numb), 1991, was staged along the corridors of Palma Hall instead of a theater. Anton Juan directed his own play <a href=\"/7/58/537\"><strong><em>Death in a Form of a Rose</em></strong></a>, 1991, combining several texts to devise the script and staging it with poetry reading and movement pieces. In 2010, he directed <strong><em>Information for Foreigners</em></strong>, where audiences were led by &#x201C;tour guides&#x201D; in groups, going up and down different floors and in and out of different rooms in the College of Arts and Letters Building in UP, where different scenes were played out by actors. In the early 2000s, Josefina Estrella staged what may be deemed as the first nondramatic theater piece in the metropolis (or maybe in the entire country). Her <strong><em>Recoged Esta Voz</em></strong> (Gather This Voice) was a montage of visual spectacles: actors dancing and reciting poetry, with video projections on a bare stage with only white drapes.</p>\n\n<p>Sipat Lawin Ensemble staged <strong><em>Haring Tubul</em></strong>, 2010, in art galleries, prodding audiences to &#x201C;eat&#x201D; one of the character&#x2019;s &#x201C;feces,&#x201D; a concoction that was actually peanut butter. It staged <strong><em>Batallia Royale</em></strong> (Battle Royale), 2012, on the CCP driveway ramp and later in an abandoned school, with audience participation. It also staged <strong><em>Love: This Is Not Yet a Musical (Love: Not)</em></strong>, 2014, a &#x201C;crowd-sourced&#x201D; musical that aimed to document present-day thoughts on love from social media based on more than 300 contributions.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, Transitopia Contemporary Dance Commune artistic director <a href=\"/6/51/2433\">Jose Jay Cruz</a> met with other independent or nonmainstream theater companies such as SLE, Kolab Company, and Destiyero Theatre Commune. The meeting gave birth to MNL X: Festival of New Performances, 2014, a theater event held at the CCP, organized by independent artists and groups.</p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"conclusion\" name=\"conclusion\"></a>Conclusion</strong></p>\n\n<p>As the 2010s reaches its midpoint, judging by the number of companies that are currently active as well as the number of works being staged in Metro Manila and other regions, it is neither a boast nor an overestimation to say that Philippine theater is enjoying a new golden era. Filipino artists continue to use theater to contemplate, criticize, commemorate, and celebrate their people&#x2019;s varied travails, truths, and triumphs by preserving, reviving, or evolving traditional genres and works for contemporary audiences; creating new works that Filipinos can enjoy and proudly share with global audiences; translating and adapting foreign materials to expose audiences to international works; and experimenting with new forms that push the envelope. Economics fluctuate, nature sometimes does not cooperate, social norms and trends change faster than the blink of an eye, but the Philippine theater industry not only keeps up and thrives but also forges new colorful and exciting paths for artists, practitioners, scholars and, most importantly, for Filipino audiences.<span class>&#xA0;</span></p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Content</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"section\">\n<p><a href=\"/7/54/434\">American Traditions and Transformations in Philippine Theater (1900 Onward)</a><br />\n<a href=\"/7/55/449\">Drama</a><br />\n<a href=\"/7/55/468\">Realism</a><br />\n<a href=\"/7/55/460\">Musical Theater</a><br />\n<a href=\"/7/54/438\">Philippine Theater in the Diaspora</a></p>\n\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong><a id=\"sources\" name=\"sources\"></a>Sources</strong></p>\n\n<div class=\"src\">\n<p>Abad, Ricardo G. 2002. &#x201C;A Postcolonial View of Shakespeare&#x2019;s Shrew: A Director&#x2019;s Narrative.&#x201D; <em>The Loyola Schools Review: Humanities Edition</em> 2.

Their works are informed not only by their memory of the homeland but also by the Philippines&rsquo;s colonial history, its politics and economic conditions, and the desire to link migrant narratives to that of the narrative of home. In their plays are discourses on exile, labor, colonialism, gender, geopolitics, and class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"diaspora\" name=\"diaspora\"></a>Early Diaspora Theater</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The roots of diaspora theater can be traced to touring performances, early collaborations with Asian artists, actors who become professional workers abroad, and foreign exchanges. Among the Philippine theater groups that have performed in tours of Asia, Europe, and the United States were the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> with <strong><em>Panata sa <strong><strong>Kala</strong></strong>yaan</em></strong> (Oath to Freedom), 1986, and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3022\">Kaliwat Theater Collective</a> with <strong><em>Lem a Feu sa Habagatan</em></strong> (Spirit of Paradise) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 1992, and Korea, 1998; <strong><em>Dis Place</em></strong> (This Place) in Australia, 1996; and <strong><em>Oya! Arakan</em></strong> (Oh! Arakan) in Singapore in 1999.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of collaborations, one of the earliest was <strong><em>Cry of Asia</em></strong>, 1989, through the Asian Council for People&rsquo;s Culture, with concept and direction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>. The performance incorporated 10 languages and included participants from India, Pakistan, Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, and Japan. In a 90-minute performance that incorporated traditional and contemporary forms to tell a tale of spectacle and deceit, power dynamics, and the triumph of collective action, Kaliwat Theater Collective, led by its artistic director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2992\">Nestor Horfilla</a>, also engaged in collaborations through its Dancing Land collaborative performance with Assignment Theater in Taiwan, 1989.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the earliest theater artists who became migrant workers were the actors who performed in the West End production of <strong><em>Miss Saigon</em></strong> in London in 1989. They were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3235\">Lea Salonga</a> who played the role of Kim, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3366\">Monique Wilson</a> (her alternate), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2732\">Isay Alvarez</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3001\">Junix Inocian</a>, Robert Se&ntilde;a, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3043\">Cocoy Laurel</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2734\">Pinky Amador</a>. Salonga won the Olivier in 1990, and in 1991 performed the same role on Broadway, winning the Tony and the Drama Desk Awards of that year. Other Filipina actors who became migrant professionals to play Kim were Joanna Ampil, Jamie Rivera, and Jenine Desiderio in London; Caselyn Francisco and Lani Sumalinog in Germany; and Ima Castro in Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artists who have participated in exchanges were <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a>, who gave workshops in several Asian countries; PETA artists who collaborated with the Black Tent theater group of Japan; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\">Chris Millado</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3188\">Dessa Quesada</a>, who gave workshops to Maori communities in 1987; Bugkos theater artists who worked with the Hagurumaza theater group in Japan in the late 1980s; and women playwrights led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a>, who engaged in conferences through Women Playwrights International.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contemporary Philippine diaspora theater can be divided into three main types: sustained production through a professional or community theater company or a performing space; random productions or single performances mounted by organizations, communities, or groups for a specific purpose or as a response to a particular issue; and the works of individual artists in university, community, or professional theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"companies\" name=\"companies\"></a>Theater Companies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, among the most successful Asian American theater groups is Ma-Yi Theatre Company. Founded in 1989 by Chito Jao Garces (who was its founding artistic director), Ralph Pe&ntilde;a (the current artistic director), Margot Lloren, Anne Frilles, Luz de Leon, Isolda Oca, Arianne Recto, Cristina Sison, and Bernie Villanueva, its first productions were Filipino plays and adaptations. Key Ma-yi artists include executive director Jorge Ortoll, associate director Suzette Porte, director and designer Loy Arcenas, composer Fabian Obispo, actors Ching Valdez and Mia Katigbak, literary manager <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5094\">Joi Barrios-Leblanc</a>, and guest artist Chris Millado. While Ma-yi&rsquo;s early plays such as Linda Faigao Hall&rsquo;s <strong><em>Woman from the Other End of the World</em></strong> and Ralph Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s <strong><em>Flipzoids</em></strong>, both in 1996, and Han Ong&rsquo;s <strong><em>Middle Finger</em></strong>, 2000, countered negative portrayals and stereotypes of Asian Americans by focusing on the characters&rsquo; contradictions, negotiations of identity, and intergenerational conflicts, its later productions interrogated history as in Chris Millado&rsquo;s <strong><em>PeregriNasyon</em></strong>, 1998, and Ralph Pe&ntilde;a and Sung Rno&rsquo;s <strong><em>Project Balangiga</em></strong>, 2002; examined popular culture as in Sung Rno&rsquo;s <strong><em>wAve</em></strong>, 2004; reframed memory as in Qui Nguyen&rsquo;s <strong><em>Trial by Water</em></strong>, 2006; and indicted neocolonial globalization, as exemplified by Lonnie Carter&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Romance of Magno Rubio</em></strong>, with Tagalog text by Pe&ntilde;a, 2002, and Kia Cothron, Sung Rno, and Jorge Corti&ntilde;as&rsquo;s <strong><em>Savage Acts</em></strong>, 2004. These plays have been anthologized in <strong><em>Savage Stage</em></strong>, 2007, which argues that by creating a theater of disturbance, employing elements of the &ldquo;savage&rdquo; as weapons of dissent, and performing that which is empowering, the company is able to redefine the &ldquo;savage stage&rdquo; of Asian American theater. Ma-yi&rsquo;s works have won 10 OBIE Awards, a Drama Desk nomination for Best Play, Henry Hewes Design Award nominations, and in May 2010, a special Drama Desk award for &ldquo;more than two decades of excellence and for nurturing Asian American voices in stylistically varied and engaging theatre.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two other groups that have sustained productions in the United States are Bindlestiff Studio in San Francisco and CIRCA Pintig in Chicago. Bindlestiff Studio started as an experimental theater space when it was founded in 1989 by Canadian artists Chrystene Ells, Chris Brophy, and a group of local theater artists. However, when Allan S. Manalo became the studio&rsquo;s artistic and managing director in 1997, the studio set out to become a center for Filipino-American performing arts in the Bay Area. Manalo&rsquo;s theater group Tongue in a Mood staged Kevin Camia, Patty Cachapero, and Manalo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tsismis</em></strong> (Gossip) in 1997 and <strong><em>Damo</em></strong> (Grass/Weed) in 1999. Another theater group, Teatro ng Tanan, active in the Bay area in the 1990s, has had an enduring influence on the studio, through its workshop series culminating in an annual production titled <strong><em><strong>Stories</strong> High</em></strong>. Although Bindlestiff lost its theater to the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency (SFRA) in 2003, SFRA subsequently built a 99-seat, black box theater for them in the rebuilt housing complex, and this opened in 2011. Among Bindlestiff&rsquo;s productions are Lorna Velasco&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Pinoy Midsummer</em></strong>, 2013; a series of works called <strong><em>The Bakla Show</em></strong> (The Gay Show); and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a>&rsquo;s adaptation of the novel <strong><em>The Guerillas of Powell Street</em></strong> by Benjamin Pimentel, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CIRCA Pintig, based in Chicago is composed of two groups: Pintig, founded in 1991 by a group of artists, activists, professionals, and community organizers, and the Center for Immigrant Resources and Community Arts (CIRCA), founded in 2001. The two groups came together in 2006 to form a community theater company and a community education and outreach organization. Among the group&rsquo;s leaders are artistic director Angela Mascarenas, composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3156\">Louie Pascasio</a>, Levi and Christy Aliposa, Daisy Castro, Ginger and Larry Leopoldo, and Divina Calo. The group&rsquo;s body of work interrogates Philippine American colonial relations and articulates the migrant experience through Chris Millado&rsquo;s adaptation of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1688\"><strong>America Is in the Heart</strong></a></em></strong>, 1992, a novel by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5138\">Carlos Bulosan</a>; Rody Vera and Louie Pascasio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bells of Balangiga</em></strong>, 1997, remounted in 2007; Larry Leopoldo&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>Scent of Home</strong> </em>, 2006 and 2014, an adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5686\">Bienvenido Santos</a>&rsquo;s short stories; Lani Montreal Bermudez&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dama</em></strong>,&nbsp;<em>2</em>002 and 2014; and Noel Alumit&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mr. and Mrs. LaQuesta Go Dancing</em></strong>, 2009 and 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, Carlos Bulosan Theater (formerly the Carlos Bulosan Cultural Workshop) based in Ontario, Canada, has been staging plays since 1982, with the aim of producing &ldquo;theatre that reflects social and political issues affecting the Filipino and the broader community.&rdquo; Founded in 1982 by Fely Villasin and Martha Ocampo, it has produced works such as Fely Villasin&rsquo;s <strong><em>If My Mother Could See Me Now/Inay Kung Alam Mo Lang</em></strong>, 1989 and 1990, a play on domestic workers; Nina Lee Aquino and Nadine Villasin&rsquo;s <strong><em>Miss (Oriented)</em></strong>, 2003, which examines the politics of culture identity through the eyes of three contestants in the beauty pageant &ldquo;Miss Pearl of the Orient&rdquo;; <strong><em>People Power</em></strong>, 2006, restaged in 2008 and 2010, a play on the 1986 EDSA Revolt that ended the Marcos dictatorship; <strong><em>In the Shadow of Elephants</em></strong>, 2013, which was on the Philippines&rsquo;s history of resistance against colonial rule; and the annual <strong><em>Tales from the Flipside</em></strong>. Key members of the group include Leon Aureus (the artistic director), Rose Cortez, Nicco Lorenzo, Christine Mangosing, and N. Villasin, all collaborators in the staging of both <strong><em>People Power</em></strong> and <strong><em>In the Shadow of Elephants</em></strong>, as well as Board President Rina Espiritu. The theater company partners with the Kapisanan Philippine Centre for Arts and Culture for community events and facilitates education workshops on Philippine history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United Kingdom, Philippine Theatre UK, led by its artistic director Ramon Castillanes Te&ntilde;oso and managing director Maurice Newberry, has produced around 15 original plays since it was founded in 2002. A graduate of the University of the Philippines (UP) with a master&rsquo;s degree in psychology, Te&ntilde;oso had worked for the CEO of the Society of London Theatres/Theatrical Management. He also wrote a stage adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></strong></em></strong> (Subversion), 1998, and&nbsp;<em><strong>Debt (Death) Trap</strong> </em>, 1998. Te&ntilde;oso has served as the company&rsquo;s playwright, director, and trainer. The company has trained more than 100 Filipino and British actors. Among the pioneering works of Philippine Theatre UK are <strong><em>Birthmark</em></strong>, 2004, a play about a gay man, a lesbian, and a straight man living together; <strong><em>Pater Noster</em></strong> (Our Father), 2006, which focuses on the life of Filipino seafarers; <strong><em>Four Ladies</em></strong>, 2007, which is about four famous Filipinas&mdash;namely, Imelda Marcos, Corazon Aquino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4638\">Susan Roces</a>, and Gloria Arroyo; <strong><em>Migrants</em></strong>, 2012; and <strong><em>The Enchanted Bird</em></strong>, a retelling of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1880\"><strong><em>Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></em></strong></a>, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"community\" name=\"community\"></a>Community Theater Groups</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The production of plays, however, is not limited to theater companies. In some cases, organizations or community groups stage their plays through a cultural section or teams of artists. In others, individual Filipino playwrights/performers stage their own works or have them produced by other companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example is the Filipina Women&rsquo;s Network, which staged Eve Ensler&rsquo;s <strong><em>Vagina Monologues</em></strong>, with performances either in both Filipino and English or English only, in San Francisco and New York in 2004-13. First directed by Elena Buensalido and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2791\">Bernardo Bernardo</a> and later by Bettina Santos Yap, the production integrated songs such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/994\">Sa Ugoy ng Duyan</a>&rdquo; (In the Cradle&rsquo;s Rocking), &ldquo;Ili-ili,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Babae&rdquo; (Woman). In its 9th and 10th years, the former all-Filipina cast members were joined by other Asia-Pacific women to reflect both the diversity of the city and the collaborative work of Asia-Pacific women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the earliest groups to have performed in the United States was Sining Bayan, which was active from 1973 to 1981, and which defined itself as the cultural arm of the national democratic organization Katipunan ng mga Demokratikong Pilipino. In the book <strong><em>Puro Arte: Filipinos on the Stages of Empire</em></strong> (2013), Lucy Mae San Pablo Burns studied the plays performed by the group, and noted that &ldquo;Sining Bayan rendered their work as a vehicle to popularize their political agenda, and as an organizing tool&rdquo; (86). Burns also explained that although Ermena Vinluan was the driving force, crucial to the creative process of the group was collective work, thereby challenging mainstream theater processes. Among the group&rsquo;s works cited by Burns are <strong><em>Isuda ti Imunal/They Who Were First</em></strong>, which focused on Filipino migrant workers; <strong><em>Warbrides</em></strong>, on Filipina war brides; <strong><em>Mindanao</em></strong>, on Southern Philippines; <strong><em><strong>Sakada</strong></em></strong>, on peasant workers; <strong><em>Narciso and Perez</em></strong>, on two Filipina nurses who were victims of racism; <strong><em>Tagatupad/Those Who Carry On</em></strong>, on the eviction of International Hotel residents in San Francisco; and <strong><em>Ti Manyuna/Those Who Led the Way</em></strong>, on the Filipino labor community in Hawaii. Burns underlines the following strategies employed by the group: narratives that show the triumph of collective struggle against oppressive forces, as informed by Augusto Boal&rsquo;s theater of the oppressed; shifts in action when actors address audience members, making them central to the play; defamiliarization of popular culture; and negotiations of space (75-94).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly influenced by the framework that theater plays a role in the Filipino people&rsquo;s struggles, Teatro ng Tanan was formed in San Francisco in 1989. With the leadership of key artists Chris Millado, Julia Camagong, Mara Torres, Marlette and Bingo Marasigan, guest director Edgardo de la Cruz, and later, Allan Manalo, the group produced the collectively written <strong><em>Kin/Kamag-anak</em></strong>, 1989, on identity, immigration, and activism; Rene Villanueva&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/522\"><strong>Botong</strong></a></em></strong>, 1991, on the life of National Artist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3550\">Carlos V. Francisco</a>; and Chris Millado&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><strong>PeregriNasyon</strong> </em>, 1993, on the parallel lives of farmers and farmworkers in the Philippines and the United States during the American colonial period. The company disbanded in the mid-1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The influence of the national democratic movement endures, however, as seen not only in professional groups such as Ma-yi Theatre Company but also in loosely organized cultural groups and networks affiliated with larger political organizations. Two examples are Linangan Cultural Network in the Netherlands and LIKHA Filipino Migrants Organization in Hong Kong. Linangan Cultural Network, formerly People&rsquo;s Artist Network, was formed in 2006 by former PETA artists Jun Saturay and Mitchy Mallorca Saturay, and Netherlands-based Irish artist Martin Travers. Many of its members are Netherlands residents with different ethnic backgrounds: Poojah Pant (Nepali), Guney Brusk (Kurdish), Denise Yildirim (Dutch-Kurdish), and the Saturay children Nwel, Hiyasmin, Ilena, and Marikit (Filipino). Informed by strategies of street theater such as the use of giant puppets, clowning and mimicry, and reenactments, the network has articulated issues such as human rights, immigrant rights, and geopolitics through <strong><em>Checkpoint 101</em></strong>, 2007, a presentation on the Apartheid Wall in Palestine; <strong><em>A Sad State of Freedom</em></strong>, 2007, a street dramatization of Nazim Hikmet&rsquo;s poem, focusing on human rights in the Philippines, the Abu Gharaib prison, and Palestine; <strong><em>Grieving Mothers</em></strong>, 2010, a mask/movement theater piece on poverty, injustice, and human rights during the term of President Benigno Aquino III, performed in Amsterdam; an untitled giant puppet play performed on International Workers&rsquo; Day, 1 May 2011, in Rotterdam; and <strong><em>Kapi&rsquo;s Magic Trick</em></strong>, 2014, a clown act on workers&rsquo; struggles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LIKHA Filipino Migrants Cultural Organization, an affiliate of United Filipinos in Hong Kong, Migrante&ndash;HK, and BAYAN (Bagong Alyansang Makabayan)&ndash;Hong Kong and Macao, was established in 1992 but became inactive for many years until it was reactivated in 2006. Since most of its members are domestic workers and migrant organizers like Aaron Ceradoy, Shiela Tebia, Aurelia Gatchalian, Maricel Redita, Karen Garcia, Lalyn Lopez, and Jezelle Mendez, its performances tackle issues on the intersections of labor, migration, and gender: <strong><em>Binibining OWW</em></strong> <em>A</em>(Miss OWWA), 2003; <strong><em>Si Maria sa Mga Kuko ng Ahensiya</em></strong> (Maria in the Claws of the Agency), 2014; and <strong><em><strong>Balagtasan</strong>: Lagay ng <strong>Mama</strong>mayan</em></strong> (Verbal Joust: the Conditions of Citizens), 2014; and several dance movement interpretations of songs such as &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/856\">Babae Ka</a>&rdquo; (You Are a Woman) and &ldquo;Manggagawa&rdquo; (Worker).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labor and women&rsquo;s issues are also presented in the United States through occasional and annual productions by groups such as the Committee for the Protection of Workers&rsquo; Rights (CPWR), a support group of Kilusang Mayo Uno in the Philippines, and General Assembly Binding Women for Reforms, Integrity, Equality, Leadership, and Action (GABRIELA) USA, the US chapter of GABRIELA Philippines. In 2011, CPWR&rsquo;s artists Pendong and Cynthia Aban of the musical group Ang Grupong Pendong composed and performed <strong><em>Piketlayn Cantata</em></strong> (Picket Line Cantata) on the parallel struggles of caregivers and DOLE pineapple plantation workers. The play was restaged by Pintig in 2015. Annually since 2002, GABRIELA&rsquo;s chapters in the United States, such as FIRE in New York and Babae in San Francisco, have mounted <strong><em>Diwang Pinay</em></strong> (Spirit of the Filipina), which consists of songs, dances, short films, and short plays. Among the themes <strong><em>Diwang Pinay</em></strong> has tackled through the years are &ldquo;Kilos Kababaihan: Hearts Beating for the Movement&rdquo; (Women&rsquo;s Movement: Hearts Beating for the Movement), 2012; &ldquo;Labanan ang Pang-aapi sa Ating mga Makabagong Bayani&rdquo; (Resist the Enslavement of Our Modern Heroes), 2013; and &ldquo;Kasaysayan ng Kababaihang Migranteng Manggagawa&rdquo; (The Story of the Woman Migrant Worker), 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"individual\" name=\"individual\"></a>Individual Artists</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater work by Filipinos is not limited to organizations or companies, as established theater artists in the Philippines have continued their work in their sites of migration. One example is <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan</a>, a professor of theater at the University of Notre Dame, who has directed Oscar Wilde&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Salome</strong></em></strong>, 2006, using the Japanese kabuki theater form and the<em>pangalay</em>dance; Griselda Gambaro&rsquo;s <strong><em>Antigona Furiosa</em></strong>, 2011, a play that retells Sophocles&rsquo;s <strong><em>Antigone</em></strong>; and his own play <strong><em>Shadows of the Reef</em></strong>, 2013, which uses Lenten rites of crucifixions and flagellations in the Philippines as metaphors for poverty and suffering, the plight of children working as sea divers, and the exploitation of women. Active both in the international theater community and in local concerns, Juan is a board member of the International Playwrights&rsquo; Forum and has spearheaded the Theatre and Social Concerns project with juvenile prison residents, for which he received the Center for Social Concerns Award for social engagement. Before coming to the United States, Juan was also the founding artistic director of Step of Angels Theatre in Athens, Greece.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other professional and community-based theater artists who have worked or are still working in the United States are Arcenas, Obispo, Valdez, and Katigbak who are based in New York; designer Clint Ramos; actor Bernardo Bernardo, based in Los Angeles; theater professor and director Edgardo de la Cruz who taught at California State University East Bay; former <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> artistic director <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2969\">Herbert Go</a>, and actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3115\">Olga Natividad</a>; former PETA member <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3069\">Bing Magtoto</a>; former UP professor <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3149\">Nenita Pambid</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">UP Repertory Company</a> alumni Elena Buensalido Mangahas and Boots Pascual; and former DUP members Joseph Pe and Margaret Guzman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater artists have also been active in many other countries, whether as temporary migrants or immigrants. Theater actress Monique Wilson, who played Kim in <strong><em>Miss Saigon</em></strong> from 1989 to 1992, stayed on in London for a few years after graduating with a master&rsquo;s degree from the Central School of Speech and Drama to teach in the drama school. In London, Wilson also performed as Juliet in <strong><em><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></em></strong>, Anne in <strong><em>Richard III</em></strong>, Cleopatra in <strong><em>Anthony and Cleopatra</em></strong>, Marjorie in <strong><em>The Country Wife</em></strong>, and Vittoria in <strong><em>The White Devil</em></strong>. In France, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3042\">Connie Chua</a> started her theater work by directing <strong><em>Kutsilyo, Pamaypay and Yantok</em></strong> (Knife, Fan, and Stick), 2007 and 2012, for the Episcopal Church of Saint Paul, and youth plays, and by giving theater, dance, and music workshops. She has recently been involved in the use of theater to articulate the rights of domestic workers and empower them. Based in Germany, actor-singer Lanie Sumalinog has performed not only as Kim in <strong><em>Miss Saigon</em></strong>, but also in <strong><em>Les Miserables</em></strong>, 1998, and <strong><em>Wicked</em></strong>, 2007.

Burns also explained that although Ermena Vinluan was the driving force, crucial to the creative process of the group was collective work, thereby challenging mainstream theater processes. Among the group&#x2019;s works cited by Burns are <strong><em>Isuda ti Imunal/They Who Were First</em></strong>, which focused on Filipino migrant workers; <strong><em>Warbrides</em></strong>, on Filipina war brides; <strong><em>Mindanao</em></strong>, on Southern Philippines; <strong><em><strong>Sakada</strong></em></strong>, on peasant workers; <strong><em>Narciso and Perez</em></strong>, on two Filipina nurses who were victims of racism; <strong><em>Tagatupad/Those Who Carry On</em></strong>, on the eviction of International Hotel residents in San Francisco; and <strong><em>Ti Manyuna/Those Who Led the Way</em></strong>, on the Filipino labor community in Hawaii. Burns underlines the following strategies employed by the group: narratives that show the triumph of collective struggle against oppressive forces, as informed by Augusto Boal&#x2019;s theater of the oppressed; shifts in action when actors address audience members, making them central to the play; defamiliarization of popular culture; and negotiations of space (75-94)."

Active both in the international theater community and in local concerns, Juan is a board member of the International Playwrights&#x2019; Forum and has spearheaded the Theatre and Social Concerns project with juvenile prison residents, for which he received the Center for Social Concerns Award for social engagement.

In London, Wilson also performed as Juliet in <strong><em><strong>Romeo and Juliet</strong></em></strong>, Anne in <strong><em>Richard III</em></strong>, Cleopatra in <strong><em>Anthony and Cleopatra</em></strong>, Marjorie in <strong><em>The Country Wife</em></strong>, and Vittoria in <strong><em>The White Devil</em></strong>.

		"text": "<p>The sources for drama plots and characters, and styles of presentation in Philippine theater include history, folklore, foreign and indigenized literature, global theater trends and styles, and Philippine lifeways and real-life events. All of these are rich material for theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> and dances of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/432\">indigenous theater</a> evolved from day-to-day needs: rice planting and harvest, birth and death, courtship and marriage, illness, and rites of passage. They therefore drew from events and belief in the symbolic and actual characters and actions that made the ritual. The <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a> rice-planting ritual called <strong>kashawing</strong>, for example, uses food and water, farmers and intercessors, along with invocations and offerings to the spirits. Dances mime occupations like fishing, hunting, and fruit gathering, as well as rites of survival like battle and courtship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> has plots and characters from medieval European romances&mdash;from Britain and France, from Spanish and Portuguese history and lore, from the lives of saints, and from combinations of these. From these materials come the&nbsp;<em>buhay&nbsp;</em><em>na pinagdaanan&nbsp;</em>(the life history) of characters such as Principe Baldovino, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1864\">Doce Pares de Francia</a>, Prinsipe Atamante, Rodrigo de Villa, Haring Villarba, and Don Juan Ti&ntilde;oso. These stories were taken directly from the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a>s probably brought in by Spanish soldiers, written in the native languages in the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido</em>, read and chanted in the different regions and languages, and then transformed into drama by enactment on stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> and other religious dramas and dramatizations of the Spanish colonial period draw mainly from the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\">pasyon</a>&nbsp;</em>and the Bible, but also from related and apocryphal writings. The elaborate <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a>, for example, is built on the supposed meeting of Jesus and Mary after the Resurrection, which is not recorded in the gospels. The sinakulo fleshes out eight days of performances with Biblical narratives from the Creation to the Assumption of Mary into Heaven, as well as vignettes from the awit and korido, magazine stories, and folk belief about such characters as Dimas and Gestas, Boanerhes and Samuel Belibet, Veronica and Simon Cirineo, Virgen Maria and Pedro and Judas. From the search for the Holy Cross have been spun plays and romances involving the empress Elena and the emperor Constantino and characters from the Old and New Testaments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real life strides onstage in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, which depart from the Spanish models by building theater around the Filipino family: parents and children obedient or otherwise; husbands and wives in conflict or cooperation; their vices like cockfighting and&nbsp;<em>panggingge&nbsp;</em>(card game); concerns like politics, courtship, marriage, and making a living; and tensions between lover and beloved, landlord and tenant, master and servant, employer and employee. Although these situations were often modulated into the happy endings devoutly wished by both writers and viewers, they were based on daily life and in sum are often social comedies and commentaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sources for modern drama start with real life&mdash;day-to-day happenings witnessed or heard about, accounts in newspapers and magazines, news heard over the radio or on television, political and social experience. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3148\">Manny D. Pambid</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Buhay <strong>Bati</strong>lyo, Hindi Kami Susuko</em></strong> (Batilyo Life, We Will Not Surrender), 1975, was based on a <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5326\">Fanny A. Garcia</a> feature article about the life of a&nbsp;<em>batilyo&nbsp;</em>(fish stevedore) in the Navotas fish port. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/607\"><strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno Atbp. Kabanata</em></strong></a> (May 21 and Other Chapters), 1977, came from the real-life experiences of Valentin de los Santos and the massacre of the Lapiang Malaya. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/573\"><strong><em>Juan Tamban</em></strong></a>, 1978, started with a news item in the papers about a boy who fell ill from eating insects that triggered curiosity and research and resulted in a full-length play. Jacob&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/593\"><strong><em>Macliing Dulag</em></strong></a>, 1988, dramatizes the life of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a> leader who was assassinated for his opposition to the Chico River Dam Project. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2725\">Reuel Molina </a><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1099\">Aguila</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/596\"><strong><em>Walang <strong>Maliw</strong></em></strong></a> (Unfading), 2009, draws parallelisms from Jonas Burgos&rsquo;s abduction in 2007 and proves that political disappearances happened not only during martial law but continues to the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>History, being the &ldquo;real life&rdquo; of the past, has been a rich lode that contemporary Philippine theater has mined well, especially during the martial law era, when the only safe way to speak of the present was to present the past as seen in plays on the Philippine Revolution against Spain, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Katipunan: Mga <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ng Bayan</em></strong> (Katipunan: Children of the People), 1978, and <strong><em>Langit Ma&rsquo;y&nbsp;</em><em>Magdilim</em></strong> (Though the Sky Darkens), 1979.

Fictive life presents transformed or imagined experience, which in the translation into enacted fiction or drama is further transformed and enriched. Folklore is an endless and endlessly rich source because it includes myths&mdash;the imagined history of the race&mdash;and legends, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1549\">epics</a>, tales, folk life, and lore. It is a long-running tradition with bases in all ethnic groups and has been a rich source for theater. Folktales have provided plots and characters for such plays as <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2919\">Jean Garrot Edades</a> and Charlotte Chorpenning&rsquo;s play for children, <strong><em>Juan and the Magic Fruit</em></strong>, 1949; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5276\">Mig Alvarez Enriquez</a>&rsquo;s epics for stage, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a></em></strong>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></a></em></strong>, and <strong><em>Bantugan</em></strong>, 1953; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2943\">Alberto Florentino</a>&rsquo;s adaptation of <strong><em>The Legend of <strong>Mariang Makiling</strong></em></strong>, 1956; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3039\">Jose Lardizabal</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dularawan: Salakot na Ginto</em></strong> (Image Play: The Golden Salakot), 1969, a pageant written for the inauguration of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, which, like <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5252\">Ricaredo Demetillo</a>&rsquo;s award-winning <strong><em>The Heart of Emptiness Is Black</em></strong>, 1975, draws from the story of the 10 datus of Borneo (which incidentally was adjudged folklore rather than history by the Maragtas Symposium); and Al Santos&rsquo;s <strong><em>Si Juan Tamad vs Paltos V</em></strong> (Lazy Juan vs Paltos V), 1979. Bienvenido Portugal&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bidasari</em></strong>, 1988, draws its material from the Maranao epic <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></em></strong>, examining the concept of heroism while highlighting the value of collective action toward change. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2937\">Steven Patrick Fernandez</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ranaw: Isang Alamat</em></strong> (Ranaw: A Legend), 1986, is about the hero Bato Lakungan who was said to be the ancestor of Iliganons, Maranaos, Maguindanons, and Higaonons. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3163\">Edward Perez</a>&rsquo; <strong><em>Baloy</em></strong> <em>!</em>, 1988, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/115\"><strong>Ang Babaylan</strong></a></em></strong> (The Shaman), 1989, are based on Panay legends and folklore. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3175\">Nicolas Pichay</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hudhud: An <strong>Ifugao</strong> Romance</em></strong>, 2004, is a contemporary adaptation of the epic of the Ifugao&mdash;specifically, the first episode titled &ldquo;The Filling of the Scabbard,&rdquo; as told and chanted by Apu Baket, an 80-year-old Ifugao woman. Nicanor G. Tiongson&rsquo;s <strong><em>Labaw Donggon</em></strong>, 2013, is a musical adaptation of the Panay epic that fuses the indigenous and the contemporary as seen in the costumes, music, and dance. Rody Vera adapted the Bikol epic in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/561\"><strong><em>Ibalong</em></strong></a>, 2013, by creating a dance-musical using neoethnic rock to bring the material closer to the younger generation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folklore contributed more than just stories to the plays of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a> of Marawi City. <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/613\"><strong>Mga Kuwentong Maranao</strong></a></em></strong> (Maranao Tales), 1974, integrates 13 folktales about the trickster Pilandok. The literary material was merged by author-director <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3214\">Frank Rivera</a> with other folk elements&mdash;the&nbsp;<em>bayok&nbsp;</em>or verse debate, dances, and songs&mdash;to produce a unique theater distilled from Maranao folk culture. He included the&nbsp;<em>malong&nbsp;</em>(a piece of clothing that is a &ldquo;wall&rdquo; creating privacy) as costume/scenery/prop color statement; motifs and visuals from folk art; movements from folk dance and martial arts; and the bayok as chorus and dialogue. The success of the play&mdash;370 performances in the first eight years&mdash;shows how rich a mine and how effective a theater vehicle folklore can be. Sining Kambayoka produced more plays based on folklore such as <strong><em>Isang Alamat ng <strong>Sarimanok</strong></em></strong> (A Legend of Sarimanok), 1974; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1899\"><strong>Maharadia Lawana</strong></a></em></strong>, 1977, a dramatization of the epic; and <strong><em>Ang Paglalakbay ni&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Radiya Mangandiri</em></strong> (Rajah Mangandiri&rsquo;s Journey), 1993, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">PETA</a>&rsquo;s adaptation of the same epic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A number of plays for children are based on folk material. These include <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Manok at ang Lawin</em></strong> (The Chicken and the Hawk), <strong><em>Ang Magkakapatid at ang Tsonggo</em></strong> (The Siblings and the Monkey), and <strong><em>Kung Paano Pinatay ng mga Ibaloi ang&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Higante</em></strong> (How the Ibaloi Killed the Giant), all staged in 1974, as well as her puppet play <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/500\"><strong><em>Abadeja: Ang Ating Sinderela</em></strong></a> (Abadeja: Our Own Cinderella), 1977; and plays written by Bienvenido Portugal like <strong><em>Korido</em></strong>, 1987, which features characters like Don Juan Te&ntilde;oso, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1849\">Bernardo Carpio</a>, Mariang Kalabasa, and <strong><em>Bidasari</em></strong>, 1988, which is based on the epics <strong><em>Indarapatra at Sulayman</em></strong> (Indarapatra and Sulayman) and <strong><em>Darangen</em></strong>. Folk literature is also the source of Christine Bellen&rsquo;s <strong><em>Si Pilandok at ang Bayan ng <strong>Bulawan</strong></em></strong> (Pilandok and the Town of Gold), 2010; Liza Magtoto&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dugtong-Dugtong na Sumbong</em></strong> (Series of Complaints), 2010; and Arthur Cassanova&rsquo;s <strong><em>Si Kusog at ang Mahiwagang Bakawan</em></strong> (Kusog and the Magic Mangrove), <strong><em>Ang Paglilitis sa Hukuman ni Sinukuan</em></strong> (The Trial in the Court of Sinukuan), <strong><em>Ang Mahiwagang Tandang</em></strong> (The Magic Rooster), <strong><em>Si Diwatakasalipan at si Tarabuasao</em></strong> (Diwatakasalipan and Tarabuasao), and <strong><em>Si Juan Bahag</em></strong> (Loincloth Juan), all presented in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From folklore too have come motifs in such diverse plays as Jose Rizal&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/575\"><strong><em>Junto al Pasig</em></strong></a> (Beside the Pasig), 1880, which features the precolonial Diwata, and Domingo Landicho&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/541\"><strong><em>Dupluhang Bayan</em></strong></a> (People&rsquo;s Poetic Joust), 1975, which uses folk legends, like the creation of the brown man and of the first man and woman, and the fable of the monkey and the turtle, as breaks and illustrations between the&nbsp;<em>manggagawa-magsasaka&nbsp;</em>(laborer-farmer) verse debates in the manner of the<em>duplo</em>. The libretto of Bienvenido Lumbera&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/193\"><strong><em>Tales of the Manuvu</em></strong></a>, 1977, draws from Manuvu creation and other myths collected by anthropologist <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\">E. Arsenio Manuel</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Folk life and customs have been sources for such plays as Al Santos and Nic Cleto&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bodong</em></strong>, 1976, which is about the peace pact of the Cordilleras; Al Santos, Rody Vera, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2567\">Denisa Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/136\"><strong>Diablos</strong></a></em></strong> (Demons), 1989, which creates dance drama from ritual; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3009\">Reynaldo &ldquo;Tootsie&rdquo; Jamoralin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/660\"><strong><em>Si Bulusan nan si Agingay</em></strong></a> (Bulusan and Agingay), 1990, which draws from <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> folklore and utilizes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/79\"><em>pantomina</em></a>, a local courtship dance to highlight the celebration of love between the two characters; and Al Santos, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala,</a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2516\">Agnes Locsin</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/138\"><strong>Encantada</strong></a></em></strong> (Enchantress), 1992, which blends folk belief, ritual, faith, music, and lifeways into dance and drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays based on folklore have used single characters, single stories, story cycles, scenes, values&mdash;retold, embellished, reinvented. They appeal because they draw from the wells of community memory, tradition, and consciousness&mdash;they are not just characters and situations but ways of being, seeing, and doing as well. Folklore is, after all, the first chapter of a people&rsquo;s history and of a nation&rsquo;s communal story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The&nbsp;<em>pasyon</em>, although strictly speaking not borne out of our folk tradition, being of Biblical origin, has functioned as folk material and is an important source for Philippine drama. From it came not only the sinakulo as written by the folk writers in the different regions but also the Mary (i.e., the compleat, the suffering mother), Magdalene (i.e, the reformed woman and the &ldquo;prostitute with the golden heart&rdquo; archetype), and Christ (i.e., the suffering savior) figures of fiction and drama, which are all found in the sarsuwela and the drama, as well as in modern plays and films. The Christ story has also been the source of such plays as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/510\"><strong><em>Bagong Cristo</em></strong></a> (New Christ), 1907, and the contemporary sinakulo with Christ as farmer, fisher, or one of the urban poor. Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/641\"><strong>Papet Pasyon</strong></a></em></strong> (The Passion of Christ in Puppetry) adapted and Filipinized the story of Jesus for the young Filipino audiences. It has been staged every Palm Sunday since 1985 by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a>, not only to make the young audiences grasp the meaning of the life and sufferings of Jesus but also to depict Filipino culture and traditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The awit and korido, which bred the komedya, also resulted in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Rio Alma</a> and Tito Climaco&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock</a> <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musical</a> <strong><em>Bernardo Carpio</em></strong>, 1976; Rene O.

Both have been made into operas and films.<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3965\"> Felipe Padilla de Leon</a> composed the opera <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a>, with lyrics by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3802\">Guillermo Tolentino</a> in 1953, and <strong><em><strong><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></strong></em></strong> in 1970. <strong><em>Noli</em></strong> has been adapted by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2942\">Jomar Fleras</a> into <strong><em>Kanser</em></strong> (Cancer), 1980, one of the most often performed numbers in the repertory of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a>. Bienvenido Lumbera created the libretto of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/625\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere: The Musical</strong></a></em></strong>, 2011, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a>. In the year of the <strong><em>Fili</em></strong> centenary in 1991, Floy Quintos&rsquo;s <strong><em>Fili</em></strong>, Jose Bernard Capino&rsquo;s <strong><em>Filibustero</em></strong> (Filibuster), and <strong><em>El Filibusterismo:&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>The Musical</em></strong> by Paul Dumol and Jovy Miroy, with music by Ryan Cayabyab, were staged. In 1995, Quintos adapted the <strong><em>Fili</em></strong> again in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/568\"><strong>Isang Panaginip na Fili</strong></a></em></strong> (A Dreamed&nbsp;<em>Fili</em>), 2008. Nicanor G. Tiongson created <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/624\"><strong><em>Noli at Fili Dekada 2000</em></strong></a> (<em>Noli&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fili&nbsp;</em>in the Decade of the 2000s), 2008, which, while adhering to the structure of Rizal&rsquo;s novels, highlights pressing sociopolitical issues in the early 2000s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stories from <strong><em>Fili</em></strong> had earlier been retold in Paul Dumol&rsquo;s powerful three-act play <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/576\"><strong><em>Kabesang Tales</em></strong></a> (Cabeza Tales), 1975, in which 27 scenes in <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/444\">Brechtian</a> style present the conflict between the peasant Tales and the friar, and the situation that made him turn to violence. Sisa from <strong><em>Noli</em></strong> has been the subject of Rosauro dela Cruz&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Misteryo ng&nbsp;</em><em>Hapis ni Sisa</em></strong> (The Mystery of Sisa&rsquo;s Suffering), 1975, and a noh play by Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/633\"><strong><em>Ang Paglalakbay ni Sisa: Isang Noh sa Laguna</em></strong></a> (Sisa&rsquo;s Quest: A Noh in Laguna), 1976. Sisa joins Maria Clara and Salome, two other women from the novels, in Chris Millado and Nick Pichay&rsquo;s three one-act plays, <strong><em>Kutsilyo</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pamaypay</em>,&nbsp;<em>at Yantok</em></strong> (Knife, Fan, and Cane), 1984, which all take the woman&rsquo;s perspective&mdash;a viewpoint from which few plays in the Philippine repertoire have been written. Floy Quintos reinterprets the character of Maria Clara in <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/672\"><strong>Suor Clara</strong></a></em></strong>, 2010, by transforming her from the novel&rsquo;s submissive individual into an empowered woman. Many readers take the Rizal novels as history; so perhaps do the writers of plays. Playwrights do find some of their work already done for them, since Rizal had already vividly described and fleshed out the people and the places of his historical milieu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other examples of the use of literary sources by Philippine playwrights include <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5783\">Wilfredo Virtusio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Vida</em></strong>, 1969, which has, as one of the principal characters, an old man named Selo, who obviously refers to the Tata Selo in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5698\">Rogelio Sicat</a>&rsquo;s famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1560\">short story</a> who in turn seems to draw his name and much of his anger from Selo, the father of Tales in <strong><em>Fili</em></strong>. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a> himself turned his story &ldquo;Three Generations&rdquo; into <strong><em>Fathers and Sons</em></strong>, performed in translation as <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/608\"><strong><em>Mga Ama, Mga Anak</em></strong></a>, 1977, and his <strong><em>Summer Solstice</em></strong> into the play <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/675\"><strong><em>Tatarin</em></strong></a>, 1978. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5400\">Stevan Javellana</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Without Seeing the Dawn</em></strong> became the play <strong><em>Silang Nalugmok sa Dilim</em></strong> (Those Who Fell in the Dark), 1984, by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3079\">Dennis Marasigan</a>.

The art of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3634\">Juan Luna</a>, for example, is a central motif in Bienvenido Noriega Jr&rsquo;s <strong><em>Juan&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Luna</em></strong>, 1982, while that of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3550\">Carlos &ldquo;Botong&rdquo; Francisco</a> is evident in Rene O.

Hernandez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular culture&mdash;such as films, music, comic books, and graphic novels&mdash;is one of the most prevalent sources of plays, as theater artists make the most of the audiences&rsquo; familiarity with the source material. Manny Pambid wrote <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/527\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Canuplin</strong></strong>: Isang Improbisasyon sa Buhay at Mga Palabas ng Isang <strong>Komedya</strong>nteng Pilipino</em></strong></a> (Canuplin: An Improvisation on the Life and Shows of a Filipino Comedian), 1980, about the life of Canuto Francia, Filipino&nbsp;stage performer and magician who became famous for his impersonation of Charlie Chaplin&nbsp;in Filipino movies and the local&nbsp;bodabil stage. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a> wrote <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></em></strong>, 2002, based on the classic film, which was originally a teleplay he wrote in 1973 for the television series <strong><em>Hilda</em></strong>. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4510\">Ricky Lee</a> wrote the script and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4378\">Vince de Jesus</a> created the musical compositions of <strong><em><strong>Himala</strong>: The Musical</em></strong>, 2003, based on the film <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1178\"><strong><em>Himala</em></strong></a> (<strong><em>Miracle</em></strong>). <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4539\">Chris Martinez</a> wrote <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/692\"><strong>Zsazsa Zaturnnah Ze Muzikal</strong></a></em></strong>, 2004, based on Carlo Vergara&rsquo;s graphic novel <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1758\"><strong><em>Ang Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Zsazsa Zaturnnah</em></strong></a> (The Amazing Adventures of Zsazsa Zaturnnah).

Ed Maranan&rsquo;s <strong><em>EJ: Ang Pinagdaanang Buhay nina Evelio Javier at Edgar Jopson</em></strong> (EJ: The Lives of Evelio Javier and Edgar Jopson), 2008, used songs by the rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\">The Dawn</a>. <strong><em>Sa Wakas</em></strong> (At Last), 2013, was created by Andre Nicolai Pamintuan and Marianne Abuan using songs by rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4184\">Sugarfree</a>. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/647\"><strong><em>Rak of <strong><strong>Aegis</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, 2014, by Liza Magtoto featured the songs by rock band <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3855\">Aegis</a>. <strong><em>Chuva Choo Choo: The Mr. Kupido Musicale</em></strong>, 2015, by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2874\">George de Jesus III</a>, used songs by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4167\">Vehnee Saturno</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Theater styles and trends from East and West have also been sources for theater. Brechtian theater, for example, resulted not only in successful and effective translations and adaptations, such as <strong><em>Ang Pabilog na Guhit na Tisa</em></strong>, 1977, from <strong><em>The Caucasian Chalk Circle</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Ang Buhay ni Galileo</em></strong>, 1981, from <strong><em>Galileo Galilei</em></strong>, but also in plays using the approach and/or the techniques of epic theater. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando S.Tinio</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/605\"><strong><em>May Katwiran ang Katwiran</em></strong></a> (Reason Has Its Reason), 1972, has been eminently successful in teaching Brechtian theater. Paul Dumol&rsquo;s Brechtian approach in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/635\"><strong><em>Ang Paglilitis ni Mang Serapio</em></strong></a> (The Trial of Old Serapio), 1968, and <strong><em><strong>Kabesang Tales</strong></em></strong>, 1975, have proven its effectivity in the Philippine situation. Other plays that were influenced by the theater philosophy and works of Brecht are Al Santos&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mayo A-Beinte Uno Atbp. Kabanata</em></strong> (May 21 and Other Chapters), 1977; Bonifacio Ilagan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Estados Unidos bersus Cruz</em></strong>, <strong><em>Abad at Tolentino</em></strong> (United States versus Cruz, Abad and Tolentino), 1981; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2889\">Dong del os Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bien Aligtad</em></strong>, 1985; and Jose Y. Dalisay Jr&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Butihing Babae ng Timog</em></strong> (The Good Woman of the South), 1992. Brechtian elements also characterize Ateneo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2921\">ENTABLADO</a> productions such as <strong><em>Sampung Mga Daliri</em></strong> (Ten Fingers), 2010; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/573\"><strong>Juan Tamban</strong></a></em></strong>, 2013; <strong><em>Isang Gabi, FB na Mapanglaw</em></strong> (One Night, A Solitary FB), 2014; and <strong><em>Gulo ng Gugulong na Ulo</em></strong> (Trouble from a Head Roll), 2015. Augusto Boal&rsquo;s Theater of the Oppressed has also been used in the short image and forum theater pieces by groups such as the Philippine Educational Theater Association and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3166\">Peryante</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\">realism</a> developed in Western literature is seen early in the sarsuwela and drama of the first decades of Philippine theater, and has grown strong in contemporary theater. The social realism of many plays during the martial law era, like <strong><em>Juan Tamban</em></strong> and&nbsp;<em><strong>Buhay Batilyo</strong> </em>, draws the individual in the context of society, and thus renders his reality. Rene O. Villanueva&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Hiblang Abo</strong></em></strong> (Strands of Gray), 1980, which focuses on the lives of four male residents of a home for the aged, used modern realism to reflect on the theme of conflict and death. The psychological realism of plays like Tony Perez&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/519\"><strong><em>Biyaheng Timog</em></strong></a> (Trip to the South), 1984; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/651\"><strong><em>Sa&nbsp;</em><em>North Diversion Road</em></strong></a> (On the North Diversion Road), 1988; <strong><em>Oktubre, Noong Tayo&rsquo;y Nagmamahalan Pa</em></strong> (October, When We Were Still in Love), 1993; and <strong><em>Nobyembre, Noong Akala Ko&rsquo;y Mahal Kita</em></strong> (November, When I Thought I Love You), 1994, portray the individual as a product of his inner landscape, which thus renders his humanity. Floy Quintos&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/545\"><strong>Fake</strong></a></em></strong>, 2011, examines the last days of Jose Marco, who successfully foisted his forgeries of the Code of Kalantiao and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/928\"><strong>La Loba Negra</strong></a></em></strong> (The Black She-Wolf) on the public until his fraud was exposed by historian Henry Scott.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the sources are varied and numerous, influences on Philippine theater are many and deep. The influence of Spanish literature, both religious and secular, and theater produced the content and style of all the religious dramas and dramatizations, the komedya, and later the sarsuwela and the drama. Although these forms have already been studied in theses, articles, and books, further explorations into them and into Spanish theater keep turning up more echoes and transmutations (e.g., the idea of the comic, the concept of villainy, the philosophy of staging, the romance mode, the honor principle, etc.) that suggest further study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anglo-American influences, which entered through the educational system, the English language, and popular culture, are seen in the idea of the legitimate theater, the content and style of modern and contemporary plays, stagecraft and acting and directorial techniques, stage technology, and the theatrical trends or movements tried, adapted, combined, and transmuted such as realism, expressionism, and the theater of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/440\">absurd</a>. Although these influences definitely dominate in Philippine theater, there have been inputs from other theaters as well, notably Japanese (kabuki, Noh, kyogen, Black Tent modern theater), Indonesian, Chinese (the Chinese opera performed in the provinces and sometimes referred to as &ldquo;<strong>Chinese moro-moro</strong>,&rdquo; the political plays of the Cultural Revolution), and European (mime, Brechtian theater).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these sources and influences have resulted in a philosophy of theater that is culture- and community-based, as was indigenous theater, but has been enriched through history by strands and branches that developed, by other concepts such as idea theater, teaching theater, social and politicaltheater, theater of awareness and conscientization, as well as by the need and purpose of the playwright and/or theater group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many other influences enter in different proportions and manners, what with the contemporary artist now on the global stage because of greater opportunities such as troupe tours, artist collaborations, attendance in international conferences, and workshops in other countries; and greater visibility as his or her accomplishments are easily disseminated nowadays. At the artist&rsquo;s core, however, are strong Malay (the native strain), Hispanic, and Anglo-American influences that are most visible especially when seen in contrast with the theater of Southeast Asian countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sources from which Philippine theater draws its substance remain predominantly local, as they should, since Philippine drama is Philippine life. Contemporary and historical events, current issues, folklore, literature, and the other arts have provided themes, motifs, characters, situations, values, even whole dramas. The particular combination of Philippine life and Hispanic and Anglo-American theater, forged by history and circumstance, is what makes Philippine theater uniquely Filipino.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.
