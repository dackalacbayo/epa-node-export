		"text": "<p>The <strong>absurd</strong> refers to a type of modern Philippine play influenced by the theater of the absurd of Samuel Beckett, Eugene Ionesco, Jean Genet, and others, whose situations are purposely exaggerated to prove a thesis and whose characters tend to become types rather than individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term was first used by Martin Esslin in his discussion of the type of drama associated with Beckett, Ionesco, Genet, Arthur Adamov, Harold Pinter, and other avant-garde writers in Europe and the United States. A product of post-World War II disenchantment and a reaction against &ldquo;middle-class realism,&rdquo; this is theater based on the premise of a world that is, in Ionesco&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;devoid of purpose,&rdquo; and the human being lost because &ldquo;cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots,&rdquo; and thus engaged in actions that are &ldquo;senseless, absurd, useless&rdquo; (Esslin 1972, 2-3). It is theater that presents the absurd in concrete images and situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The theater of the absurd reached the Philippine stage through translations of some of its landmark works: Beckett&rsquo;s <strong><em>Waiting for Godot</em></strong> and Ionesco&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Bald Soprano</em></strong>.The Beckett play, translated by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando S. Tinio</a> as <strong><em>Ang Paghihintay kay Godot</em></strong>, was first performed by Ateneo de Manila students in 1967. Ionesco&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Chairs</em></strong> was performed in English in 1970, while <strong><em>The Bald Soprano</em></strong> was adapted in Filipino by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5197\">Isagani R. Cruz</a> under the title <strong><em>Ang Tatay Mong Kalbo</em></strong>, 1969. Both were performed by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> and later by many other groups. Other plays of this nature performed by theater groups in Metro Manila in the 1970s and 1980s are Jean Genet&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Balcony</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Maids</em></strong>, Beckett&rsquo;s <strong><em>Endgame</em></strong>, Vaclav Havel&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Memorandum</em></strong>,and Edward Albee&rsquo;s <strong><em>Who&rsquo;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</em></strong> Through these plays, the &ldquo;sense of metaphysical anguish at the absurdity of the human condition&rdquo; (Esslin 1972, 23-24) reached playwrights and audiences who saw a related absurdity in Philippine poverty and oppression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>, in collaboration with UP Dulaang Laboratoryo, staged <strong><em>Haring Ubu</em></strong> (King Ubu), a Filipino adaptation of Alfred Jarry&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ubu Roi</em></strong>. In Oct 2014, the PETA hosted The Imaginarium: A Festival of the Absurd, a four-day multi-arts festival centered on the absurd, which showcased some of the best works in theater, such as The Sandbox Collective&rsquo;s production of Michael Kooman and Christopher Diamond&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dani Girl</em></strong>, Michael Lluberes and Joe Maloney&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicale</a> <strong><em>The Boy in the Bathroom</em></strong>; Guelan Varela Luarca&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mga Kuneho</em></strong> (The Rabbits); and Sipat Lawin Ensemble&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Return of the Comeback of the New and Improved Newly Scented Haring +Ubu-L! Now in 6-D!</em></strong>, an adaptation of Alfred Jarry&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ubu Roi</em></strong>, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elements of the absurd were first expressed in the works of the young playwrights of Ateneo High School&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a>; for example, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/635\"><strong><em>Ang Paglilitis ni Mang Serapio</em></strong></a> (The Trial of Old Serapio), 1968, in which beggars indict one of their own for caring (this being against federation rules, since it reduces effectivity), and blind him&mdash;to make hima better beggar. Although the high school playwrights could not be said to have experienced the &ldquo;divorce between man and his life, the actor and his setting, [which] truly constitutes the feeling of Absurdity&rdquo; (Esslin 1972, 23), they saw the absurd in the meaningless actions of grown-ups around them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3150\">Panday Sining</a>, a pre-martial law political theater group, wrote and staged <strong><em>Hukumang Tuwad</em></strong> (Kangaroo Court), 1971, which presented in an absurd fashion the litigation of the Progressive Class (Proletariat, Farmers, Workers, National Minorities, Students, Teachers, Gangsters, Prostitutes). They are accused of different &ldquo;crimes&rdquo; by the Reactionary Class (American Imperialists, Landlord-Compradors, Bureaucrat-Capitalists), who in the end are unmasked as being responsible for society&rsquo;s unjust structures. Rey E. Dela Cruz&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kumbensyon ng Mga <strong>Halimaw</strong></em></strong> (A Convention of Monsters), 1971, is a satire on the 1971 Constitutional Convention wherein creatures from Philippine folklore gather to discuss the Philippine Constitution and <strong><em>Kabaong ng Kalokohan</em></strong> (A Coffin of Nonsense), 1972, is described as a &ldquo;journey through the theater of the absurd,&rdquo; where two cross-dressing lunatics discuss different ways to die. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/666\"><strong><em>Ang Sistema ni Propesor Tuko</em></strong></a> (Professor Gecko&rsquo;s Way), 1980, presents rebellious students under a tyrannical teacher, who moonlights as a waiter, in an absurd educational system characterized by authoritarianism and colonial mentality. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3265\">Joshua Lim So</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/571\"><strong><em>Joe Cool: Aplikante</em></strong></a> (Joe Cool: Applicant), 2012, demonstrates the struggles of a man to secure a job through a rather outlandish application process, while dealing with a difficult receptionist. In 2015, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3283\">Tanghalang Ateneo</a> staged <strong><em>Godot<sup>5</sup>: Five Ruminations on Samuel Beckett&rsquo;s &lsquo;En Attendant Godot</em></strong>, <strong><em>&rsquo;</em></strong> wherein the characters are framed within five sets of adaptations&mdash;namely, &ldquo;Men Waiting,&rdquo; &ldquo;Women Waiting,&rdquo; &ldquo;College Graduates Waiting,&rdquo; &ldquo;Queer Folks Waiting,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old Folks Waiting.&rdquo; These and other works demonstrate the influence of the theater of the absurd on Philippine theater, especially in techniques of characterization.

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">The <b>balagtasan</b> is a poetic debate usually mounted on stage for the public audience. Although some scholars would classify the balagtasan as a poetic form, it is actually intended as a theater event with the key elements of the actor, audience, text, space, and context present. The usual process of staging the balagtasan covers many phases: agreement on the topic, writing of the script, memorizing the script, presentation of the balagtasan, and selection of the winning <b>mambabalagtas </b>(poet debater). The core actors include two mambabalagtas and a <b>lakandiwa</b> (mediator; <i>lakan</i> is a title of nobility, and <i>diwa</i> means mind). The audience is referred to as <b>bayang matino&rsquo;t makapangyarihan</b> (righteous and powerful people) since, traditionally, it is the viewing public that delivers the <b>hatol</b> (verdict or judgment) and declares the winner of the debate. Some of the criteria expected to be used in judging are <b>taas ng diwa </b>(intelligent arguments),<i> </i><b>linaw ng katwiran</b><i> </i>(clarity of reasoning), and <b>sarap ng salita</b><i> </i>(beauty of the language) (Zafra 2000, 307).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The balagtasan text is in the form of a script prepared by the two debating mambabalagtas. Sometimes a poet writes the entire script to be delivered by young or unskilled participants. The script centers on a single <b>paksa</b> (topic), usually on sociopolitical concerns or current issues. The topic is developed by enumerating and elucidating on several <b>katwiran</b> (reasons or arguments), which makes the balagtasan a form of <b>pangangatwiran</b> (argumentation) or <b>labanan ng katwiran</b> (battle of reasons). The katwiran may be based on anything&mdash;&ldquo;maaaring sumaklaw sa lahat ng dako ng buong daigdig&rdquo; (can cover anything in the world)&mdash;as long as it is delivered in poetic form and does not use inappropriate language (Zafra 2000, 305).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The debate proper usually follows this flow: the <b>panimula</b> (introduction) by the lakandiwa who introduces the mambabalagtas, the topic or <b>layunin </b>(objective), and the <b>batas na paiiralin</b> (rules to implement); <b>unang bulasan</b> (first attack), the delivery of the first set of arguments; <b>sagutan</b> (exchange of arguments), the series of delivery of arguments and rebuttal; and <b>paghahatol </b>(judgment). Sometimes, reminiscent of the <b>panawagan</b> (plea) of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><b>duplo</b></a> in which participants would make a plea so the <b>hari </b>(king) would allow him/her to enter the circle, a mambabalagtas, coming from the side of the audience, might make a similar plea for the lakandiwa to allow him/her to go up the stage. This is done to create that impromptu atmosphere of the debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the height of its popularity, the balagtasan was mounted in major theaters, like the Olympic Stadium, Opera House, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro<strong> </strong>Zorrilla</a>. In the succeeding decades, the grandstands in town plazas or platforms in schools became stages for the balagtasan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Contrary to popular belief, the form was not created by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Balagtas</a>, the foremost <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> poet, but was actually conceived in his honor. The balagtasan was born in a meeting on 28 Mar 1924 of the Kapulungang Balagtas, a society of writers and advocates of Tagalog, held at the Instituto de Mujeres, which was formerly located in Tayuman, Tondo, Manila. In the meeting, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5689\">Lope K. Santos</a> suggested the holding of a modern duplo to commemorate the birth anniversary of Balagtas. However, it was pointed out that staging a duplo would be inappropriate since it was more associated with death rituals. Patricio A. Dionisio suggested naming the presentation after Balagtas, but it was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5694\">Jose N. Sevilla</a> who coined the word &ldquo;balagtasan.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first balagtasan script was believed to have been written by Dionisio, who used the byline &ldquo;Ibig-Sumali-Kung-Maaari&rdquo; (One Who Would Participate). Titled <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\"><strong>Balagtasan</strong></a></i></b>, it was published in the weekly <b><i>Bagong</i></b> <b><i>Lipang <strong><strong>Kala</strong></strong>baw</i></b> on 5 Apr 1924 to serve as a model for balagtasan participants. There was a call for veteran and young poets alike to join the balagtasan event for the Balagtas celebration. There were three pairs of poets who responded and squared off against each other. Of the three, the pair of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5178\">Florentino T. Collantes</a>, who debated on the topic <b><i>Bulaklak ng Lahing Kalinis-linisan</i></b> (Flower of the Race Most Pure), was the most popular since both were accomplished poets, and de Jesus was the president of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5389\">Ilaw at Panitik</a> while Collantes was the head of Bulalakaw.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first balagtasan on stage was mounted at Instituto de Mujeres on 6 Apr 1924. De Jesus took on the role of Paruparo (Butterfly) while Collantes was Bubuyog (Bee). They were joined by Lope K. Santos as Lakandiwa and Sofia Enriquez as Kampupot (Jasmine). Also in the panel of judges were Rosa Sevilla-Alvero as Lakan-Ilaw (Grand Light) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5630\">I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado</a> as Gatpayo (Noble Adviser). The script of <b><i>Bulaklak ng Lahing Kalinis-linisan</i></b> was written by de Jesus and Collantes. They took turns in writing each side of the topic. This account proves that unlike its predecessor, the duplo, the balagtasan is scripted. Nevertheless, there is partial truth to the perception among audiences that it is extemporaneous. This happens when the topic has been tackled many times over by the same team of mambabalagtas such that the poets have already built an arsenal of arguments which they can readily draw from and use during the balagtasan even without much preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first staging of the balagtasan was well received by the public. The column Sariling Kuro of the newspaper <b><i>Ang Watawat</i></b> (The Flag) noted that the modification done on the duplo would greatly help in the development and propagation of the language of Balagtas. Such was the success of the De Jesus-Collantes tandem that the two poets debated again in public. After the first balagtasan, they argued on the topic <b><i>Magdaragat at Magbubukid </i></b>(Fisherman and Farmer). This balagtasan, in honor of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>, was staged at the Opera House in Avenida Rizal. Collantes defended Magdaragat and De Jesus, Magbubukid. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5619\">Benigno Ramos</a> served as Lakandiwa. One account states that this battle resulted in a rift between De Jesus and Collantes. In some part of the balagtasan, when Collantes was delivering his stanzas, De Jesus recited some lines that were not in the original script: &ldquo;<i>Kung hindi lang sa nariritong marilag na diwata/disin sana ang mukha mo&rsquo;y inabot ng aking sipa</i>&rdquo; (If not for the presence of these beautiful muses/I would have kicked your face). This remark drew applause and laughter from the crowd, spurring Collantes to think of a rebuttal. He replied to Batute: &ldquo;<i>O, kataka-taka&rsquo;t kahima-himala/may kabayo palang marunong tumula</i>&rdquo; (Oh, what a great surprise/a horse who can recite a poem). This drew more cheers from the audience. But despite the reception, Jesus and Collantes entered into a silent feud that lasted for three months. It was reported that a number of balagtasan invitations were turned down because of this disagreement. Since they needed to engage with each other for succeeding duels, they decided to reconcile with the help of writer friends. This is further proof of an element of spontaneity in the performance of the balagtasan despite the presence of a script, an element which can be expected from a form that belongs to the oral tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">De Jesus and Collantes debated again on the topic <b><i>Panganori&rsquo;t Alapaap </i></b>(Sky and the Cloud) staged at Teatro Zorrilla in Azcarraga, now <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5627\">Claro M. Recto</a> Avenue. Next was the <b><i><strong>Dalagang Pilipina</strong>: Noon at Ngayon </i></b>(The Filipina Maiden: Yesterday and Today) balagtasan, considered the biggest and the most popular among the poetic debates between De Jesus and Collantes. De Jesus defended the Filipina of Yesterday while Collantes, the Filipina of Today, with Manila Representative Francisco Varona as the Lakandiwa. It was staged at the Olympic Stadium on 18 Oct 1925. The audience included General Emilio Aguinaldo, senators, congressmen, and officials of Malaca&ntilde;an and universities. There were also delegations from Tayabas, Laguna, Cavite, Bataan, Rizal, and Bulacan among the audience. Newspaper reports estimated the crowd at 8,000 to 15,000. This balagtasan was adjudged by the audience, who voted for their favored poet by clapping. In this duel, De Jesus was honored as the first &ldquo;Hari ng Balagtasan&rdquo; (King of Balagtasan). The practice of bestowing the title &ldquo;Hari ng Balagtasan&rdquo; began with this encounter. It is important to note that the first Hari ng Balagtasan was chosen by the audience, which attests to its central role in staging most balagtasan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the balagtasan at the Olympic Stadium, De Jesus and Collantes battled again several times. In the <b><i>Panulat at Sandata </i></b>(Pen and Weapon) balagtasan, Collantes attempted to seize the title from De Jesus. The duel ended in a draw. Collantes succeeded in capturing the title when he defended the side of Anti-coalition against De Jesus&rsquo;s Coalition in the <b><i>Koalisyon at Anti-koalisyon</i></b><i> </i>(Coalition and Anti-coalition) balagtasan. This happened in 1927 when political groups were debating on the issue of forming a single political party. In 1929, De Jesus regained the title in the <b><i>Ginto at Bakal</i></b> (Gold and Metal) balagtasan, in which he argued for Bakal against Collantes&rsquo; Ginto. Collantes sought to reclaim the title but all attempts to have another duel failed, until De Jesus fell ill and never recovered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the height of balagtasan&rsquo;s popularity, almost all of the well-known writers took part in the balagtasan. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5330\">Pedro Gatmaitan</a> and Benigno Ramos fought over <b><i>Kung Sino ang Dapat Mahalin ng <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong>: Ama o Ina</i></b> (Who Should the Child Love: Father or Mother); Ramos and De Jesus over <b><i><strong>Independencia</strong> Laban sa Autonomia </i></b>(Independence versus Autonomy); De Jesus and Gatmaitan over <b><i>Sino ang Mahalaga, ang Nars o ang Maestra?</i></b> (Who Is More Important: Nurse or Teacher?); and Gatmaitan and Collantes over <b><i>Demokrata vs. Konsolidado </i></b>(Democrat vs Consolidated). Even women poets engaged in the balagtasan. On 6 Sep 1925, the Samahang Bulakan sponsored a balagtasan titled <b><i>Ilaw ng <strong>Bayani</strong></i></b> (Light of the Hero) to celebrate the birth anniversary of Marcelo H. del Pilar. It was mounted in Teatro Zorrilla. Epifania Alvarez defended <i>Liwayway</i> (Dawn), while Beatrice Pablo defended <i>Bituin</i> (Star). The script for this balagtasan was written by Collantes and De Jesus respectively (Gener 1948, 43). But the breakthrough balagtasan of women poets was enacted on 21 Mar 1926. Filomena T. Alcazar and Pilar Mayot debated on the topic <b><i>Bulaklak at Bituin </i></b>(Flower and Star).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Because of its popularity, the balagtasan spread to other Philippine language groups. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Kapampangan</a> developed the <b>crissotan,</b> named after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3269\">Juan Crisostomo Soto</a>, considered the Father of Kapampangan Literature. In the 1930s, the Ilocano had their own version of the balagtasan&mdash;the <b>bukanegan</b>,<b> </b>named after <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5134\">Pedro Bucaneg</a>, considered the &ldquo;Father of Ilocano Literature.&rdquo; As early as 1926, there were already reports of balagtasan events in Cebu using the Visayan language. The rapid spread of the balagtasan to other regions can be explained by the presence of a vibrant tradition of poetic jousts in many parts of the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The balagtasan was adopted even by Filipino writers in foreign languages. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5083\">Jesus Balmori</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5117\">Manuel Bernabe</a>, using the Spanish language, debated on the topics <b><i>El <strong>Recuerdo</strong> y El Olvido </i></b>(Memory and Forgetfulness),<b><i> El Hombre y La Mujer </i></b>(Man and Woman),<b><i> </i></b>and<b><i> La Ilusion y El Desenga&ntilde;o </i></b>(Illusion and Disillusion). Analyzing these balagtasan pieces written by Filipino poets in Spanish based on the poetics of Balagtasismo, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5187\">Coroza</a> concluded that the balagtasan in Spanish is not only an evidence of the popularity of the form but also of Filipino writers&rsquo; appropriation of the Spanish language (2010, 25).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Although the balagtasan is meant to be mounted on stage, it reached the newspapers and magazines since many of the mambabalagtas were also writer-journalists. The most significant of these balagtasan on print media was <b><i>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</i></b> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow) which appeared on the weekly <b><i>Sampagita</i></b>, from 10 Aug 1926 to 17 Dec 1926. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>, who argued for Bukas, overwhelmingly triumphed over I&ntilde;igo Ed. Regalado (Kahapon) and Benigno Ramos (Ngayon) through votes sent in by the readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1937, the Compania Elizalde, a pro-Filipino commercial house, sponsored the balagtasan on radio. This project, which lasted until 1941 and was revived from 1946 to 1956, was initiated by Pedro E. Teodoro, the director for publicity of the company, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5519\">Fernando B. Monleon</a>, the proponent. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5045\">Emilio Mar. Antonio</a> won the first balagtasan on radio with the topic <b><i>Sino ang Higit na Dapat Mahalin: Ina, Asawa, o Anak?</i></b> (Who Should be Loved Most: Mother, Spouse, or Child?), besting opponents Monleon and Francisco Pano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">After the death of Collantes in 1954, Antonio and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5159\">Nemesio Caravana</a> fought over the title Hari ng Balagtasan on the topic <b><i>Alin ang Lalong Mahalaga: Buhay Kahapon o Buhay Ngayon?</i></b> (Which Is More Significant: Life Yesterday or Life Today?). Antonio was crowned Hari ng Balagtasan by the Taliba ng Inang Wika.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the next decades, the balagtasan continued to be performed in schools, town fiestas, and in the celebration of the Buwan ng Wika (National Language Month), as well as on the radio. For example, on Oct 1987, the issue of whether the money received by the Philippines from the United States for using its territory for the latter&rsquo;s bases facilities was aid or rent was the main topic of the balagtasan written by Gregorio Victoria. This balagtasan, aired over DWRV <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4824\">Radio Veritas</a>, was part of the radio program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1457\"><strong>Kultura ng Bayan</strong></a></i></b>, sponsored by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, which featured a weekly balagtasan discussing relevant social issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The balagtasan is one of the preferred traditional theater forms used by sectoral groups and nongovernment institutions in clarifying social issues to the public. In 1991, for example, a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><b>bodabil</b></a>-like show titled <b><i>Nagalit ang Bulkan kay Uncle Sam</i></b> (The Volcano Got Mad at Uncle Sam) was staged at the Amoranto Multi-Purpose Hall sponsored by the National Council of Churches in the Philippines, Metro Manila Ecumenical Fellowship, Philippine Collegian, Bugkos, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5314\">Galian sa Arte at Tula</a>. The highlight of the show was a balagtasan debating on the advantages and disadvantages of retaining the US military bases in the Philippines. In 1995, after the death of Flor Contemplacion, the Filipino domestic helper sentenced to death in Singapore, a balagtasan was held in Manila to examine whether the government was remiss in its role of protecting overseas Filipino workers. Even the underground movement recognized the effectivity of the balagtasan. <b><i>Manahimik o Mag-aklas</i></b> (To Keep Silent or Protest) was written by Manuel Salva-Cruz and published in <b><i>Magsasaka: Ang Bayaning Di-Kilala</i></b> (The Farmer: The Unsung Hero), 1984, an anthology of poems, songs, stories, and illustrations of farmers and cultural activists. It was published by the Kilusan sa Paglilinang ng Rebolusyonaryong Panitikan at Sining sa Kanayunan. In this balagtasan, Juan Giting and Juan Kimi debated on what to do in times of extreme poverty: to keep silent or to protest?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 2009, the University of the Philippines Sentro ng Wikang Filipino, together with the Department of Education, sponsored a National Balagtasan Competition for high school students. The four teams that were carefully selected through various levels of competition from school level to the national level provided meaningful arguments to explain relevant topics, such as <b><i>Dapat Bang Magkaroon ng Uniporme sa Paaralan?</i></b> (Should Wearing School Uniforms Be Required?), <b><i>Dapat o Hindi Dapat Dagdagan ng Isa Pang Taon ang Hay-iskul</i></b> (Should There Be an Additional One Year in High School?), and <b><i>Sa Lumalalang Sitwasyong Pangkapayapaan sa Bansa, Sino ang Dapat Sisihin: Ang Tao o ang Pamahalaan?</i></b> (Who Is to Blame for the Worsening Peace Situation: The People or the Government?). The competition was held at the 2,100 seating capacity UP Theater, filled with an audience comprising mostly teachers and students who would at times get excited and interrupt the mambabalagtas in the middle of their argumentation. The project successfully recreated the spirit that made the balagtasan a very popular theater event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In 1988, a project was undertaken by the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information (COCI) to document and preserve various forms of cultural traditional media in ASEAN countries. In the Philippines, the cultural and traditional medium chosen was the balagtasan. The Philippine research group, headed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>, aimed to &ldquo;explore the possibilities of using a cultural and traditional form as a vehicle for development messages as well as measure its impact and effectiveness on the audience&rdquo; (ASEAN COCI 1991, 103). For five Saturdays in Oct and Nov 1989, and in Feb 1990, a group formed by the Cultural Center of the Philippines presented a balagtasan in six towns of Bulacan. Cresenciano C. Marquez Jr, who is also a mambabalagtas, was commissioned to write a balagtasan script on the topic <b><i>Ano ang Ugat ng Ating Kahirapan, Sistema ng Lipunan o Pananaw sa Buhay?</i></b> (What is the root cause of our poverty, the social system or our worldview?). Poet Alberto Suallo of Taytay, Rizal, argued that social structures and systems are the causes of poverty among Filipinos, as well as other related problems such as corruption, prostitution, insurgency, and drug addiction. On the other side, poet <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5048\">Teo T. Antonio</a> of Bulacan argued that worldview is mother to all these economic and social problems, and a change in the people&rsquo;s worldview and attitudes can alter structures and systems. Yolanda Rambuyon of Bi&ntilde;an, Laguna, acted as the Lakandiwa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A group of teachers and students from the UP College of Mass Communications, headed by Delia R. Barcelona, was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of the balagtasan in conveying developmental messages to the audience. Using a pretest/posttest approach of the survey method, the research was designed to measure the effects of the balagtasan on three aspects: cognitive, which refers to information learned by the audience about the topic; affective, which refers to the emotional response of the audience to the balagtasan as a medium; and behavioral, which refers to the course of action that the audience intends to take immediately after witnessing the balagtasan. In general, findings showed that the audience&rsquo;s awareness of issues related to poverty increased after exposure to the medium. The study proved that the balagtasan has a great potential as a medium for disseminating developmental messages (COCI 1991, 130).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Another interesting development of the balagtasan is its transformation into another form&mdash;the <b>flip top</b>. The term refers to the rap battle contest participated in by underground or amateur rappers. In this contest, two rappers are pitted against each other in a battle of a cappella rap. In freestyle rap, throwing an insult back at a challenger is called a &ldquo;flip.&rdquo; In most cases, each battle is composed of three rounds, and the winner is determined by a panel of judges. Similar to the traditional balagtasan, rappers are allowed to write the lyrics of their rap. One of the reasons behind the flip top&rsquo;s popularity is the use of Filipino in its lyrics, which is loosely structured and rhythmic and delivered in freestyle. Filipino vulgarities and cuss words are common elements of the lyrics, utilized to attack the opponent while debunking his arguments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The flip top battles gained prominence through the video-sharing site YouTube. The group called FlipTop, an events and artist handling company founded on 6 Feb 2010 by Alaric Riam Yuson, sponsors the Philippine Flip Top Battles and uploads videos of the battles on its official YouTube account &ldquo;fliptopbattles.&rdquo; Flip top has gained prominence not only in social media but also in the barangays and schools though interbarangay and intercollegiate competitions.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em style=\"\"><b>Written by&nbsp;</b></em><strong><i>Galileo S.

The balagtasan was born in a meeting on 28 Mar 1924 of the Kapulungang Balagtas, a society of writers and advocates of Tagalog, held at the Instituto de Mujeres, which was formerly located in Tayuman, Tondo, Manila. In the meeting, <a href=\"/9/80/5689\">Lope K. Santos</a> suggested the holding of a modern duplo to commemorate the birth anniversary of Balagtas. However, it was pointed out that staging a duplo would be inappropriate since it was more associated with death rituals. Patricio A. Dionisio suggested naming the presentation after Balagtas, but it was <a href=\"/9/9/5694\">Jose N. Sevilla</a> who coined the word &#x201C;balagtasan.&#x201D;"

There was a call for veteran and young poets alike to join the balagtasan event for the Balagtas celebration. There were three pairs of poets who responded and squared off against each other. Of the three, the pair of <a href=\"/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a> and <a href=\"/9/9/5178\">Florentino T. Collantes</a>, who debated on the topic <b><i>Bulaklak ng Lahing Kalinis-linisan</i></b> (Flower of the Race Most Pure), was the most popular since both were accomplished poets, and de Jesus was the president of <a href=\"/9/80/5389\">Ilaw at Panitik</a> while Collantes was the head of Bulalakaw."

Also in the panel of judges were Rosa Sevilla-Alvero as Lakan-Ilaw (Grand Light) and <a href=\"/9/9/5630\">I&#xF1;igo Ed. Regalado</a> as Gatpayo (Noble Adviser). The script of <b><i>Bulaklak ng Lahing Kalinis-linisan</i></b> was written by de Jesus and Collantes. They took turns in writing each side of the topic. This account proves that unlike its predecessor, the duplo, the balagtasan is scripted. Nevertheless, there is partial truth to the perception among audiences that it is extemporaneous. This happens when the topic has been tackled many times over by the same team of mambabalagtas such that the poets have already built an arsenal of arguments which they can readily draw from and use during the balagtasan even without much preparation."

The column Sariling Kuro of the newspaper <b><i>Ang Watawat</i></b> (The Flag) noted that the modification done on the duplo would greatly help in the development and propagation of the language of Balagtas. Such was the success of the De Jesus-Collantes tandem that the two poets debated again in public. After the first balagtasan, they argued on the topic <b><i>Magdaragat at Magbubukid </i></b>(Fisherman and Farmer). This balagtasan, in honor of <a href=\"/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>, was staged at the Opera House in Avenida Rizal. Collantes defended Magdaragat and De Jesus, Magbubukid. <a href=\"/9/80/5619\">Benigno Ramos</a> served as Lakandiwa. One account states that this battle resulted in a rift between De Jesus and Collantes. In some part of the balagtasan, when Collantes was delivering his stanzas, De Jesus recited some lines that were not in the original script: &#x201C;<i>Kung hindi lang sa nariritong marilag na diwata/disin sana ang mukha mo&#x2019;y inabot ng aking sipa</i>&#x201D; (If not for the presence of these beautiful muses/I would have kicked your face). This remark drew applause and laughter from the crowd, spurring Collantes to think of a rebuttal. He replied to Batute: &#x201C;<i>O, kataka-taka&#x2019;t kahima-himala/may kabayo palang marunong tumula</i>&#x201D; (Oh, what a great surprise/a horse who can recite a poem). This drew more cheers from the audience. But despite the reception, Jesus and Collantes entered into a silent feud that lasted for three months. It was reported that a number of balagtasan invitations were turned down because of this disagreement. Since they needed to engage with each other for succeeding duels, they decided to reconcile with the help of writer friends. This is further proof of an element of spontaneity in the performance of the balagtasan despite the presence of a script, an element which can be expected from a form that belongs to the oral tradition."

De Jesus defended the Filipina of Yesterday while Collantes, the Filipina of Today, with Manila Representative Francisco Varona as the Lakandiwa. It was staged at the Olympic Stadium on 18 Oct 1925. The audience included General Emilio Aguinaldo, senators, congressmen, and officials of Malaca&#xF1;an and universities. There were also delegations from Tayabas, Laguna, Cavite, Bataan, Rizal, and Bulacan among the audience. Newspaper reports estimated the crowd at 8,000 to 15,000. This balagtasan was adjudged by the audience, who voted for their favored poet by clapping. In this duel, De Jesus was honored as the first &#x201C;Hari ng Balagtasan&#x201D; (King of Balagtasan). The practice of bestowing the title &#x201C;Hari ng Balagtasan&#x201D; began with this encounter.

This happened in 1927 when political groups were debating on the issue of forming a single political party. In 1929, De Jesus regained the title in the <b><i>Ginto at Bakal</i></b> (Gold and Metal) balagtasan, in which he argued for Bakal against Collantes&#x2019; Ginto.

In freestyle rap, throwing an insult back at a challenger is called a &#x201C;flip.&#x201D; In most cases, each battle is composed of three rounds, and the winner is determined by a panel of judges. Similar to the traditional balagtasan, rappers are allowed to write the lyrics of their rap. One of the reasons behind the flip top&#x2019;s popularity is the use of Filipino in its lyrics, which is loosely structured and rhythmic and delivered in freestyle.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>balitaw/balitao</strong> is an extemporaneous poetic joust between a man and a woman that is accompanied by song and dance. It is a courtship play that also functions to strengthen social ties among peasant populations in the Visayas where it is performed during public celebrations, like harvest seasons and town fiestas. Before World War II, it was the most common form of entertainment in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>-speaking areas of the region, including Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental, and Leyte. Known as <strong>balitaw</strong> in Cebuano and Hiligaynon, and <strong>balak</strong>, <strong>amoral</strong>, and <strong>ismayling</strong> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray,</a> it is believed to have already existed prior to the arrival of the Spaniards in the country. With the mass migration of Visayans to Mindanao in the postwar years, the form has also reached the southern island region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the earliest accounts on the balitaw is that of Jesuit missionary Francisco Ignacio Alcina in his <strong><em>Historia de las Islas e Indios de <strong><strong>Bisaya</strong></strong>s</em></strong> (History of the Islands and Natives of Visayas), 1668. He describes the balak (balitaw to the Cebuano and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>) as a rhymed metaphorical joust between a man and a woman whose subject is commonly &ldquo;the affairs of love&rdquo; (Alcina 1668, 3:45). The exchanges, which are performed during drinking sessions or at work, are either verbal or musical, with the former depending largely on wit and speed. In cases when music is employed, the woman plays a&nbsp;<em>kurlung&nbsp;</em>while the man a&nbsp;<em>kuriapi</em>. The Cebuano balitaw, meanwhile, was originally sung to the accompaniment of a&nbsp;<em>subing</em>, a kind of bamboo flute, or a guitar made of a coconut shell. During the Spanish period, the harp, which had more chords, replaced the indigenous musical instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was also during the Spanish occupation that Christian values, such as self-sacrifice, respect for elders, and roles of women, were infused into the themes of the balitaw. Performances extended to Christian holidays like Christmas and feast days. The Waray balak adopted a Hispanized name, amoral, which may be a blend of the Spanish words for love and morals. The new name also hints on the didactic tendency of the form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Americanization, which introduced more modern forms of entertainment like the motion picture and the phonograph, contributed to the alienation of the people from the form, with the balitaw getting relegated to the countryside. In response to the changes, the balitaw developed a more embellished melody that clearly drew influence from American <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779#the%20american%20era%20(1898-1945)\">jazz</a>. This was called <strong>tirana</strong>. In Waray-speaking areas, the amoral came to be known as ismayling<em>,</em>an allusion to the smiles that the performances drew from the people who were recovering from the United States-triggered retaliatory massacres that rocked Samar. The balitaw also evolved to become a written form, which was intended to be sung. This was called <strong>balitaw romansada</strong>. Written balitaw graced the pages of local Cebuano newspapers from 1901 to the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5142\">Fernando Buyser</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mga <strong>Awit</strong> sa Kabukiran</em></strong> (Songs of the Countryside) contains some of the earliest Cebuano balitaw still extant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Japanese occupation somehow did the balitaw good for city dwellers who fled to the hills to escape Japanese tyranny and were reunited with the form. Here, during fiesta celebrations and harvests, they witnessed once more the performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the postwar years, the <strong>drama-balitaw</strong> emerged, which was performed on a formal stage with drop curtains and props. Unlike the classic balitaw, it had a plot, not just a theme. It also included more characters, with the man and the woman debaters still playing lead. Radio programs also picked up on the balitaw through sponsorships from private firms, like the Philippine Manufacturing Company and San Miguel Brewery. A balitaw program was aired over DYRC from 1948 to 1950 and from 1954 to 1955. <strong><em><strong><strong>Rosas</strong></strong> Pangdan</em></strong> was a balitaw produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3022\">Pio Kabahar</a> for film. Its theme song by the same title has become a classic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proof of the balitaw&rsquo;s tenacity in contemporary times is its presence in unusual settings. In a corner of some cockpits in the Visayas and Mindanao, a group of men usually gather for a betting game called <strong>dejado</strong>. At the center is a <strong>dejadista</strong>, a female singer who challenges men to a balitaw. The dejadista sometimes goes unchallenged, prompting her to sing alone. The Queen of the Cebuano balitaw, Nicolasa Ca&ntilde;iban, more popularly known as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4017\">Colasing</a>, left Cebu for Mindanao when the balitaw&rsquo;s popularity waned in the Visayas after the war. Here she made a living out of selling fish in the public market where she continued to sing the balitaw to attract customers. The Waray ismayling, on the other hand, has been used for revolutionary purposes in remote areas in the Eastern Visayas. Instead of the male courting the female, one finds the former recruiting the latter to the communist movement, thus subordinating the love element in the traditional form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love is the most common theme of many Cebuano balitaw. In the 1920s and 1930s when the balitaw was at its heyday, performances, which were usually held around a field clearing, began with a salutation and self-introduction by one or both contestants (Kapili 1951, 46-47). The man then proceeded to state his case with the aim of winning the woman&rsquo;s affection. The woman repeatedly declined the man&rsquo;s advances and the performance would last several hours until one of them was outwitted. The balitaw of Luis and Pinay, which is the most widely published Cebuano balitaw to date, shows the comic tussle that ensues immediately after the man&rsquo;s salutation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luis: Kining akong paghigugma</p>\r\n\r\n<p>sa bukog, Inday, mikagit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kung hinog ka pa lang sab-a</p>\r\n\r\n<p>lamyon ko hangtod ang panit<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinay: Dili ako, Luis, mutu-o</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nianang imong mga sulti</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pila na kaha ka babaye</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ang imo nianang gitunto?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Luis: This love of mine, Inday</p>\r\n\r\n<p>is in my very bones</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Were you a ripe banana</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;d swallow you unpeeled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pinay: I don&rsquo;t believe you, Luis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&rsquo;t buy your words</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I wonder how many women</p>\r\n\r\n<p>have been fooled by your sweet talk?)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the Ilonggo, the balitaw is performed during the different stages of courtship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documented balitaw performances since the American period have been observed to follow a 3/4 time signature, like many Cebuano folk songs. The major key is set at C for happy and quirky verses while the minor key is at A for sentimental ones. The balitaw&rsquo;s melody is generally monotonous but may change to adjust to the performers&rsquo; versification. This improvisation is called an <strong>ad lib</strong>. The interlude in the melody is essential to the performers for it buys them time to think of their next verses. The dance steps are generally made simple so they do not interfere with the singing and the versification. Balitaw performances are generally more sung than danced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audience&rsquo;s preference for variety has prompted the balitaw to continuously transform. During the American occupation, the monotonous antiphonal balitaw had to compete with the polyphonic tunes of American music. This led to the replacement of the diatonic Spanish harp, which used to accompany the performances, with the more versatile Visayan five-string <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>. With a musical accompaniment capable of playing more tunes, the balitaw&rsquo;s tune began to veer away from the traditional antiphonal type toward that of Western music. Such was the case of the tirana, a balitaw that draws influence from American jazz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experiments in form were also explored. Possibilities of a written balitaw were realized in the balitaw romansada, which sprung from the need of having to diversify the cast of the balitaw (Gutierrez 1961, 29). In the romansada, a third character who could not participate in the joust was given his/her own monologue which he or she sings. The romansada would foreshadow the creation of the drama-balitaw which had characters other than the male and female leads. In the drama-balitaw, the narrative was as imperative as the debate. The narrative element of the drama-balitaw was retained when the balitaw was adapted for radio and film in the postwar years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The element of exchange or jousting seems to have gradually disappeared from the balitaw in the contemporary period. A dejadista, a female singer who sings the balitaw in a corner of a cockpit, may find herself singing the balitaw alone when no man takes on her challenge.

				"value": "One of the earliest accounts on the balitaw is that of Jesuit missionary Francisco Ignacio Alcina in his <strong><em>Historia de las Islas e Indios de <strong><strong>Bisaya</strong></strong>s</em></strong> (History of the Islands and Natives of Visayas), 1668. He describes the balak (balitaw to the Cebuano and <a href=\"/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>) as a rhymed metaphorical joust between a man and a woman whose subject is commonly &#x201C;the affairs of love&#x201D; (Alcina 1668, 3:45). The exchanges, which are performed during drinking sessions or at work, are either verbal or musical, with the former depending largely on wit and speed. In cases when music is employed, the woman plays a&#xA0;<em>kurlung&#xA0;</em>while the man a&#xA0;<em>kuriapi</em>. The Cebuano balitaw, meanwhile, was originally sung to the accompaniment of a&#xA0;<em>subing</em>, a kind of bamboo flute, or a guitar made of a coconut shell. During the Spanish period, the harp, which had more chords, replaced the indigenous musical instruments."

Performances extended to Christian holidays like Christmas and feast days. The Waray balak adopted a Hispanized name, amoral, which may be a blend of the Spanish words for love and morals. The new name also hints on the didactic tendency of the form."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Americanization, which introduced more modern forms of entertainment like the motion picture and the phonograph, contributed to the alienation of the people from the form, with the balitaw getting relegated to the countryside. In response to the changes, the balitaw developed a more embellished melody that clearly drew influence from American <a href=\"/5/35/779#the%20american%20era%20(1898-1945)\">jazz</a>. This was called <strong>tirana</strong>. In Waray-speaking areas, the amoral came to be known as ismayling<em>,</em>an allusion to the smiles that the performances drew from the people who were recovering from the United States-triggered retaliatory massacres that rocked Samar. The balitaw also evolved to become a written form, which was intended to be sung. This was called <strong>balitaw romansada</strong>. Written balitaw graced the pages of local Cebuano newspapers from 1901 to the outbreak of the Pacific War in 1941. <a href=\"/9/80/5142\">Fernando Buyser</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Mga <strong>Awit</strong> sa Kabukiran</em></strong> (Songs of the Countryside) contains some of the earliest Cebuano balitaw still extant."

				"value": "In the postwar years, the <strong>drama-balitaw</strong> emerged, which was performed on a formal stage with drop curtains and props. Unlike the classic balitaw, it had a plot, not just a theme. It also included more characters, with the man and the woman debaters still playing lead. Radio programs also picked up on the balitaw through sponsorships from private firms, like the Philippine Manufacturing Company and San Miguel Brewery. A balitaw program was aired over DYRC from 1948 to 1950 and from 1954 to 1955. <strong><em><strong><strong>Rosas</strong></strong> Pangdan</em></strong> was a balitaw produced by <a href=\"/7/60/3022\">Pio Kabahar</a> for film. Its theme song by the same title has become a classic."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Proof of the balitaw&#x2019;s tenacity in contemporary times is its presence in unusual settings. In a corner of some cockpits in the Visayas and Mindanao, a group of men usually gather for a betting game called <strong>dejado</strong>. At the center is a <strong>dejadista</strong>, a female singer who challenges men to a balitaw. The dejadista sometimes goes unchallenged, prompting her to sing alone. The Queen of the Cebuano balitaw, Nicolasa Ca&#xF1;iban, more popularly known as <a href=\"/5/5/4017\">Colasing</a>, left Cebu for Mindanao when the balitaw&#x2019;s popularity waned in the Visayas after the war.

		"text": "<p>The term bodabil, also known as vodavil, vaudeville,or the stage show, refers to a stage presentation consisting of a variety of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musical</a> and comedy acts, skits and monologues, novelty and acrobatic numbers, solos and chorus lines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Derived from French vaudeville and adapted into American theater, it entered the country during the American colonial era, although a Spanish predecessor might have been the can-can danced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2936\">Praxedes (Yeyeng) Fernandez</a> in the <strong>zarzuelita comico-bufa</strong> titled <em><strong>Pascual Bailon</strong></em>, 1886, which triggered much positive and negative reaction, as well as a pastoral letter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 1901, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a> advertised a &ldquo;Novelty in Manila&rdquo; that promised &ldquo;Good American Orchestra, New Acts, New Songs, Good Jokes, Acrobats, Dancers, Contortionists, The Most Brilliant and Stupendous Minstrel First Part Extant, Beautiful Lights and Scenic Effects, Gorgeous Costuming, Ragtime Talks, Ragtime Songs, Ragtime Walks, Every Feature Bright and Up to Date, Plus&mdash;A Grand Walk of All Nations!&rdquo; These were at first performed by visiting troupes, such as the one that presented in 1906 the singer-dancer &ldquo;Little Egypt&rdquo; (&ldquo;a sensation in Europe and the US&rdquo;); the contortionist Eva Rowland; Beattie Gallardi, billed as queen of the comic opera; the &ldquo;celebrated baritone&rdquo; Willie Green; the &ldquo;comedianteimprovisado&rdquo; Bobby Mack; and the singing and dancing Rosebud Sisters.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">\r\n<p>Bodabil became indigenized in the second decade, when Filipino performers learned to perform in the American mode. A <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> called Luis Borromeo returned from America and Canada in 1921 as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3911\">Borromeo Lou</a>, and introduced Filipinos to what he called &ldquo;Classic-<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">Jazz</a> Music.&rdquo; It was he who renamed the form &ldquo;vod-a-vil,&rdquo; which Filipinos later adapted into &ldquo;bodabil.&rdquo; He organized a bodabil company, with such presentations as Foolish Wives, Noche de Jazz, and Tokiohokoyoko, and such performers (now part of bodabil history) as Natalia, a dancer; Hanasan and Toytoy (Diana Toy), singers; Maestro Back who played jazz on the xylophone; and the Alabama brothers. Jazz and the blues soon became part of Manila&rsquo;s musical idiom, edging out the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">sarsuwela</a> songs that had been the hits of the era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBodabil insinuated itself into local theater first as intermission numbers (sometimes called &ldquo;jamboree,&rdquo; as was the full-cast musical opening number) between major circus numbers or the acts of full-length sarsuwela, or between the three one-act plays that made up an evening&rsquo;s bill. Then, when short film features called cinematografocame to town, it was also found there: songs and dances between screenings, while the film was being rewound. Soon, however, since these discrete numbers were easier to assemble into a show than were all the elements of a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> or sarsuwela, bodabil became its own attraction .</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The numbers, of course, and the style of performance all came from their American models. Not only jazz and blues were introduced but also American <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/769\">ballads</a> (&ldquo;Ramona,&rdquo; &ldquo;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&rdquo;) and the Latin beat (&ldquo;Carioca,&rdquo; &ldquo;Besame Mucho&rdquo;); chorus girls (their legs and short skirts eye-popping in a culture of long tresses and long skirts) and contortionists; acrobats and stand-up comics, animal tricks to rival the circuses in town, tap dancing and the jitterbug. Philippine songs, especially the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\"><em>kundiman</em></a> (love songs), were offered, a small dish in an American smorgasbord.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The shows were at first staged in a boxing arena called the Olympic Stadium, but soon drifted to cinema houses, where they alternated with screenings, and coexisted with their greatest rival, the movie. By 1923, Manila had three theaters primarily devoted to bodabil: the Savoy (later renamed Clover), the Sirena, and the Rivoli; by 1941 there were 40 Manila theaters showing both bodabil and motion pictures. Eventually, in a career that unwound into the 1960s, the Clover Theater and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a> came to be known as the homes of bodabil. Impresarios&mdash;like Jose Zarah, a Portuguese dancer; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4666\">Lou Salvador Sr</a>, called the &ldquo;Master Showman&rdquo;; Enrique Davila; and Lazarus Joseph&mdash;devoted their time and attention to the new entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the war years, the Japanese authorities considered the Filipinos too Western in orientation, so American movies were banned. The entertainment gap was filled by bodabil, which came to be called the stage show. This differed from prewar shows in that, although it still had the comics, the dancers, the musicians, and the kundiman singers, it also had full-length plays that employed the actors of stage and screen who had been rendered idle by the war. Often the plays were about Philippine heroes, walks of life, and people, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a>&rsquo;s <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/687\"><strong>Wanted: A Chaperon</strong></a></em>, 1940, and <em><strong>Forever</strong></em>, 1941; sometimes they were translations of plays like Lillian Hellman&rsquo;s <em><strong>The Little Foxes</strong></em>, Noel Coward&rsquo;s <strong><em>Private Lives</em></strong>, W. Jacobs&rsquo;s <em><strong>The</strong></em> <em><strong>Monkey&rsquo;s Paw</strong></em>, and Edmond Rostand&rsquo;s <em><strong>Cyrano de Bergerac</strong></em>. The stage shows were mobbed in the war years. The gate of the Avenue Theater once crashed down in the rush of patrons awaiting curtain time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stage shows were especially popular because they bore hidden messages of encouragement for the war-weary people. The comedians <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a>, for example, made fun of their conquerors (and were jailed for it); skits were staged about the return of &ldquo;Mang Arturo&rdquo; (MacArthur). Guerrillas were said to be in the audience, needing encouragement too, with a special song sung onstage to signal to them that the Kempeitai were around. The Japanese censors&rsquo; restrictions actually caused a rebirth of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog </a>theater, right in the theaters where Hollywood had reigned supreme.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, when American films returned, bodabil countered with burlesque, colloquially called <strong>haba-haba</strong>, and in the 1950s had a brief flowering, with long lines of men waiting to get into such theaters as the Manila Grand Opera House and the Alegria. This started, however, a long downward slide, until in the 1970s the vestiges of bodabil were to be found only in sleazy theaters (where rose the <em>bomba</em> or sex film), where only the variety of acts remained to remind one of the old bodabil. The rest were cheap musicians and magicians, and even cheaper performers&mdash;not so much singing or dancing, as parading around in flimsy garments, in what were euphemistically called &ldquo;fashion shows.&rdquo; In the 1970s and 1980s, bodabil&rsquo;s lowest point was visible in such places as the Gala and Cubao Cinemas, and the theaters of Olongapo, near the American base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In its flowering and reign, however, bodabil made considerable impact on Filipino popular culture and consciousness. Aside from being entertainment that is still reflected in the variety shows on television and in the entertainment acts at political rallies, it was actually unnoticed, insidious, thorough, and pleasurable Americanization. The greats of Philippine bodabil were popularizers of American culture: the legendary <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2880\">Katy de la Cruz</a>, magnificent torch singer a la Sophie Tucker; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2813\">Canuplin</a>, the &ldquo;Charlie Chaplin of the Philippines&rdquo;; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2423\">Bayani Casimiro</a> who was the Stan Laurel to Jose Criso&nbsp;Soto&rsquo;s Oliver Hardy, but later glided onto the stage as the &ldquo;Philippine Fred Astaire,&rdquo; a title also claimed by dancer Benny Mack; all the boogie dancers and jazz/pop singers who made the American lifestyle seem so near and so desirable; and later all the talented singers who called themselves Philippine Elvis Presleys, Frank Sinatras, Perry Comos, and Joni Jameses&mdash;in the belief that they could not &ldquo;make it&rdquo; unless they were copies of an American original.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the rhythm and color of bodabil, the audience learned to see themselves in American images; the Filipino performer learned to belt and croon, to swing and sway, and, with the audience, to dream the American Dream. Today, although the stages are filled with original Philippine music, dance, drama, and performers, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\">Diomedes Maturan</a>, &ldquo;Philippine Perry Como&rdquo; of the 1950s, still sings &ldquo;The Rose Tattoo&rdquo; and eager young singers audition for Miss Saigon&mdash;and often make it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of its popularity, bodabil itself has been used for propaganda. During the first years of Marcos&rsquo;s martial law, the slogan &ldquo;Sa ikauunlad ng bayan, disiplinaangkailangan&rdquo; (For the country to progress, discipline is necessary) was repeatedly announced over the microphone at the &ldquo;newly revived&rdquo; and sanitized bodabil at the Manila Grand Opera House. For some months these shows featured plays that denounced drug pushers and &ldquo;rebels&rdquo; among others. Later, bodabil was again used as a form of political theater, this time against the dictatorship. In 1980-86, UP Tropang Bodabil (later <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3166\">Peryante</a>), used vaudeville characters (barkers, clowns, comedy partners, sexy dancing girls), forms (dumb acts as opening numbers, magic acts, dog shows, horror shows, acrobatics, and musical dance extravaganzas to end the show), and production design (telon de boca, huge colorful props, skimpy and glittering costumes).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays such as <em><strong>Bodabil</strong></em> (Vaudeville), 1980, <em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/562\">Ilokula: Ang Ilokanong Drakula</a> I </strong></em>and <em><strong>II</strong></em> (Ilocula: The Ilocano Dracula), 1980 and 1983 respectively, and <strong><em>Bomba</em>&nbsp;</strong>(Bomb), 1984, used political satire to discuss issues like imperialism, the Marcos dynasty, and the Bataan nuclear power plant. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Associatio</a>n&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/527\"><em><strong>Canuplin: Isang Improbisasyon sa Buhay at Mga Palabas ng Isang&nbsp;Komedyanteng Pilipino</strong></em></a> (Canuplin: An Improvisation on the Life and Shows of a Filipino Comedian), dramatized the pathetic life of local bodabil&rsquo;s Charlie Chaplin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2012, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>, who had done extensive research and interviews with stage show performers during the postwar years wrote the play <em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/670\"><strong>Stageshow</strong></a></em>, the third <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> production in its 26th season.

		"text": "<p><strong>Brechtian theater</strong>, also known as <strong>epic theater</strong> or <strong>theater of instruction</strong>, refers to one type of modern Philippine theater influenced and inspired by Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956). This is principally characterized by a social and pedagogical orientation and a presentational style that can employ mime, songs, dances, slides, stylized sets and costumes, and typical characters and stories taken from folklore, history, and other nonrealistic sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting in Germany in the 1920s, it became popular in the United States after 1945. Brecht&rsquo;s epic theater seeks to explain and dissect issues and ideas before the audience. In this theater, each scene is presented for its own theme or variation on the main theme, resulting in a cyclical, rather than linear, play structure.

Discussions underscore Brecht&rsquo;s efforts to transform theater into pleasurable instruction for the marginalized people of his time. The chosen play is studied closely, with the basic contradiction in it pointed out in relation to the social forces in Brecht&rsquo;s time and society as well as in contemporary Philippine society. Understanding Brecht is completed when actual rehearsals and discussions begin, and wrong notions about Brecht&rsquo;s theater are corrected. In this way, the Brechtian verfremdungseffekt becomes not only a reorientation, much less a theatrical technique, but also a revival of collective political energy and a redirection of the citizens&rsquo; will toward a real power of the people. During the Marcos regime, the philosophy and techniques of Brecht&rsquo;s epic theater greatly influenced the creation of a people&rsquo;s theater.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Maria Luisa T.

		"text": "<p><strong>Carillo</strong>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>carrillo&nbsp;</em>or &ldquo;small cart,&rdquo; referred both to the little open-air theaters of bamboo and to the shadow plays shown in them in the late 19th century. The form was also known as <strong>potei</strong>, <strong>kikimut</strong>, and <strong>titire</strong> in Pampanga.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On a stage with crudely painted scenery were presented cardboard figures held up by means of wooden sticks before a lighted lamp, and projected against a white sheet. Through pantomimic movement and dialogue provided by the manipulators, they presented stories from the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido</em>, or <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a> about lives of saints or the adventures of chivalric figures&mdash;the same material used in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a><em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calle Magdalena at San Jose de Trozo (in what is now the Santa Cruz district) was the site of a popular carillo theater run by one Navarro (Navarrito) de Peralta, whose repertoire is said to have included <strong><em>Don Juan Tenorio</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ibong&nbsp;<strong>Adarna</strong></em></strong> (Adarna Bird), <strong><em>Siete Infantes da Lara</em></strong> (Seven Sons of Lara), <strong><em>La Tia Norica</em></strong> (The Aunt Norica), and <strong><em>Los Sudores del Rey Momo</em></strong> (The Toils of King Momo), shown to audiences composed mainly of the young. Fees charged at the gate ranged from two to four&nbsp;<em>quartos&nbsp;</em>for those without seats (who sat on their haunches before the low stage), half a <em>real&nbsp;</em>for benches, and one real for chairs. Some carillo were offered for free, like those of Vicente Letran, who put on a <strong>carrillo de sombras</strong> (little cart of shadows) from the window of his house; of Natalio Pascual, whose free show ran in Dilao (now Paco) for three weeks from 8:00 to 11:00 every evening; and of Gabriel Mercado, a laborer, whose carillo was run by young boys in training. These were approved by the authorities on condition that an officer of the&nbsp;<em>guardia civil&nbsp;</em>(constabulary) would make regular inspections. The Pampanga potei or kikimut, which supposedly used wooden puppets, were presented by &ldquo;Chinese workers&rdquo; in vacant lots in the evenings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>There has been no further evidence of the carillo after the Spanish period. However, some present-day theater groups have used a version of it for some of their productions, such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/541\"><strong>Dupluhang Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Poetic Joust) and plays by the Susi ng Tayabas of Quezon province. Contemporary shadow and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/466\">puppetry</a> plays may also be considered to have been influenced by the carillo. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat</a>, based in the University of the Philippines Diliman&rsquo;s College of Arts and Letters, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2741\">Anino Shadowplay Collective</a>, based in the Philippine High School for the Arts, are examples. Elements of shadow play have been used in plays like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/682\"><strong><em>Umaaraw, Umuulan, Kinakasalang&nbsp;<strong>Tikbalang</strong></em></strong></a> (Sun Shining, Rain Pouring, Horse Demons Wed), 2011, and <strong><em>Bilanggo ng Pag-ibig</em></strong> (Prisoner of Love), 2014, both by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2925\">Jose Estrella</a> for <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, El Gamma Penumbra, the shadow play group from Tanauan, Batangas, won the first season of <strong><em>Asia&rsquo;s Got Talent</em></strong>. The group&rsquo;s productions are noted for their imaginative and effective use of shadows, using only their bodies and a minimum of props to create images of humans, flora, and fauna smoothly morphing into each other. Before winning <strong><em>Asia&rsquo;s Got Talent</em></strong>, the group placed fourth in the Philippine version of the franchise. It was chosen to be part of the Philippine tourism campaign &ldquo;Choose Philippines&rdquo; and was frequently invited to do television, community, and corporate shows. The group&rsquo;s repertoire highlighted the creative use of shadow play not just for entertainment but in communicating timely developmental messages to a wide variety of audiences.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

Fees charged at the gate ranged from two to four&#xA0;<em>quartos&#xA0;</em>for those without seats (who sat on their haunches before the low stage), half a <em>real&#xA0;</em>for benches, and one real for chairs. Some carillo were offered for free, like those of Vicente Letran, who put on a <strong>carrillo de sombras</strong> (little cart of shadows) from the window of his house; of Natalio Pascual, whose free show ran in Dilao (now Paco) for three weeks from 8:00 to 11:00 every evening; and of Gabriel Mercado, a laborer, whose carillo was run by young boys in training. These were approved by the authorities on condition that an officer of the&#xA0;<em>guardia civil&#xA0;</em>(constabulary) would make regular inspections. The Pampanga potei or kikimut, which supposedly used wooden puppets, were presented by &#x201C;Chinese workers&#x201D; in vacant lots in the evenings."

		"text": "<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s theater</strong> may refer to plays with children as actors, or plays performed by adults for children. The aims of children&rsquo;s theater in the Philippines go beyond self-expression, toward the encouragement of creativity and self-esteem among children, and beyond entertainment, toward value formation and cultural formation through an appreciation of Philippine history, culture, and artistry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>School-Based Children&rsquo;s Theater.</strong> Theater with children as actors is often school based. In the case of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2753\">Ateneo Children&rsquo;s Theater (ACT)</a>, which has been producing an annual play since 1931, a large number of grade school boys and girls from neighboring schools, like Maryknoll (later Miriam) and St. Bridget School, learn about theater, values and people, and history and society while developing their artistic talents. For decades the plays of ACT were directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3262\">Mariano Singson</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ateneo Children&rsquo;s Theater has regularly mounted children&rsquo;s plays, both foreign and Filipino, from various sources, using different forms of theater. These include <strong><em>Lualhati</em></strong> (Glory), 1983; <strong><em>Tolda</em></strong> (Canvas Awning), 1984; <strong><em>Ignatius of Loyola</em></strong>, 1991, <strong><em>Joseph and His Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</em></strong>, 1993; <strong><em>Aladdin</em></strong>, 1994; <strong><em>Mga Prinsipe ng Dagat</em></strong> (The Princes of the Sea), 1995; <strong><em>Batubayani</em></strong> (Stone Hero), 1996; <strong><em>Gregorio del Pilar: Ang Batang Heneral</em></strong> (Gregorio del Pilar: The Young General), 1997; <strong><em>Mga Bata ng Himagsikan</em></strong> (Children of War), 1998; <strong><em>Sa Ngalan ng Ama</em></strong> (In the Name of the Father), 2000; <strong><em>Agyu</em></strong>, 2001; <strong><em>The Wiz</em></strong>, 2002; <strong><em>Fiddler on the Roof</em></strong>, 2003; <strong><em>Big: The <strong>Musical</strong></em></strong>, 2004; <strong><em>The King and I</em></strong>, 2005; <strong><em>Seussical: The Musical</em></strong>, 2006; <strong><em>Beauty and the Beast</em></strong>, 2007; <strong><em>High School Musical</em></strong>, 2008; <strong><em><strong>Adarna</strong> at ang Alaala ng Kristal</em></strong> (Adarna and the Memory of Crystal), 2009; <strong><em><strong>Batang Rizal</strong></em></strong> (Young Rizal), 2010; <strong><em>Ang Nawalang Kapatid</em></strong> (The Missing Sibling), 2011; <strong><em>Astig</em></strong> (Cool), 2012; <strong><em>Kules</em></strong>, 2013; <strong><em>Alex in Wonderland</em></strong>, 2014; and <strong><em>Mga Kuwentong Hari</em></strong> (King&rsquo;s Stories), 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also school-based is the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a> in the University of the Philippines (UP), where its founder, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>, was an English literature professor. Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio uses Asian theater influences in her creation of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/466\">puppets</a> and of plays for children, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/500\"><strong><em>Abadeja: Ang Ating Sinderela</em></strong></a> (Abadeja: Our Own Cinderella), 1977, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/641\"><strong><em>Papet <strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (The Passion of Jesus Christ in Puppetry), 1986. The puppeteers are young people, usually university students; the audience, children from schools or communities gathered at the Teatrong Mulat Theater in Teacher&rsquo;s Village, Quezon City, or at various auditoriums in and out of the university, or at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The St. Scholastica&rsquo;s College Manila&rsquo;s Children and Teachers Theater group was launched in 1990 by its artistic director, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2855\">Naty Crame-Rogers</a>, through the initiative of grade school principal Florina Feliciano-Castillo. Building on the concept of &ldquo;drama in education,&rdquo; or DIE, which began in the United States and Europe in the 1960s, theater has been integrated into the curriculum as a method of teaching, specifically in the language, social studies, and humanities courses in Grades IV, V, VI, and VII. As part of the curriculum, all students are required to attend and participate in their particular level&rsquo;s annual production, for which classroom discussions and homeroom assignments are given and graded at the start and end of the production. During their particular production months, formal classroom procedures are stopped (except in the math and science subjects) to give both the students and teachers time to work on the play. In 1992, with a view to developing knowledge and understanding of the classics, as well as Southeast Asian heritage and Benedictine values, the Grade IV presentation was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/575\"><strong><em>Junto al Pasig</em></strong></a> (Beside the Pasig), presented at the CCP and featuring professional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3349\">Lou Veloso</a> in the role of Satan; the Grade V presentation was Antonio Bayon&rsquo;s <strong><em>Radia Malakas</em></strong> (Rajah Malakas); Grade VI presented Shakespeare&rsquo;s <strong><em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong>;and Grade VII presented the <strong><em>Benedictine Pageant</em></strong>,a pageant about Saints Benedict and Scholastica.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sining Pangkabataan was founded by its director <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2774\">Antee Bass-Hernandez</a> in Dec 1988 and is based at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2899\">UP Department of Speech and Theater Arts</a>. An offshoot of the 1988 CCP Summer Children&rsquo;s Theater Workshop, the group produced original Filipino <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musicals</a>: <strong><em>Tagisan</em></strong> (Struggle), 1988, with libretto by Lerric Santos and choreography by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2545\">Douglas Nierras</a>; <strong><em><strong>Tikbalang</strong></em></strong>, 1989, written and staged by college students from UP; <strong><em>Munting Mithi</em></strong> (Little Dream), 1990, the group&rsquo;s first co-production with the UP Integrated School (UPIS), involving 450 children from the UPIS Kindergarten to Grade II; <strong><em><strong>Mama</strong>halin Kita: Kali-K-san</em></strong> (I Will Love You, Nature), 1991, a kabuki-inspired play conceptualized by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2774\">Bass-Hernandez</a>; and <strong><em>Pagdiriwang</em></strong> (Celebration), 1992, written by a pool of writers headed by Rhea Preclaro. Initially an adult group performing for children, it now helps child performers take the stage for their peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Philippine High School for the Arts&rsquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2741\">An-i-no: Shadow Puppet Collective</a>, composed of graduates and students, was formed in 1993. The group premiered at the CCP in Feb 1993 with a highly improvisational multimedia puppetry production titled <strong><em>The Shadow Play</em></strong>,an interpretation of 13 different popular songs, including <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4224\">Yoyoy Villame</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Buchikik&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\">Magellan</a>,&rdquo; and original compositions by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3884\">Joey Ayala</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3850\">Edru Abraham</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4033\">Kontra-Gapi</a>. The group experimented with both nontraditional and traditional theater gadgets and methods, such as shadow play with the puppeteers&rsquo; own hands and bodies; images created by &ldquo;playing&rdquo; with a slide projector and objects such as sand; and the puppeteers &ldquo;acting&rdquo; with the shadows and puppets. The CCP has toured An-i-no&rsquo;s shows in different provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>, though not school based, is consistent in its efforts at children&rsquo;s theater,evolving a Children&rsquo;s Program that might be considered parallel to or even more comprehensive than the actual school-based children&rsquo;s theater groups. The Children&rsquo;s Program develops theater artistry in children, as well as adult artists and educators, for childrens&rsquo; theater inside and outside of PETA. It offers workshops for children that include creative activities in the visual arts (drawing,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/15/2104\"><em>komiks</em></a>, puppets, masks), in movement and dance, in writing (poems and stories), in music and sound, and in drama and improvisation. Modules developed for the program include Kasaysayan ng Pilipinas (History of the Philippines), Papet at Maskara (Puppet and Mask), Dulang Panradyo (Radio Play), Midya (Media), Awit (Song), Galaw at Sayaw (Movement and Dance), Katatakutan at Pantasya (Horror and Fantasy), Prehistory on Outer Space, Alamat (Legend), Katutubong Kuwento (Ethnic Tales), and Katutubong Laro (Ethnic Games). The other side of the program involves training schoolteachers, parents, and other adults to become trainers for children&rsquo;s theater, after hearing lectures on the artistic experience of children, the philosophy of child care and development, and the principles and methods of educating children&rsquo;s theater groups.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PETA used puppetry in its earlier productions for children, such as <strong><em>Ang Babae sa Bote</em></strong> (The Lady in the Bottle), <strong><em>Hayop Man ay Lumuluha Rin</em></strong> (Even Animals Cry), and <strong><em>Sa Tabi ng Pasig</em></strong> (Beside Pasig), all presented in 1973; and <strong><em><strong>Salam</strong>angkero</em></strong> (Magician), 1974. Other children&rsquo;s plays that used various theater forms are Ritchie Valencia&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sampung Mga Daliri</em></strong> (Ten Little Fingers), 1978; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene Villanueva</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Samperang Muta</em></strong> (One Centavo Mote), 1982; Dario Fo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Kuwento ng Tigre</em></strong> (The Tiger&rsquo;s Tale), 1982; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3651\">Nonoy Marcelo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2844\">Ernie Cloma</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>NGO: Ang Dagang Patay</em></strong> (NGO: The Dead Rat), 1988; Cloma&rsquo;s <strong><em>Si Bodyok at si Ningning</em></strong> (Bodyok and Ningning), 1990; Angelo Dazo&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Alamat ni Limbaswang: Ang Batang Ampon ng mga Aswang</em></strong> (The Legend of Limbaswang: The Adopted Child of the Malignant Beings), 1992; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2783\">Christine Bellen</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/612\"><strong><em><strong>Mga Kuwento ni <strong>Lola</strong> Basyang</strong></em></strong></a> (Stories of Grandma Basyang), 2005, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/515\"><strong><em>Batang Rizal</em></strong></a> (Young Rizal), 2007; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ismail at Isabel</em></strong> (Ismail and Isabel), 2009, <strong><em>Ang Post Office</em></strong> (The Post Office), 2010; and <strong><em>Tandang Sora: Ang Lola <strong>Nating</strong> <strong>Bayani</strong></em></strong> (Tandang Sora: Our Grandmother Hero), 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Community-Based Children&rsquo;s Theater Groups.</strong> Another type of theater for children by children is that which is community-based. One of the three performing ensembles of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2751\">Arts Research and Training Institute in Southern Tagalog, Incorporated (ARTIST Inc)</a>, a theater group established in 1987, is Children&rsquo;s Literature, Arts, and Performances (CLAP), which focuses on children&rsquo;s productions. CLAP has mounted musical performances, which include <strong><em>Maryang <strong><strong>Kala</strong></strong>basa</em></strong> (Mary the Squash), 1995; <strong><em>Sina Marya at Si Kiling</em></strong> (Mary and Kiling), 2002; and <strong><em>Ibarang</em></strong>, 2007. The ensemble has also released two CD albums, <strong><em>Sina Marya at Si Kiling</em></strong>,2004, and <strong><em>Regalo</em></strong> (The Gift), 2012. As a children&rsquo;s ensemble, CLAP also serves as the channel for the children&rsquo;s program of ARTIST Inc, which focuses on the development of children&rsquo;s creativity and artistic skills and provides a venue for children to share their observations and insights on history, and the realities of the communities that they are part of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also community-based children&rsquo;s theater groups whose objective is to educate not only the young but also the rest of the Filipino community on children&rsquo;s issues and basic rights, and helping children deal with their grave plight. The Dulang Pambata sa Bagong Barrio and the Dulang Bata ng Robina organized childrenof workers in Robina Farms, the children&rsquo;s groups among the urban poor, such as those in Tatalon, Dagat-dagatan, and Smokey Mountain, as well as a theater project to teach and entertain street children, providing a viable alternative to the streets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another theater group that addresses a particular group of the children sector is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3289\">Teatro Akebono</a>, the theater arm of the Development Action for Women Network (DAWN), a nongovernment organization (NGO) that was established on 6 Feb 1996 to help Filipino women migrants in Japan and their Japanese-Filipino children (JFC). Teatro Akebono has mounted several plays since its creation in 1997, among them <strong><em>Sana &hellip; Isang Kuwento ng Pangarap</em></strong> (I Wish &hellip; A Story of a Dream), 2008, a musical play about the life of Yuki, a Japanese-Filipino girl, who dreams of meeting her Japanese father amidst discrimination in school and in her community. Other musical plays were developed collectively by the participants themselves, including children, during theater workshops. These were <strong><em>Walang Iwanan</em></strong> (No One Leaves), 2000; <strong><em>The Ugly Duckling: A Journey of Hero, JFC</em></strong>, 2001; <strong><em>Pagsilay ng Bagong Pag-asa</em></strong> (The Dawn of a New Hope), 2002; <strong><em>Ang Maskara</em></strong> (The Mask), 2003; <strong><em>The Magic Ring</em></strong>, 2005; <strong><em>Ten Years of Joy: JFC Stories and DAWN Memories</em></strong>, 2006; <strong><em>The Gift</em></strong>, 2007; and <strong><em>JFC World</em></strong>, 2008. In 2009, the group staged <strong><em>The Crane Dog</em></strong>, a fable about a female dog and a male crane falling in love and being separated after having a child, a hybrid cranedog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although Teatro Akebono had several presentations in schools and communities in Metro Manila, most of its productions ran through the course of its theater tours in various prefectures and cities in Japan. These tours, which began in Oct 1998, were not only occasions to stage plays, but opportunities as well for some JFC to finally meet their Japanese fathers. Since 1998, Teatro Akebono has trained about 20 JFCs, performed for both Filipino and Japanese audiences, brought 6-9 children on the Japan tour, and helped 1-3 JFCs reunite with their fathers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Government Institution-Based Children&rsquo;s Theater.</strong> One puppet theater group based in a government institution is the Black Theater of Manila, founded in 1978 by the Philippine Information Agency. Aimed at disseminating information to children, the group, comprising young adults under Lolit Aquino, has staged plays on topics such as nutrition, parenthood, dental care, care for the disabled, the Balik-Probinsiya (Return to the Provinces) movement of the government, and folktales. With the use of puppets, the group started with <strong><em>Kainan Na!</em></strong> (Eating Time!), a show on nutrition, and has since gone on nationwide tours and appeared on television shows, such as <strong><em>Batang Pinoy</em></strong> (Filipino Child) and <strong><em>Tok-Tok Karatok</em></strong>. Part of the group&rsquo;s repertoire are the stories of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1849\">Bernardo Carpio</a>, <strong><em>Awit ng Adarna</em></strong> (Song of the Adarna Bird), <strong><em>Magigue</em></strong>, <strong><em>Aming Pasko</em></strong> (Our Christmas), <strong><em>Tatlong Biik</em></strong> (Three Little Pigs), <strong><em>Mariang Alimango</em></strong> (Maria the Crab), and <strong><em>Smile Ato</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Theater as Therapy.</strong> A special category of children&rsquo;s theater is theater used as therapy, such as the theater developed in the 1980s for &ldquo;special&rdquo; children&mdash;victims of violence, witnesses to family deaths from military clashes or political torture, or themselves survivors of torture, harassment, or grave physical injury. Theater for these children&mdash;as well as for street children and those pulled into child labor&mdash;is usually organized by NGOs such as Gabriela, the Parents Alternative Inc, and the Children&rsquo;s Rehabilitation Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another example is the Samahan ng mga Anak ng Desaparecidos, the children&rsquo;s theater group of Families of Victims of Involuntary Disappearances. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2892\">Edwin Decenteceo</a> trained children, ages 12-18, and mounted street theater performances about their lives, all of whom had lost their fathers or brothers to involuntary disappearances. The group performed at the Baclaran Church, Mendiola, and other sites where rallies for victims of human rights abuses were held.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In these theater activities, games and sharing stories are used as therapy for children, enabling them to open up their lives to others, deal with their own problems and trauma, and resolve their emotions toward their experiences. The stories may be developed into a common story or a chosen life story, then mounted and rehearsed as a play. A case on record is that of a lone survivor from a Cagayan Valley massacre, who used the mime movements she learned in theater sessions to emerge from a state of shock and share her story with human rights groups. The latter documented what happened and filed a case against the soldiers responsible for the massacre of an entire family. It took almost six months for the child to enact the memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources of Children&rsquo;s Theater.</strong> There are several trends in children&rsquo;s theater based on the source of material for the productions. Theater perfomances presented by adults for children often contain folk material, as seen in Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Manok at ang Lawin</em></strong> (The Chicken and the Hawk), <strong><em>Ang Magkakapatid at ang Tsonggo</em></strong> (The Siblings and the Monkey), and <strong><em>Kung Paano Pinatay ng mga Ibaloi ang Higante</em></strong> (How the Ibaloi Killed the Giant), all staged in 1974 at UP; and those of Bienvenido Portugal, written for and staged at the CCP, such as the <strong><em>Korido</em></strong>,1987, which uses&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido&nbsp;</em>(metrical tales) characters like Don Juan Te&ntilde;oso, Bernardo Carpio, and Mariang Kalabasa; and <strong><em>Bidasari</em></strong>,1988, which draws from the epics <strong><em>Indarapatra at Sulayman</em></strong> (Indarapatra and Sulayman) and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1858\"><strong>Darangen</strong></a></em></strong>,and from various awit and korido. Other children&rsquo;s plays based on folk literature are Christine Bellen&rsquo;s <strong><em>Si Pilandok at ang Bayan ng <strong>Bulawan</strong></em></strong> (Pilandok and the Town of Gold), 2010, by Ateneo <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2921\">ENTABLADO</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3070\">Liza Magtoto</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dugtong-Dugtong na Sumbong</em></strong> (Series of Complaints), 2010, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a>; and Arthur Cassanova&rsquo;s <strong><em>Si Kusog at ang Mahiwagang Bakawan</em></strong> (Kusog and the Magic Mangrove), <strong><em>Ang Paglilitis sa Hukuman ni Sinukuan</em></strong> (The Trial in the Court of Sinukuan), <strong><em>Ang Mahiwagang Tandang</em></strong> (The Magic Rooster), <strong><em>Si Diwatakasalipan at si Tarabuasao</em></strong> (Diwatakasalipan and Tarabuasao), and <strong><em>Si Juan Bahag</em></strong> (John Loincloth), all presented in 2015 by the Singhay Dapi<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/447\"><strong>t</strong></a>an. In such plays, the material is chosen for entertainment and learning values, and presented in ways that teach the children both the desired content and the forms and delights of theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some foreign children&rsquo;s stories and animated works were adapted on stage for the Filipino audience. Among them are <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3328\">Trumpets</a> Playshop&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em></strong>, 1997, <strong><em>The Little Mermaid</em></strong>, 2001, <strong><em>Honk</em></strong>, 2003, and <strong><em>The Bluebird Happiness</em></strong>, 2013; Tanghalang Pilipino&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mulan</em></strong>, 2007, and <strong><em>Pinocchio, Gusto Mo Bang Maging Tao?</em></strong> (Pinocchio, Do You Want to Be a Human Being?); 2009; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Gantimpala Theater Foundation</a>&#39;s&nbsp;<strong><em>Si Snow White at ang Pitong Dwarfs</em></strong> (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), 2011, and <strong><em>Si Jack at ang Mahiwagang Beanstalk</em></strong> (Jack and the Magic Beanstalk), 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some plays are based on Philippine literature and history. Bellen adapted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s stories in <strong><em><strong><strong>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</strong></strong></em></strong> (Stories of Grandma Basyang), 2006. Three stories were selected from Reyes&rsquo;s collection: &ldquo;Ang Prinsipeng Mahaba ang Ilong&rdquo; (The Long-Nosed Prince), &ldquo;Binibining Tumalo sa Mahal na Hari&rdquo; (The Lady Who Defeated the King), and &ldquo;Ang Prinsipeng Duwag&rdquo; (The Coward Prince). The play&rsquo;s musical score was composed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3922\">Noel Cabangon</a>. Bellen then retold the life of the Philippine national hero in <strong><em>Batang Rizal</em></strong> (Young Rizal), 2007, to emphasize the ideals of heroism and patriotism among children. The play was directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3308\">Dudz Tera&ntilde;a</a>, scored by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4378\">Vince de Jesus</a>, and animated by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3754\">Don Salubayba</a> and the Anino Shadow Collective. Both plays were produced by PETA, with <strong><em>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</em></strong> being one of its longest running plays to date. Bellen also adapted Rene Villanueva&rsquo;s <strong><em>Unang Baboy sa Langit</em></strong> (First Pig in Heaven), 2009, for Ateneo&rsquo;s ENTABLADO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Published Filipino children&rsquo;s books are also rich sources for the theater. The CCP and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/384\">Silliman University</a> presented <strong><em>Ampalaya: The Musical</em></strong>, 2014, an adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5648\">Augie Rivera</a>&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s book about the legend of the&nbsp;<em>ampalaya&nbsp;</em>(bitter gourd), published by Adarna House. Directed by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3188\">Dessa Quesada-Palm</a>, with music by Michael Dadap and libretto by Patty Yusah (with Dadap), the play explores the themes of envy and greed and of nurturing one&rsquo;s gifts and strengths, through the creative use of melodies, costumes, and animation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children&rsquo;s theater productions and practices in the Philippines prove that even for children, theater is meant not only to entertain young audiences but also to educate and transform them into agents of change.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

Building on the concept of &#x201C;drama in education,&#x201D; or DIE, which began in the United States and Europe in the 1960s, theater has been integrated into the curriculum as a method of teaching, specifically in the language, social studies, and humanities courses in Grades IV, V, VI, and VII. As part of the curriculum, all students are required to attend and participate in their particular level&#x2019;s annual production, for which classroom discussions and homeroom assignments are given and graded at the start and end of the production. During their particular production months, formal classroom procedures are stopped (except in the math and science subjects) to give both the students and teachers time to work on the play.

A case on record is that of a lone survivor from a Cagayan Valley massacre, who used the mime movements she learned in theater sessions to emerge from a state of shock and share her story with human rights groups. The latter documented what happened and filed a case against the soldiers responsible for the massacre of an entire family. It took almost six months for the child to enact the memory."

		"text": "<p>The <strong>dotoc</strong> is a religious devotion to the Holy Cross. Every year in April and May, communities in the Bicol region of the Philippines perform the dotocfor nine days. The term &ldquo;dotoc&rdquo; is an archaic Bikol word for pilgrimage, the narrative contained in the dotocas cultural performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2008, there were at least four active dotoc practices: the <strong>cobacho dotoc</strong> in Baao, the dotoc as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> in Nabua, the dotoc and <strong>lagaylay</strong> in Canaman, Camarines Sur, and the dotoc and komedya in Bigaa, Legazpi City in Albay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic narrative is that of a pilgrimage: a group of pilgrims sets out to look for the Holy Cross, finds it, and, upon finding it, adores and praises it and submits their petitions for peace, justice, prosperity, good health, and deliverance from evil. All of the four dotoc forms follow this narrative, but they can be further grouped into two: (1) those that tell of the pilgrimage of ordinary, unnamed folk, and (2) those that depict the pilgrimage of Elena and Constantino. The second group takes on the form of the komedya. Distinct from the above dotoc is the lagaylay of Canaman and nearby towns of Camarines Sur, whose action is set at the end of the pilgrimage, after the cross is found.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Cobacho <strong>Dotoc</strong> of Baao.</strong> The cobacho dotoc text tells of a group of pilgrims who journey to the Holy Land to visit the Holy Cross. On their way, the pilgrims come upon a <strong>cobacho</strong> (shed/shelter) with people inside. The pilgrims are dissuaded by the people in the cobacho, who heard that the Cross had been stolen. The pilgrims refute this by saying the Cross that had been stolen has already been recovered, and they proceed to recount the tale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the narrative, the Holy Cross was stolen and brought to Persia by the Persian king Cosrohas (Chosroes), who conquered Byzantine territory. The emperor Heraclio (Heraclius, Byzantine emperor from 610 to 641 AD) waged war against Persia and won. Cosrohas was killed by his son Serwis, who then ruled Persia; Serwis then surrendered all to Heraclio, including the Holy Cross, which was then returned by the emperor to the Holy Land. The emperor attempted to carry the Cross up Calvary as Jesus did, but could not do it until he shed his rich clothes, ornaments, and crown to become like Jesus, who was a poor man. After the tale of Heraclio is told, the people in the cobachojoin the pilgrims. Upon reaching the Holy Land, they praise and adore the Cross and adorn it with flowers. They then sing the &ldquo;Vexilla Regis&rdquo; (Royal Banner), offer their petitions for mercy and blessings in the &ldquo;Pasion,&rdquo; and end by singing the &ldquo;Adios.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Vexilla Regis&rdquo; is the Latin hymn composed in 569 CE by the poet and bishop of Poitiers, Venantius Fortunatus (530-609 CE), to celebrate the receipt in a solemn procession of a relic of the True Cross (Rousseau 1967, 635).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specific directions for the performance are given in a surviving copy of a printed text (Dotoc 1895). The <strong>patanid</strong> (instructions) call for two pairs of <strong>paradotoc</strong> (women cantors) to start at a distance from the altar, in an <strong>enramada</strong> (roofed structure); to walk slowly to the cobacho constructed midway between the starting point and the altar; to stop there and have a &ldquo;conversation&rdquo; with two other pairs of paradotoc; and then for all of the paradotoc to process to the altar, the &ldquo;Holy Land&rdquo; wherein they &ldquo;find&rdquo; the Cross. At the cobacho, there should be a table on which will be placed <strong>bandera</strong> (flags) and <strong>media luna</strong> (half-moons) arranged in an alternating position, and various flowers to be offered at the altar when the paradotoc reach it. The instructions for the action appear in the text from the beginning to the departure scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;Pasion de Dotoc&rdquo; comprises praises and adoration of the Holy Cross and petitions for graces in this life and in the hereafter. The &ldquo;Adios&rdquo; is the leave-taking, whose last two quatrains bid farewell to the Holy Cross, coming after the petitions for mercy so that the paradotocmay &ldquo;attain the glory of heaven now and forever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All copies of the dotoc text are called <strong>orihinal</strong> (original). The last printed copy is most probably the 1939 print by an Imprenta La Sinceridad of Tabaco, Albay (Recepcion 1997), but most paradotoc have not seen any printed copy of the text&mdash;only orihinal copied by hand and passed down from mother to daughter, or among peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The language used is Naga Bikol, which is the Bikol used by the Church and claimed by many to be the lingua franca Bikol. The orthography generally follows the orthodox Hispanized spelling of Bikol words. The verses are octosyllabic, generally monorhymed quatrains, arranged in sets of four, each quatrain sung by a row of cantors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cobacho Dotoc in Tinago</strong>. In Tinago, Bigaa, Legazpi City, the cobacho dotoc is performed using exactly the same text used in Baao, but with an altogether different performance. The dotoc of Tinago is actually a combination of the dotoc and komedya. The cobacho dotoc is performed at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening between the main body of the komedya and the concluding scene on the &ldquo;Holy Land,&rdquo; where the dotoc singers join the komedya performers for a grand finale. The dotoc <strong>cantoras</strong> are teenage girls who sing the lines with <strong>lamano</strong> (hand gestures) and at certain parts they wave the paper flags and half-moons. The girls walk briskly on the dark path leading to the altar, with boys lighting the way with gas lamps (petromax).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dotoc in Canaman.</strong> In Canaman, the dotoc is an action prayer consisting of praises and petitions offered to the Cross. The lines are sung all throughout, with some parts recited (Mampo 1980, 61-62). A <strong>notador</strong> or <strong>maestra</strong> (teacher) dictates the lines to the performers, the resulting effect being a rhythm of sung lines and the notador&rsquo;s dictation. The performance is held for nine days, using a text for each of the first eight days and a choice of nine more for the ninth day. The action progresses from the women cantors expressing a desire to adore the Cross and then doing so for the first two days, to the women going in search of the Cross, which they find and adore, on the third day, and variations of the search and finding on the fourth to the ninth (Mampo 1980, 66). All &ldquo;action&rdquo; happens in the <strong>engramada</strong>, or roofed performance space, and the &ldquo;journey&rdquo; or walking is a mere few steps toward the front of the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Dotoc as <strong>Komedya</strong> in Baras and Tinago</strong>. The dotoc as komedya depicts Elena&rsquo;s finding of the Cross. It is performed in Baras, Nabua, and in Tinago, Bigaa, in Legazpi City. The Baras performance has two parts: Elena and Constantino&rsquo;s battle with a Moorish Emperadora, and the pilgrimage to find the Cross. In Bigaa, the komedya covers only the pilgrimage to the Holy Land. The Bigaa folk call their performance &ldquo;komedya,&rdquo; while the Baras folk refer to it only as &ldquo;dotoc.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The action of the dotoc as komedya is focused on the encounter between the Christians (Elena, Constantino, and their troops) and Moors (the Emperadora and her troops) and on the embassies sent by both parties to each other, first for the battle and then afterward, at the defeat of the latter, for the terms of surrender. This first part ends with the Emperadora and her troops being converted to Elena&rsquo;s religion. The second part consists of the pilgrimage to find the Cross of Jesus. Here, tension is provided by the refusal of an old man to reveal what he knows of the whereabouts of the Cross. Elena directs the soldiers to put him in a well and starve him for three days. He relents and leads the entourage to the &ldquo;mountain.&rdquo; Elena orders the soldiers and ladies-in-waiting to dig in the area pointed out by the old man, and they find three crosses, three nails, and the crown of thorns, leaving them confused as to which of the three crosses found is Christ&rsquo;s. God sends an angel who tells them to have a sick person kiss the three crosses; the one that heals him is the True Cross. They also test the crosses on a dead person; the cross able to resurrect the dead is Christ&rsquo;s Cross.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Lagaylay in Canaman.</strong> In the lagaylay, Elena and her entourage sing and dance their prayers in front of the newly found cross (Realubit 1976, 418). Santa Elena is joined by a pair of spokeswomen called <strong>respondes</strong>, a pair of flag bearers/wavers called <strong>paraduyag</strong>, and four to six pairs of <strong>panamparan</strong> or guards of honor. Praises to the Cross are sung in repeated stanzas, which have sections where the performers, generally referred to as cantoras (singers), form themselves into the letters of the word S-T-A-C-R-U-Z, and finally into a cross formation. There are also sections for flag waving, for blessing the Cross with incense carried by the respondes, for reciting verses, for offering flowers, and finally&mdash;the highlight of the lagaylay&mdash;for Elena to offer her crown to the Cross as a sign of her humility. The cantoras dance, kneel, or stand as they sing the lines that they have memorized (there is no notador or prompter). The performance is capped off with a square dance, in the style of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/90\"><strong>rigodon de honor</strong></a>, by Elena and the rest of the pilgrims.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3058\">Jazmin Badong Llana</a></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3058\"> </a></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>See also</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/433\">Hispanic Traditions and Transformations in Philippine Theater (1565 Onward)</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/700\">The Bicol Dotoc: Performance, Postcoloniality, and Pilgrimage</a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources: </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>Dato, Luis G. 1972. &ldquo;Bikol Orthography: Problems and Exercises.&rdquo; In <em>Readings on Bicol Culture</em>, edited by Luis General Jr, 137-46.

All of the four dotoc forms follow this narrative, but they can be further grouped into two: (1) those that tell of the pilgrimage of ordinary, unnamed folk, and (2) those that depict the pilgrimage of Elena and Constantino. The second group takes on the form of the komedya. Distinct from the above dotoc is the lagaylay of Canaman and nearby towns of Camarines Sur, whose action is set at the end of the pilgrimage, after the cross is found."

Cosrohas was killed by his son Serwis, who then ruled Persia; Serwis then surrendered all to Heraclio, including the Holy Cross, which was then returned by the emperor to the Holy Land. The emperor attempted to carry the Cross up Calvary as Jesus did, but could not do it until he shed his rich clothes, ornaments, and crown to become like Jesus, who was a poor man. After the tale of Heraclio is told, the people in the cobachojoin the pilgrims. Upon reaching the Holy Land, they praise and adore the Cross and adorn it with flowers.

This first part ends with the Emperadora and her troops being converted to Elena&#x2019;s religion. The second part consists of the pilgrimage to find the Cross of Jesus. Here, tension is provided by the refusal of an old man to reveal what he knows of the whereabouts of the Cross. Elena directs the soldiers to put him in a well and starve him for three days. He relents and leads the entourage to the &#x201C;mountain.&#x201D; Elena orders the soldiers and ladies-in-waiting to dig in the area pointed out by the old man, and they find three crosses, three nails, and the crown of thorns, leaving them confused as to which of the three crosses found is Christ&#x2019;s.

		"text": "<p>In the vernacular tradition, <strong>drama</strong> refers to one specific type of traditional play, which uses prose dialogue and focuses on Filipino characters and situations. Although &ldquo;drama&rdquo; in contemporary theater refers to the literary genre of enacted fiction, the term refers to just one kind of play in the local tradition. It has also been called <strong>dulang pang-araw-araw</strong> (drama of everyday life), <strong>dulang kataw-anan</strong> (comedy) or <strong>dulang mahinuk-logon</strong> (tragedy), and, depending on the content, <strong>dulang social</strong>, <strong>lirico</strong>, <strong>romantico</strong>,and <strong>politikal</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drama in Philippine folk theater is a versatile form that has through history dealt with a range of subject matter with prose as principal medium, although verse has been used, solely or in combination with prose. Along with the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, it was introduced during the Spanish colonial period by traveling troupes from Spain. In the 19th century, Spanish (Calderon de la Barca, Lope de Vega, Rojas Zorrilla, Ruiz de Alarcon) and other European (Corneille, Goethe, Moli&eacute;re, Schiller, Shakespeare) plays were published in the local Spanish-language journal <strong><em>La Oceania Espa&ntilde;ola</em></strong>,and thus made available to local readers. Spanish plays were also performed by visiting troupes from Spain, and eventually local playwrights, both&nbsp;<em>peninsulares&nbsp;</em>(Spanish born in Spain) and&nbsp;<em>insulares&nbsp;</em>(Spanish born in the Philippines)&mdash; Manuel Romero, Camilo Millan, Jose Conde, Mariano Garcia, Eduardo Saavedra, Eduardo Casta&ntilde;er&mdash;were writing dramas about Philippine life and mores. Saavedra&rsquo;s <strong>revista comico lirica</strong> (comic-lyric review), for example, staged in Iloilo in March 1896, was called <strong><em>A 7 con 7 el Pico</em></strong> (Seven Pesos and Seven Reales a Picul), because it was about local currency and sugar prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>By the turn of the century, Filipino playwrights were writing dramas in their own languages about various aspects of their daily lives. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3202\">Tomas Remigio</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/615\"><strong><em>Mga Santong Tao</em></strong></a> (People Saints), 1901, in mixed verse and prose, is the story of Ambrosio and Titay, a poor couple. To compound the travails of poverty, Titay is being courted by the&nbsp;<em>cura&nbsp;</em>(priest), the&nbsp;<em>sakristan mayor&nbsp;</em>(head sacristan), and the&nbsp;<em>piskal&nbsp;</em>(prosecutor). The couple give the three adjacent &ldquo;visiting hours,&rdquo; and each knock on the door sends the incumbent visitor scurrying to hide in a room filled with holy images. At the end, some church people arrive to borrow statues for the procession, and find the three men frozen in the guises of a Nazareno, a Christ on the Cross, and an Ecce Homo&mdash;all suffering, if not Christlike, and well aware that Ambrosio and Titay had their sweet vengeance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\"><strong>drama simboliko</strong></a> of 1902-1906 that the American insular government saw as &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; was also <strong>drama politikal</strong>, using allegory and symbol to present the current realities of the American occupation and colonization. Famous examples of these dramas that reinterpreted the usual love story of the drama according to the political forces of its time are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2711\">Juan Abad</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/673\"><strong><em>Tanikalang Guinto</em></strong></a> (Golden Chain), 1902, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2862\">Juan Matapang Cruz</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/560\"><strong><em>Hindi Aco Patay</em></strong></a> (I Am Not Dead), both 1903. A political drama that reinterpreted Jesus Christ as a local labor leader was Tolentino&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/510\"><strong>Bagong Cristo</strong></a></em></strong>, 1907.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The succeeding decades saw drama being written for the theaters, the drama groups, and for school and civic occasions. Many dwelt on romantic and/or comic situations&mdash;for example, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang <strong><strong>Sampaguita</strong></strong></em></strong> (The Sampaguita), 1901, about parted lovers who are enabled to come together again by a keepsake of sampaguitas; and his <strong><em>Huwag Lang Lugi sa Puhunan</em></strong> (As Long As I Get My Capital Back), 1905, about Sinangko, a Chinese, who is in love with Miguela, and lends money to her aunt, Pascuala. When Miguela marries a boy she loves, Sinangko marries Pascuala in order not to lose his investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The themes of betrayed love, the fallen but reformed woman, parental obstruction, love triangles, and the like, which later prevailed in Filipino&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\">komiks</a>&nbsp;</em>and movies, first emerged here. So do less usual themes like that of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3215\">Jose Ma. Rivera</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Bayan</em></strong> (Country), 1916, about events and attitudes within a household in which one brother is a revolutionary, the other a fence-sitter, and the sister an eventual convert to the cause; or that of Maximo Sevilla&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sino ang May Kasalanan?</em></strong> (Who Is at Fault?), in which the characters serve as vehicles for ideas on the national language, on economic nationalism, on the rich, and on corrupt leadership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well-known and current even after their own times were the comedies of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>, like <strong><em>Ang Palabas ni Suwan</em></strong> (Suwan&rsquo;s Show), <strong><em>Dahil sa&nbsp;<strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong></em></strong> (For Love of a Child), 1944, and <strong><em>Sangkuwaltang Abaka</em></strong> (An Armful of Hemp), which in 1943 became the famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/665\"><strong><em>Sino Ba Kayo?</em></strong></a> (Who Are You All?), with multiple doors, confusions, and mistaken identities that recall the French farce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3152\">Cirio Panganiban</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/684\"><strong>Veronidia</strong></a></em></strong>,1919, is well-known because of its success and its dealing with the question of divorce, the Divorce Bill having been presented in the National Assembly in 1912. Veronidia, the lead character, is a&nbsp;<em>divorciada&nbsp;</em>(divorc&eacute;e), separated from Rosello, and now living with Cristino. When Rosello takes ill, she is torn between wishing to visit his deathbed, and considering the feelings of Cristino, who has given up parents and career for her. The play was first presented in Panganiban&rsquo;s hometown, Bocaue, Bulacan, on 30 Dec 1919, but its resounding success came when presented by the literary society <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5389\">Ilawat Panitik</a> at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Zorrilla</a> in 1927, with <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang<strong>&nbsp;</strong>de la Rama</a> in the principal roles. Aside from the stars, its success lay in the cogent social history it bears. It reflects the concerns, clothes, manners, and atmosphere of the time, as well as the humanity in the characters&rsquo; individual anguish. <strong><em>Veronidia</em></strong> suggests the role that the drama played for its audiences of the first four decades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike other theater forms, the drama played back lives across the footlights&mdash;men and women, fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, lovers and rivals in current costumes, occupations, and concerns. Together with the sarsuwela, the drama gave the Filipino audience its first taste of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\">realism</a>. If the endings were too often manipulated by revelations, coincidences, and the like (near deus ex machina), and seemed too often too happy, they at least featured the men and women and situations of&nbsp;<em>pang-araw-araw na buhay&nbsp;</em>(everyday life).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drama lives on today, in the plays that continue to be written by folk playwrights in the provinces, as well as in more sophisticated urban versions being written by student and professional playwrights for city stages, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5627\">Claro M.

Along with the <a href=\"/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, it was introduced during the Spanish colonial period by traveling troupes from Spain. In the 19th century, Spanish (Calderon de la Barca, Lope de Vega, Rojas Zorrilla, Ruiz de Alarcon) and other European (Corneille, Goethe, Moli&#xE9;re, Schiller, Shakespeare) plays were published in the local Spanish-language journal <strong><em>La Oceania Espa&#xF1;ola</em></strong>,and thus made available to local readers. Spanish plays were also performed by visiting troupes from Spain, and eventually local playwrights, both&#xA0;<em>peninsulares&#xA0;</em>(Spanish born in Spain) and&#xA0;<em>insulares&#xA0;</em>(Spanish born in the Philippines)&#x2014; Manuel Romero, Camilo Millan, Jose Conde, Mariano Garcia, Eduardo Saavedra, Eduardo Casta&#xF1;er&#x2014;were writing dramas about Philippine life and mores.

		"text": "<p>The term <strong>drama simboliko</strong> refers to allegorical <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a>, especially that which was called &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; by the American insular government in the first decade. Most of these plays were banned, and their playwrights jailed, because their &ldquo;unmistakable tendency,&rdquo; the American-dominated Supreme Court decision said, was to &ldquo;inculcate a spirit of hatred and enmity against the American people and the Government of the United States in the Philippines, and &hellip; incite the people of the Philippine Islands to open and armed resistance to the constituted authorities, and to induce them to conspire together for the secret organization of armed forces &hellip; for the purpose of overthrowing the present Government and setting up another in its stead.&rdquo; These first nationalist Philippine dramas were cognizant of and eloquent about the concept of and the need for nation, their playwrights and audiences undeterred by the arrests, closure, and imprisonment they suffered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The historical events that led to these dramas started with the failure of the Reform Movement to win reforms from Spain; the arrest, banishment, and eventual execution of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>; the Philippine Revolution against Spain, 1896-98; the declaration of Philippine Independence in 1898; American entry into the country as &ldquo;friends&rdquo; of the Filipinos against Spain; and the Treaty of Paris in 1898, through which Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States without consultation with the Filipino people. This was followed by the Philippine-American War, identified by American documents as the &ldquo;Philippine Insurrection,&rdquo; which, with Theodore Roosevelt&rsquo;s declaration of general amnesty in 1902, ended officially but not actually, since the Filipinos continued to fight until about 1907.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The period between 1902 and 1906 was the era of &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; drama. It was a form of guerrilla warfare directly contrary to Act 292, the Sedition Act, which made advocacy of Philippine independence a crime. Section 10 was later to be invoked in the arrest of the anti-American dramatists: &ldquo;it shall be unlawful for any person to advance orally or by writing or printing or like methods, the independence of the Philippine Islands or their separation from the United States &hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2711\">Juan Abad</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/673\"><strong><em>Tanikalang Guinto</em></strong></a> (Golden Chain), first staged at the Teatro Libertad on 7 July 1902, and subsequently in other theaters in Manila and the provinces, had its Batangas, Batangas, performance on 10 May 1903 closed down, and the author indicted for sedition. While the case was pending in court, Abad, out under bail, wrote <strong><em>Isang Punglo ng Kaaway</em></strong> (An Enemy&rsquo;s Bullet), which was produced at the Teatro Rizal in Malabon on 8 May 1904, leading to Abad&rsquo;s second arrest. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/560\"><strong><em>Hindi Aco Patay</em></strong></a> (I Am Not Dead) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2862\">Juan Matapang Cruz</a>, when presented on 8 May 1903 at the Teatro Nueva Luna in Malabon, caused a riot, the arrest of the theater manager, the banning of the play, and the confiscation of the props, among them Katipunan flags and revolutionary emblems. Ten of the actors and the author were later arrested. Cruz served his two-year sentence in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow) played to a packed house on 4 May 1903 at the Teatro Libertad, and caused the arrest of members of the company and of Tolentino, who was charged with sedition and found guilty. Among other plays suppressed were <strong><em>Ang <strong><strong>Kala</strong></strong>yaang Hindi Natupad</em></strong> (The Freedom Not Attained), closed in Obando, Bulacan, on 15 May 1903; <strong><em>Pulong <strong>Pinaglahuan</strong></em></strong> (Island Subjugated), raided in Navotas, Rizal, on 23 Jan 1904, after which 20 performers and the author, Mariano Martinez, were arrested; <strong><em>Dahas ng Pilak</em></strong> (Silver Force), closed at the Teatro Nueva Luna in Malabon, Rizal, on 1 May 1904 with 11 actors, the author and manager arrested; and <strong><em>Ang Katipunan</em></strong> (The Katipunan) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5306\">Gabriel Beato Francisco</a>, staged on 21 Feb 1905 at Laoag, Ilocos Norte, at which the entire audience was reportedly arrested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In form, these plays were drama: largely prose, although they used some patriotic songs&mdash;for example, the forbidden &ldquo;Himno Nacional,&rdquo; which was not in the script but was inserted when the American Military Police were not in sight. Their plots were based on the love situations popular in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>,but the names and relationships elevated the characters and situations to symbol, allegory, and statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus in <strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong>, Inangbayan (Mother Country) is mother to Taga-ilog (the Filipino people), who is imprisoned by Dilat-na-bulag (Spain) at the instigation of Halimau (Spanish friar), and betrayed by Asalhayop and Dahumpalay (Filipino traitors). In <strong><em><strong>Tanikalang Guinto</strong></em></strong>, Liwanag (Light, Spirit of Independence) is kept from marrying Kaulayaw (Filipino revolutionary) by her uncle Maimbot (American government) aided by Kaulayaw&rsquo;s brother Nagtapon (Filipino mercenary).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the komedya and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, these plays won their audiences with visual spectacle, but this time loaded with hope and meaning: the red sun of the Katipunan rising; Diwa and Liwanag ascending in a bubble as devils take Nagtapon, and Kamatayan claims Maimbot; tombs opening as Inangbayan falls; and the Philippine flag being formed onstage by girls garbed in the appropriate colors and quickly going in and out of formation. Although the traditional theater conventions used were familiar to the people, they were infused with symbol and meaning, and the message they bore&mdash;the need to fight the new colonizers and gain independence&mdash;was new, and as current as the day&rsquo;s newspapers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definitely new was this concern: national in dimension, political in character, with persuasion and action as goals. Unlike indigenous drama, the drama simboliko was not limited to regional or community boundaries. Unlike the colonial drama of the Spanish period, it was not about Christianity or the loves and wars of European nobility. It was anti-American because it was pro-Filipino, pro-independence, and for freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When in 1907 the first Philippine Assembly was inaugurated, this political allegorical drama ceased, because the fight for independence transferred from the battlefields and drama stages to the halls of legislation and negotiation, closing a proud chapter of protest in Philippine theater history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drama simboliko has not ceased to exist, however. Some of the &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; plays were revived, with new meaning, in the Marcos regime. <strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong> has been shown whole and in parts, with Taga-ilog obviously symbolizing as well the political prisoners of the Marcos regime, and Halimaw the cruelty of their jailers. As presented by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">PETA</a> in 1990, Taga-ilog was played by three actors, representing the struggle of the Filipino people in different periods of the country&rsquo;s history. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Estados Unidos bersus Cruz, Abad at Tolentino</em></strong> (United States versus Cruz, Abad and Tolentino), 1981, examines the phenomenon of protest theater, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3352\">Rody Vera</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Isang Rihersal</em></strong> (A Rehearsal), 1982, the revival of nationalist plays&mdash;both by building their plays around bits of &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; dramas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those periods of Philippine history when speaking directly was not possible, the drama simboliko showed the power of symbol and the currency of theater.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>duplo</strong> is a form of folk <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> usually played on the final night of the traditional nine-day wake for the dead. It is customary among the Filipinos to give a feast on the ninth day after the death of a loved one. Relatives and friends gather in the house of the bereaved family, and various forms of amusement are prepared to pass the time away. The duplo is primarily aimed at entertaining the family and friends of the departed. This celebratory mood during the wake is consistent with pre-Spanish accounts on the death and burial rituals of early Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some speculate that the duplo began in the middle of the 18th century and reached its peak in the late 19th century. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Balmaseda</a> believes that the game was developed by the&nbsp;<em>ladinos&nbsp;</em>or poets who wrote in Spanish and Tagalog, because of the prevalence of Spanish terms used in the game. It is also highly possible that duplo came after the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>(<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical tale</a>) and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\"><strong>pasyon</strong></a> since these two forms were common sources of arguments for the poetic debate. A more convincing evidence that the game was practiced in the 18th century was an account that mentioned the prohibition by the archbishop of Manila in 1741 of the practice of duplo without the permission of the religious authorities. It is said that such a restriction was a result of the anti-church content of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Early literary historians noted the decline of the duplo in the 20th century. This prompted scholars to study and produce master texts of the duplo. The first written documentation was by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>, published in <strong><em>El Renacimiento Filipino</em></strong>, 1913, and was followed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5332\">Teodoro Gener</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Duplo</strong>&rsquo;t <strong>Balagtasan</strong></em></strong>, 1948. In the 1960s, there were efforts to revive the duplo. In 10 May 1964, the Cultural Affairs Office of the Manila City Government, led by Mayor Anonio Villegas, conducted a&nbsp;<em>pambansang duplohan&nbsp;</em>(national duplo competition). It was staged at the Luneta Grandstand to commemorate the 67th death anniversary of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5124\">Andres Bonifacio</a>. Seven <strong>duplero</strong> (duplo poets), aged 28 to 74, from various parts of the Philippines, participated in the event. Likewise, teachers and students of the Far Eastern University (FEU) established the FEU Duplo Group to revive this dramatic form. They performed the duplo in various places and for different occasions. The most recent performance of an actual duplo that happened in Barrio Lawang, Kupang, San Antonio, Nueva Ecija, was documented by Vivencio Jose in 1975.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the information about the earlier duplo came from Balmaseda&rsquo;s accounts published in &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/76/1672\">Ang Tatlong Panahon ng Tulang Tagalog</a>&rdquo; and Gener&rsquo;s classic work. It is usually held in an open space beside the house where the wake takes place. A temporary and improvised structure made of bamboo and local fronds is built to provide protective cover for the guests and for the performance. Under this structure, two benches are placed on opposite sides. A table is positioned in the middle, on top of which one can find a <strong>palmatorya</strong>, a piece of wood with a round and flat head and a handle, or a single slipper, or a piece of bamboo to be used for meting out a punishment. This entire space is sometimes called a <strong>kaharian</strong> (kingdom).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play, or <strong>laro</strong> (game), begins when the <strong>hari</strong> (king) holds the palmatorya in his hand. He introduces the game, its objectives, and the rules to be followed. Prayers are also offered for the soul of the departed. After this, the hari presents a situation, such as the loss of a healing rose or the death of his pet parrot. This is followed by a <strong>numeracion</strong> or counting off by several duplero, also called <strong>belyako</strong> and <strong>belyaka</strong>, who are seated on opposite sides of the table. The participants will then be acknowledged according to their number, such as <strong>primero belyako</strong> (first belyako) or <strong>primera belyaka</strong> (first belyaka). When all the participants have been identified, the hari hurls the first accusation, usually, to a belyako. The accused belyako has to defend himself, and in turn, accuses another participant, usually a belyaka. But before making the accusation, the duplero will deliver a <strong>relacion</strong>, an introductory poem&mdash;usually a narrative that contains a moral lesson or a humorous story that has no connection to the main topic. After this, the hari delivers a <strong>hatol</strong> (judgment) and orders the execution of the penalty using the palmatorya. But the judgment is usually not carried out, as another participant will stand up and defend the accused. This commences a series of <strong>pagpapatama</strong> (allegation) and <strong>pagtatanggol</strong> (defense) by the duplero. Any guest who wishes to participate in the duplo but is not in the initial lineup is then permitted to enter the <strong>circulo</strong> (circle) by performing a <strong>panawagan</strong> (plea). Here, the new participant creates a fictive situation that will allow him or her to enter the circulo. In his account, possibly of a 19th-century duplo, Balmaseda noted that a duplo performance may extend to as long as 24 hours, as participants may enter and exit the circulo. He called it the &ldquo;marathon sa tulaan&rdquo; (marathon of poetry).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gener used laro and <strong>paligsahan sa katwiran</strong> (contest of reason) to describe this form. The duplo may use the same situation to launch the game but also tackle various topics as it progresses. It may use <strong>katwiran</strong> (reason or argument) derived from different sources, such as riddles, proverbs, myths and legends, awit and&nbsp;<em>korido</em>, folktales, fables, history, current events, news, the Bible, lives of the saints, the pasyon, and even the Penal and Civil Code. In his account, Jose mentioned the term <strong>binayabas</strong> to refer to very common topics or arguments used by novices and <strong>tinigpas</strong> to refer to abrupt shifting of topics resorted to by the untrained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish chronicler Tomas Ortiz, in his account, noted that in the 18th century, the Spanish church authorities prohibited gatherings by the people and the performance of folk rituals, such as the duplo. Instead, they ordered the people to pray for the dead inside the church to avoid &ldquo;errors&rdquo; in commemorating the death. Ortiz further noted that when the people were confronted for violating the order, they would reason out that the purpose of their gathering was to offer a holy rosary for the deceased. Since the practice of the duplo survived over the next centuries, it was obvious that the Spanish authorities failed to fully implement the order and prevent the people from observing the rituals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zafra noted that the Filipinos&rsquo; insistence on mounting the duplo despite the prohibition of the Spanish religious authorities is actually a performance of the very essence of the duplo&mdash;the primacy of the katwiran (reason) over&nbsp;<em>kapangyarihan&nbsp;</em>(power). In the playing of the duplo, the dictum &ldquo;ang utos ng hari/hindi mababali&rdquo; (the king&rsquo;s order/cannot be violated), set by the king, has to be transgressed since the exchange of katwiran can only happen when the king&rsquo;s order of executing the punishment is ignored. The duplero&rsquo;s disobedience of the hari&rsquo;s order so that they can proceed with their argumentation may be seen as a parallel to the Filipinos&rsquo; assertion of the performance of their folk rituals, despite the prohibition of the authorities (2000, 158-59).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5250\">Marcelo H. del Pilar</a>, acknowledged as one of the best duplero during his time (Gatmaitan 1965, 13-14), utilized the form in his poem &ldquo;Dupluhan&rdquo; (ca. 1887) to launch his attacks against the Spanish authorities. The poem, which comprises 13 stanzas of dedecasyllabic lines, can be divided into two; each part is determined by the character that the belyako is addressing. In the first part, a belyako speaks to a belyaka, the Tinubuang Lupa (Motherland), who was sentenced by the Hari or Monarka (Monarch). The belyako defends the belyaka but fails to have the sentence lifted. In the succeeding stanzas, the emotional basis of the belyako&rsquo;s defense is laid out&mdash;the Bayan&rsquo;s concern and care since his childhood. In the second part, the belyako turns upon the Hari, who is described as &ldquo;<em>sakdal bangis</em>&rdquo; (most fierce) and addresses him in lines full of irony that are both bitter and threatening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A play using the duplo form was staged by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a> in Jan 1976 at the Dulaang Rajah Sulayman in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/303\">Fort Santiago</a>. Titled <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/541\"><strong>Dupluhang Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (National Joust/People&rsquo;s Joust), the play was written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5435\">Domingo Landicho</a> and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo Labad</a>. It was later restaged by Teatro <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3331\">Umalohokan</a> in 1978 in Laguna under the direction of Rey Pimentel and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3256\">Louie Sevilla</a> (Landicho 1991, ix).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <strong><em>Dupluhang Bayan</em></strong>, Manggagawa (Workers) and Magsasaka (Peasants) take the roles of the belyako and belyaka. The Tagapagsalita (Speaker) presents the usual opening situation of the duplo&mdash;the loss of the king&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>kulasisi&nbsp;</em>(bird). After this, Manggagawa and Magsasaka begin their duel. The arguments, however, do not discuss who is responsible for the loss of the kulasisi, but the contribution of the workers and peasants in society. Interspersed in the duplo are dramatized&nbsp;<em>alamat&nbsp;</em>(legends). These stories become starting points for exploring discourses about service, slavery, colonialism, and power.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Galileo S.

After the rites of Maundy Thursday in the early evening, the priest, accompanied by the 12 apostles whose feet he had washed earlier, walks to the house of the <strong>hermana</strong> (female sponsor), where local food&mdash;usually fish, vegetables, and rice&mdash;has been laid out on a long table, or to the parish priest&rsquo;s <strong>convento</strong>, where they partake of a lamb-shaped loaf of bread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Gasan, Marinduque, in 1987, after the rites of Maundy Thursday, the apostles went to the hermana&rsquo;s house, seated themselves on two sides of a long table, and listened as the priest at the head of the table spoke on the significance of the Last Supper. The priest explained that the paschal supper was originally observed by the Jews in thanksgiving for their delivery from Egypt; that it centered on the lamb, whose blood had originally been smeared on Hebrew doors to protect the firstborn of Israel from the Angel of Death; and that this lamb in turn had become the symbol of Christ, who gave up his life so that every human being&rsquo;s sins may be forgiven. After the homily, the priest and the apostles partook of the supper as a group of women chanted the verses from the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g&nbsp;<strong>Genesis</strong></em></strong></a>, narrating the events of the Last Supper. The rest of the guests helped themselves to the feast.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In Baao, Camarines Sur, in 1988, the priest and the apostles ate their supper quietly in a room in the hermana&rsquo;s house, while candles burned in front of a picture of the Last Supper at one end of the table. In Loon, Bohol, before the earthquake of 2013, the 12 apostles sat 6 and 6 on either side of the parish priest (who represented Christ), on one side of a long table facing the faithful (evoking da Vinci&rsquo;s masterpiece), with their backs to the altar. After the meatless supper, the last mass for Holy Week was celebrated in the evening of Holy Thursday (Cordero-Fernando and Zialcita 2000, 123-25).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Morong, Rizal, the custom of the <strong>cordero</strong> is practiced every Holy Thursday. The <strong>hermanos mayores</strong> (principal sponsors), usually a couple chosen by the Parish Council a year or so before, lead a procession of family members, friends, neighbors, and devotees all dressed up in formal attire, from their house to the Morong church. The highlight of the procession is the cordero that the couple carry&mdash;the figure of a white lamb, representing Jesus Christ (&ldquo;the Lamb of God&rdquo;) reposing on a tray or huge bible, with the pole of a little flag depicting a cross tucked under one of its legs. The lamb is made of mashed potatoes and sweet potato. At the church altar, the cordero is blessed by the priest as 12 male parishioners clad in apostles&rsquo; costumes look on. After the blessing, the cordero is then cut up, and its many parts distributed to the apostles and devotees in attendance. The hermanos then lead the procession back to the house, carrying with them the head of the cordero, which they will present later to the next hermanos to symbolize the turnover of responsibility for the cordero to the latter.

After the rites of Maundy Thursday in the early evening, the priest, accompanied by the 12 apostles whose feet he had washed earlier, walks to the house of the <strong>hermana</strong> (female sponsor), where local food&#x2014;usually fish, vegetables, and rice&#x2014;has been laid out on a long table, or to the parish priest&#x2019;s <strong>convento</strong>, where they partake of a lamb-shaped loaf of bread."

The priest explained that the paschal supper was originally observed by the Jews in thanksgiving for their delivery from Egypt; that it centered on the lamb, whose blood had originally been smeared on Hebrew doors to protect the firstborn of Israel from the Angel of Death; and that this lamb in turn had become the symbol of Christ, who gave up his life so that every human being&#x2019;s sins may be forgiven. After the homily, the priest and the apostles partook of the supper as a group of women chanted the verses from the <a href=\"/9/78/1927\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g&#xA0;<strong>Genesis</strong></em></strong></a>, narrating the events of the Last Supper. The rest of the guests helped themselves to the feast."

The lamb is made of mashed potatoes and sweet potato. At the church altar, the cordero is blessed by the priest as 12 male parishioners clad in apostles&#x2019; costumes look on. After the blessing, the cordero is then cut up, and its many parts distributed to the apostles and devotees in attendance. The hermanos then lead the procession back to the house, carrying with them the head of the cordero, which they will present later to the next hermanos to symbolize the turnover of responsibility for the cordero to the latter.

This ancient and popular play is called &ldquo;komedya&rdquo; in most Christianized parts of the country, but is also known locally as <strong>kuleleng</strong> in Isabela; <strong>bakal-bakal</strong> in Pangasinan; <strong>cumidya</strong> in Pampanga; <strong>kolokyo</strong> in Catanduanes; <strong>moro-moro</strong>, <strong>linambay</strong>,and <strong>minoros</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>-speaking provinces; and <strong>hadi-hadi</strong> in Leyte. Among the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, the komedya on the search for the Holy Cross is called <strong>tibag</strong>, <strong>arakyo</strong>, <strong>kolokyo</strong>,and <strong>elena</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The local komedya is derived from the Spanish <strong>comedia</strong> (meaning, play), which was introduced into the Philippines by Spain in the 16th century. The first comedia in Latin was presented in Cebu in 1598. Since then, many types of local komedya have been staged: those depicting actual events, like the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/551\"><strong><em>Gran Comedia dela Toma del Pueblo de Corralat y Conquista del Cerro</em></strong></a> (Grand Play on the Capture of the Town of Corralat and the Conquest of the Hill), 1637, which dramatized the defeat of the Maguindanao chieftain Kudarat at the hands of Sebastian Hurtado de Corcuera; those narrating the lives of saints, like the <strong><em>Martirio de Santa Barbara</em></strong> (Martyrdom of Saint Barbara), 1609, performed in Bohol in the native language; and those about the loves and conflicts of royal personages in the kingdoms of Europe, Turkey, Persia, and Arabia, like the <strong><em>Vida de Atamante</em></strong> (Life of Atamante), circa 1887.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The komedya about real events in the Philippines did not prosper, although <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a> created komedya in the 19th century, which were based on actual events in other countries, such as <strong><em>Mahomet at Constanza</em></strong>, ca. 1828, which is about the rebellion of the Greeks aganst the Turks in the 1820s. The religious komedya, on the other hand, yielded more examples, perhaps because many of these were performed during the feasts of patron saints, which were celebrated with masses, processions, and, often, performances on stage or on the streets. Some of the religious komedya that survived to the 20th century are the <strong><em>Haybing</em></strong> of Taal, Batangas, a komedya on the miracles wrought by the Virgin of Caysasay on a Chinaman, and the <strong><em>Comedia de San Miguel</em></strong> (Play of San Miguel) of Iligan City, a verse play narrating Lusbel&rsquo;s rebellion against God and his punishment at the hands of Archangel San Miguel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of the three types of local komedya, the third became the most popular. With stories drawn from the European metrical romances that were orally transmitted or published in&nbsp;<em>cuarto</em>-sized <strong>libritos</strong> (booklets),these komedya usually focused on stories about Carlomagno and the Doce Pares de Francia or Twelve Peers of France (e.g., Rolando and Baldovino), the Siete Infantes de Lara or Seven Sons of Lara, Gonzalo de Cordova, Rodrigo de Villa, Atamante and Minople, and Alejandre and Luis. Later, poets like <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5228\">Jose dela Cruz</a> (1746-1829) and his student Francisco Baltazar (1788-1863) developed original stories for their komedya, even as they elevated the verses of the komedya to <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> and deepened the characterization of the usual stereotypes. Their outstanding plays include de la Cruz&rsquo;s <strong><em>El Amor y la Envidia</em></strong> (Love and Jealousy) and <strong><em>Los Traidores de la Patria</em></strong> (Traitors of the Country) and Baltazar&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong></a> (Orosman and Zafira) and <strong><em>Mahomet at Constanza</em></strong> (Mahomet and Constance). Foreign films (e.g., <strong><em>The Mark of Zorro</em></strong>,1920; <strong><em>The Bridge of Sighs</em></strong>, 1936)as well as popular magazines and folklore have inspired contemporary komedya. Whatever the sources, the <strong>orihinal</strong> or script of the komedya follows a strictly chronological sequence of events, and casts all dialogue in verse, most common of which are the <strong>plosa</strong> (dodecasyllabic quatrain) and the <strong>romanse</strong> (octosyllabic quatrain). In the past, long traditional komedya performances were preceded by the declamation of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>loa</strong></a>,a long poem usually in praise of the patron saint, and featured dances or skits called <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/473\"><strong>sainete</strong></a> or <strong>entremes</strong> before or between komedya acts or scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The characters of the komedya, who belong to Christian kingdoms like Espa&ntilde;a, Portugal, Alemania, Italia, Dinamarca, Albania, and Francia, would include the <strong>rey</strong> (king), <strong>reina</strong> (queen), <strong>princesa</strong> (princess), <strong>principe</strong> (prince), <strong>consejero</strong> (counsellor), <strong>general</strong> (general), and <strong>soldado</strong> (soldier); while those who belong to the Moro kingdoms of Persia, Turquia, and Arabia would include the <strong>sultan</strong>, <strong>visir</strong>, <strong>emir</strong>, or <strong>emperadora/emperatriz</strong>, general,and soldado. Each kingdom also has a very important character&mdash;that is, the pusongor <strong>locayo</strong>,the court jester who makes audiences laugh. <strong>Villanos</strong> (villagers), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> (shepherds), and <strong>gigantes</strong> (giants) complete the cast of a typical komedya. In general, characterization in the komedya is one-dimensional&mdash;namely, Christians are always good and Moros are invariably bad. Both are supposed to be fierce in battle, but uncouthness, braggadocio, lust, treachery, and greed are more pronounced among the Moros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Spanish times, the komedya has been presented in towns as part of the town fiesta in honor of the local patron saint, with support from <strong>hermanos</strong> (male sponsors) and the townspeople, who together spend for the stage, sets, props, lighting, costumes, food for rehearsals and performances, the brass band, and other incidental expenses. When presented commercially in closed <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>teatros</strong></a> (theaters) as in Manila in the 19th century, impresarios/producers sold tickets to cover production cost and their profit. With their convoluted plots, long <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>marcha</strong></a> (marches), <strong>batalla</strong> (choreographed fighting), and <strong>dicho</strong> (stylized declamation of lines), one komedya usually took three nights (with performances from about 8:00 pm to midnight) or two days and nights to perform. Sometimes, one komedya could take as many as nine nights to complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most komedya would have a rectangular stage about five feet above the ground, divided by a makeshift wall into the acting area (up front) and the dressing area (at the back). This wall would usually have, on the first level, two passageways, one on stage right for exits and entrances of Christian kingdoms, and another on stage left for those of the Moro kingdoms. Sometimes there is also an opening in the middle of the two passageways representing a cave for the forest scenes. From the second level juts out a balcony from which the royal family watches the <strong>torneo</strong> (tournaments) called by the king in order to choose a husband for the princess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Definite props identify the various settings on this stage: a potted plant and chair on one corner would identify the <strong>hardin</strong> (garden) for love scenes; a <strong>trono</strong> (throne) at center stage under the balcony would denote the <strong>sala</strong> or royal hall where the king consults his generals in the <strong>consejo</strong> (council), dispenses justice, receives the <strong>embahada</strong> or embassy, and blesses marriages. To light the stage, torches, gas lamps, petromax, electric bulbs, spotlights, and dimmers have been used at different periods from the 19th century to the present. Today, microphones, hanging or standing or lapel, amplify the sounds of dialogue and background music. The overall <strong>direktor</strong> coordinates all the work of the assistants who design, construct, decorate, and take care of the <strong>entablado</strong> or stage; the bandmaster who oversees rehearsals and performances of the royal marcha (slow march), both <strong>cristiana</strong> (Christian) and <strong>mora</strong> (Muslim), the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>paso doble</strong></a> (fast double-step march), the <strong>batalla</strong> (lively fighting music), and the <strong>eskaramusa</strong> (waltz during the torneo), as well as the background music for sentimental scenes; the <strong>director de magia,</strong> who designs, installs, and manipulates the <strong>magia</strong> (magical effects) needed by a play (e.g., swooping birds, lions and tigers, devouring whales, and giant roses). The direktor himself also coordinates with the sponsors about arrangements, chooses and rehearses the actors, and often doubles up as the <strong>apuntador/diktador</strong> (prompter), who feeds every line to the actors during performance from a little <strong>concha</strong> (shell) in front of the stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In most communities, the actors who join the komedya do so as part of the fulfillment of personal vows called <strong>panata</strong> to the patron saint for favors asked or granted in the past. The young men and women who are chosen for the play should have able bodies, loud voices, and good looks (the last especially if they are to come out as princes and princesses). Once chosen, these young men and women train for several months under the direktor who teaches them the techniques of doing the marcha, batalla, dicho, and <strong>mustra</strong> (gestures).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Costumes in the komedya are usually made of rich materials (velvet and satin are favorites) and decorated with embroidery, sequins, beads, plumes, and feathers. Even as the costumes are influenced by the latest fashions (especially for women), they still succeed in externalizing the play&rsquo;s ideological messages. Thus, Christians are dressed in black or dark colors (e.g., green, blue) while Moros are attired in red or orange. To underscore the hierarchy of authority, the king wears the longest cape and the only crown; the queen dons a tiara and cape; the prince, a small cape and a three-cornered hat called <strong>trespicos</strong>; the soldiers, tiny capes and small hats. Royal personages wear bands and sashes. All characters usually carry swords, daggers, and/or fans. True to its historical nature, the basic clothes (pants, shirts, dresses, shoes) in a komedya always follow the latest in contemporary fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many komedya continue to be performed today in the various islands of the archipelago, where the community support has not waned and modern education and mass media have not diminished the people&rsquo;s belief and delight in this drama form. Since many of these komedya depict stories from the Spanish colonial period, they continue to communicate messages that may be authoritarian or anti-Muslim (and therefore divisive) or colonial (Europeans always win and the European-looking are idolized). For these negative messages, the traditional komedya have time and again been attacked, especially by the likes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, who at the turn of the century stated that this &ldquo;benighted&rdquo; form of drama should already be replaced by a more realistic play like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not enough komedya with positive messages have been written, but notable among these modern komedya are <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/646\"><strong><em>Prinsipe Rodante</em></strong></a> (Prince Rodante), 1962, by Max Allanigue, where the villain is a Christian prince who is unjust; and <strong><em><strong>Florante</strong> at Laura</em></strong> (Florante and Laura), 1992, a stage adaptation of the Baltazar awit, which was reinterpreted and directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3251\">Jonas Sebastian</a>, with design by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2790\">Salvador Bernal</a> and choreography by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/51/2473\">Nonoy Froilan</a>, for the children of Dongalo Elementary School in Para&ntilde;aque.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a concerted effort to raise this folk drama into an art form, by creating artistic and substantial komedya scripts with progressive messages, and upgrading the production aspects of the komedya. The landmark production that may establish the komedya as an important form of the national theater is the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> production of Francisco Baltazar&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></em></strong>,1993, directed by Jonas Sebastian, which retains and refines the characteristic marches, choreographed batalla, verse declamation, costumes and sets of the komedya as performed in San Dionisio, Para&ntilde;aque, and Pe&ntilde;aranda, Nueva Ecija. A later contemporary and more innovative version of the komedya, staged in the University of the Philippines (UP) in 2008, reinterpreted the conflict between the three kingdoms in neo-ethnic music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2785\">Carol Bello</a> and original choreography by the director himself, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3245\">Dexter Santos</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the goal of reviving and preserving the komedya, Dean <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5033\">Virgilio S. Almario</a> spearheaded the Komedya Fiesta: First National Festival, a monthlong tribute to the komedya hosted by the College of Arts and Letters, UP Diliman, in Feb 2008. The Komedya Fiesta opened with <strong>tahak</strong> (explore), a grand parade around the university oval with three stations representing the three most important scenes in a komedya: the <strong>kaharian</strong> (kingdom), hardin (garden), and <strong>kagubatan</strong> (woods/forests). The parade was also scored with scenes and excerpts from komedya productions from various theater groups. The <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3028\">Komedya ng San Dionisio</a> from Para&ntilde;aque performed Max Allanigue&rsquo;s <strong><em>Principe Rodante</em></strong>.The all-male cast of Komedya ng San Miguel from Lanao del Norte staged <strong><em>Kinabuhi ni Senyor San Miguel</em></strong> (Life of Se&ntilde;or San Miguel), a play considered as sacred practice in which roles are handed down from generation to generation. Hailing from Antique, the Hiraya Theater Company presented Exaltacion V. Combong&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kasanag Batok sa Sugal</em></strong> (Light vs Gambling). The <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3026\">Komedya ng Don Galo</a>, a komedya troupe of child performers, staged their own rendition of <strong><em>Principe Rodante</em></strong> <em>.</em>From Baler, the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2847\">Comedia de Baler</a> closed the performances with <strong><em>Sakim na Pagmamahal</em></strong> (Selfish Love).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Komedya Fiesta also helda conference on the komedya, which gathered komedya practitioners and Philippine theater scholars, whose selected papers were later published in one volume of the <strong><em>Philippine Humanities Review</em></strong>. The festival also featured a workshop that focused on the different elements of a komedya production.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

The religious komedya, on the other hand, yielded more examples, perhaps because many of these were performed during the feasts of patron saints, which were celebrated with masses, processions, and, often, performances on stage or on the streets. Some of the religious komedya that survived to the 20th century are the <strong><em>Haybing</em></strong> of Taal, Batangas, a komedya on the miracles wrought by the Virgin of Caysasay on a Chinaman, and the <strong><em>Comedia de San Miguel</em></strong> (Play of San Miguel) of Iligan City, a verse play narrating Lusbel&#x2019;s rebellion against God and his punishment at the hands of Archangel San Miguel."

				"value": "Of the three types of local komedya, the third became the most popular. With stories drawn from the European metrical romances that were orally transmitted or published in&#xA0;<em>cuarto</em>-sized <strong>libritos</strong> (booklets),these komedya usually focused on stories about Carlomagno and the Doce Pares de Francia or Twelve Peers of France (e.g., Rolando and Baldovino), the Siete Infantes de Lara or Seven Sons of Lara, Gonzalo de Cordova, Rodrigo de Villa, Atamante and Minople, and Alejandre and Luis. Later, poets like <a href=\"/9/9/5228\">Jose dela Cruz</a> (1746-1829) and his student Francisco Baltazar (1788-1863) developed original stories for their komedya, even as they elevated the verses of the komedya to <a href=\"/9/73/1559\">poetry</a> and deepened the characterization of the usual stereotypes. Their outstanding plays include de la Cruz&#x2019;s <strong><em>El Amor y la Envidia</em></strong> (Love and Jealousy) and <strong><em>Los Traidores de la Patria</em></strong> (Traitors of the Country) and Baltazar&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/629\"><strong><em>Orosman at Zafira</em></strong></a> (Orosman and Zafira) and <strong><em>Mahomet at Constanza</em></strong> (Mahomet and Constance). Foreign films (e.g., <strong><em>The Mark of Zorro</em></strong>,1920; <strong><em>The Bridge of Sighs</em></strong>, 1936)as well as popular magazines and folklore have inspired contemporary komedya. Whatever the sources, the <strong>orihinal</strong> or script of the komedya follows a strictly chronological sequence of events, and casts all dialogue in verse, most common of which are the <strong>plosa</strong> (dodecasyllabic quatrain) and the <strong>romanse</strong> (octosyllabic quatrain). In the past, long traditional komedya performances were preceded by the declamation of the <a href=\"/7/55/457\"><strong>loa</strong></a>,a long poem usually in praise of the patron saint, and featured dances or skits called <a href=\"/7/55/473\"><strong>sainete</strong></a> or <strong>entremes</strong> before or between komedya acts or scenes."

In general, characterization in the komedya is one-dimensional&#x2014;namely, Christians are always good and Moros are invariably bad.

When presented commercially in closed <a href=\"/2/5/247\"><strong>teatros</strong></a> (theaters) as in Manila in the 19th century, impresarios/producers sold tickets to cover production cost and their profit. With their convoluted plots, long <a href=\"/5/35/784\"><strong>marcha</strong></a> (marches), <strong>batalla</strong> (choreographed fighting), and <strong>dicho</strong> (stylized declamation of lines), one komedya usually took three nights (with performances from about 8:00 pm to midnight) or two days and nights to perform.

To light the stage, torches, gas lamps, petromax, electric bulbs, spotlights, and dimmers have been used at different periods from the 19th century to the present.

The direktor himself also coordinates with the sponsors about arrangements, chooses and rehearses the actors, and often doubles up as the <strong>apuntador/diktador</strong> (prompter), who feeds every line to the actors during performance from a little <strong>concha</strong> (shell) in front of the stage."

Thus, Christians are dressed in black or dark colors (e.g., green, blue) while Moros are attired in red or orange. To underscore the hierarchy of authority, the king wears the longest cape and the only crown; the queen dons a tiara and cape; the prince, a small cape and a three-cornered hat called <strong>trespicos</strong>; the soldiers, tiny capes and small hats. Royal personages wear bands and sashes. All characters usually carry swords, daggers, and/or fans.

For these negative messages, the traditional komedya have time and again been attacked, especially by the likes of <a href=\"/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, who at the turn of the century stated that this &#x201C;benighted&#x201D; form of drama should already be replaced by a more realistic play like the <a href=\"/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>."

		"text": "<p>The <strong>loa</strong>, from Spanish&nbsp;<em>loar&nbsp;</em>or &ldquo;to praise,&rdquo; may be a long poem or a short dramatic piece originally meant to be performed on stage to extoll a visiting dignitary, the patron saint whose feast is being celebrated, the sponsors of a performance, or the people of the town where a performance is to be held. The loa may be performed by itself or as an introduction to a long <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> or <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>. The <strong>lowa</strong>, in some Visayan towns, is recited in small gatherings, such as in a funeral wake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More often than not, the loa uses rhetorical and flowery verses arranged in quatrains. The <strong>plosa</strong> or dodecasyllabic quatrain is the usual measure of the loa, with a single assonantal rhyme scheme. The rhyme scheme may change with each new stanza. Public declamation of the loa by a young man or woman, called <strong>loante</strong>, tends to be in a singsong manner because the 12-syllable line has a <strong>caesura</strong> or pause in the middle.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the earliest recorded loa were drama. In 1708, Fr Gaspar de San Agustin wrote a loa to introduce the Spanish <strong>comedia&nbsp;<em>Amor Es Mas Laberinto</em></strong> (Love Is Such a Labyrinth). The loa opens with a nymph representing Espa&ntilde;a or Spain, asleep. Slowly Yris or Rainbow, displaying all her colors as in a fan, descends through stage machinery. After describing where she comes from, she awakens Espa&ntilde;a, who then delivers a long passage that ends with her summoning Regocijo or Joy. Regocijo and Espa&ntilde;a exchange verses. At the end, Regocijo introduces the comedia, which is the main feature of the performance to honor the newly born Prince Don Luis Fernando.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1729, on the occasion of the canonization of two Jesuit saints, San Estanislao de Kostka and San Luis Gonzaga, Fr Murillo Velarde wrote a short loa titled &ldquo;No Hay Competicion en el Cielo&rdquo; (There Is No Competition in Heaven). Three characters&mdash;Astrea, Italia, and Polonia&mdash;give their speeches, with six violins and six cellos providing the music in between. Italia delivers the panegyric to San Luis and Polonia to her son, San Estanislao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Lipa, Batangas, around the 1800s, a loa was declaimed by a loante to honor the visiting official, General Alava. On stage a young man in horse-riding attire pretended to be asleep on a chair. Three times his sleep was interrupted by sad songs being sung behind the curtain. Finally, he woke up saying that a voice had informed him that the visitor he waited for had arrived. He then launched into a long loa, which combined high-flown eulogy with comedy. He narrated all the naval expeditions of the admiral and all the honors and titles that had been conferred on him by the King of Spain. The poem was spiced up with allusions to Ulysses, Aristotle, and Plato, who figure in situations that are wildly apocryphal&mdash;for example, to measure its depth, Aristotle was supposed to have hurled himself into the sea, where he finally perished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, however, the loa is a straight lyric poem with snatches of narrative, as exemplified by two loas written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a> in the mid-19th century, both commissioned by committees in charge of festivities. The first loa is an apostrophe to San Miguel, patron saint of Udyong, Bataan, narrating how God sent the archangel to crush the rebellion of proud Lucifer. The second loa takes note of the joyous festivities that are undertaken to celebrate the accession to the Spanish throne of Isabela II de Borbon. The poem is a tribute to the queen who is seen as the harbinger of peace to the Spanish nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same lyric loa are performed in Dapitan, Zamboanga, on 24 Jul, the feast of the patron saint Santiago Matamoros. The image of Santiago astride a horse is taken in procession around the town to a chapel where a young man declaims a loa in praise of the saint (Tiongson 1992, 16-19). Likewise in Gasan, Marinduque, the loa is performed by a young lady in&nbsp;<em>terno&nbsp;</em>or long gown during the Easter Sunday <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> of the Aglipayans. In front of the image of the Virgin Mary whose black veil of mourning has just been removed by an angel, she tells the Virgin to rejoice because her son has risen from the dead, as He had foretold, and then asks her to pray so that the freedom of the country may also be resurrected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loa is still observed as a major tradition in Batangas to our day, in towns like Santa Teresita, Alitagtag, Lemery, San Luis, San Nicolas, Agoncillo, Calaca, Balayan, and Taal. In Taal, the loa, here called <strong>luwa</strong>, is performed to honor the town&rsquo;s patron saints on their respective feast days: San Martin de Tours, a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity and became a defender and propagator of the faith, on 11 Nov; and the Virgin of Caysasay, a small wooden image of the Virgin Mary in her attribute as the Immaculate Conception, on 8 Dec. According to Gloria Tamayo (2008), for each feast day, five to eight luwa are delivered by <strong>luwante</strong>, who may be male or female, and of any age but usually teenagers. The luwante, who are chosen by the <strong>hermana mayor</strong> (principal sponsor) of the year, usually perform the luwa as a <strong>panata</strong> (vow), either to give thanks for favors received or to continue a family tradition or to ask for help in a new endeavor. Once chosen, the luwante chooses the poem he will declaim, which may be old or newly requested from a local poet. The poem, in dodecasyllabic quatrains, is usually made up of a <strong>papuri</strong>,or lines praising the patron on its feast day; a <strong>pasasalamat</strong>, where the luwante thanks the patron saint for favors he has showered on Taal and its people; and a <strong>panalangin</strong>, where the luwante asks the saint to protect Taal and give it more blessings. On the day of the fiesta, the luwante, dressed in either barong or terno, delivers the luwa on a six-foot high platform decorated with fronds and flowers built right in front of his/her family house. The luwa is declaimed with proper intonation and gestures in front of the image of the patron saint, when its flower-bedecked <strong>karo</strong> or float stops in front of the luwante&rsquo;s house. After the luwa, the procession moves on and makes similar stops at all the houses where other luwa are to be declaimed. Tamayo believes that the luwa tradition continues because it expresses Taal&rsquo;s identity and ensures the protection of the town from calamities like the eruption of Taal volcano, storms, floods, and locusts, simultaneously strengthening Catholicism and introducing and integrating the youth of the town to their community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while the long religious loa of the establishment tends to be formal, high-flown, and grave, the short lowaof the Visayan folk is casual, earthy, and irreverent. According to Puedan (1988, 204-5), the lowa of Antique is a single quatrain recited as &ldquo;punishment&rdquo; in parlor games held during the <strong>bilasyon</strong> (wake). Usually performed by a circle of male and female teenagers, the game could be the <strong>bordon</strong>, where participants pass a ring around from person to person as they sing the same quatrain. When the singing ends, the &ldquo;thief&rdquo; at center must guess who is holding the ring. If he guesses right, the participant with the ring must recite a lowa as punishment for being caught with the ring. Sometimes the game is the <strong>kabatingan</strong>, where a coco shell container is passed on from forearm to forearm without using one&rsquo;s hands.

The <strong>plosa</strong> or dodecasyllabic quatrain is the usual measure of the loa, with a single assonantal rhyme scheme. The rhyme scheme may change with each new stanza. Public declamation of the loa by a young man or woman, called <strong>loante</strong>, tends to be in a singsong manner because the 12-syllable line has a <strong>caesura</strong> or pause in the middle."

In 1708, Fr Gaspar de San Agustin wrote a loa to introduce the Spanish <strong>comedia&#xA0;<em>Amor Es Mas Laberinto</em></strong> (Love Is Such a Labyrinth). The loa opens with a nymph representing Espa&#xF1;a or Spain, asleep. Slowly Yris or Rainbow, displaying all her colors as in a fan, descends through stage machinery. After describing where she comes from, she awakens Espa&#xF1;a, who then delivers a long passage that ends with her summoning Regocijo or Joy. Regocijo and Espa&#xF1;a exchange verses. At the end, Regocijo introduces the comedia, which is the main feature of the performance to honor the newly born Prince Don Luis Fernando."

On stage a young man in horse-riding attire pretended to be asleep on a chair. Three times his sleep was interrupted by sad songs being sung behind the curtain. Finally, he woke up saying that a voice had informed him that the visitor he waited for had arrived. He then launched into a long loa, which combined high-flown eulogy with comedy. He narrated all the naval expeditions of the admiral and all the honors and titles that had been conferred on him by the King of Spain. The poem was spiced up with allusions to Ulysses, Aristotle, and Plato, who figure in situations that are wildly apocryphal&#x2014;for example, to measure its depth, Aristotle was supposed to have hurled himself into the sea, where he finally perished."

The first loa is an apostrophe to San Miguel, patron saint of Udyong, Bataan, narrating how God sent the archangel to crush the rebellion of proud Lucifer. The second loa takes note of the joyous festivities that are undertaken to celebrate the accession to the Spanish throne of Isabela II de Borbon. The poem is a tribute to the queen who is seen as the harbinger of peace to the Spanish nation."

The image of Santiago astride a horse is taken in procession around the town to a chapel where a young man declaims a loa in praise of the saint (Tiongson 1992, 16-19). Likewise in Gasan, Marinduque, the loa is performed by a young lady in&#xA0;<em>terno&#xA0;</em>or long gown during the Easter Sunday <a href=\"/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> of the Aglipayans. In front of the image of the Virgin Mary whose black veil of mourning has just been removed by an angel, she tells the Virgin to rejoice because her son has risen from the dead, as He had foretold, and then asks her to pray so that the freedom of the country may also be resurrected."

				"value": "The loa is still observed as a major tradition in Batangas to our day, in towns like Santa Teresita, Alitagtag, Lemery, San Luis, San Nicolas, Agoncillo, Calaca, Balayan, and Taal. In Taal, the loa, here called <strong>luwa</strong>, is performed to honor the town&#x2019;s patron saints on their respective feast days: San Martin de Tours, a Roman soldier who converted to Christianity and became a defender and propagator of the faith, on 11 Nov; and the Virgin of Caysasay, a small wooden image of the Virgin Mary in her attribute as the Immaculate Conception, on 8 Dec. According to Gloria Tamayo (2008), for each feast day, five to eight luwa are delivered by <strong>luwante</strong>, who may be male or female, and of any age but usually teenagers. The luwante, who are chosen by the <strong>hermana mayor</strong> (principal sponsor) of the year, usually perform the luwa as a <strong>panata</strong> (vow), either to give thanks for favors received or to continue a family tradition or to ask for help in a new endeavor. Once chosen, the luwante chooses the poem he will declaim, which may be old or newly requested from a local poet. The poem, in dodecasyllabic quatrains, is usually made up of a <strong>papuri</strong>,or lines praising the patron on its feast day; a <strong>pasasalamat</strong>, where the luwante thanks the patron saint for favors he has showered on Taal and its people; and a <strong>panalangin</strong>, where the luwante asks the saint to protect Taal and give it more blessings. On the day of the fiesta, the luwante, dressed in either barong or terno, delivers the luwa on a six-foot high platform decorated with fronds and flowers built right in front of his/her family house. The luwa is declaimed with proper intonation and gestures in front of the image of the patron saint, when its flower-bedecked <strong>karo</strong> or float stops in front of the luwante&#x2019;s house. After the luwa, the procession moves on and makes similar stops at all the houses where other luwa are to be declaimed. Tamayo believes that the luwa tradition continues because it expresses Taal&#x2019;s identity and ensures the protection of the town from calamities like the eruption of Taal volcano, storms, floods, and locusts, simultaneously strengthening Catholicism and introducing and integrating the youth of the town to their community."

According to Puedan (1988, 204-5), the lowa of Antique is a single quatrain recited as &#x201C;punishment&#x201D; in parlor games held during the <strong>bilasyon</strong> (wake). Usually performed by a circle of male and female teenagers, the game could be the <strong>bordon</strong>, where participants pass a ring around from person to person as they sing the same quatrain. When the singing ends, the &#x201C;thief&#x201D; at center must guess who is holding the ring. If he guesses right, the participant with the ring must recite a lowa as punishment for being caught with the ring.

Popular for centuries, this dance has many variations and names: <strong>palo-palo</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2353\">Ivatan</a>), <strong>sambali</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a>), <strong>moro-moro</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>), <strong>sayaw</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a>), <strong>bakahan</strong> (Tagalog), <strong>mardikas</strong> (Ternate&ntilde;o), <strong>sinulog</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>), and <strong>kinabayo</strong> (Cebuano in Dapitan).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dance is clearly related to the dance drama of the same name, which had roots in Spain in the 12th century and gained popularity in Mexico starting the 16th century, where it saw many variations&mdash;some with Santiago Matamoros or Carlomagno or the angels battling the Moors. The form may have been introduced into the Philippines sometime during the Spanish colonial period by priests or church people possibly brought by the galleons from Mexico sometime before 1815. Today, the moros y cristianos has become an important feature in many a town fiesta procession.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>This playlet is typified today by the <strong>sayaw</strong> of Ibajay, Aklan, whose text is said to have been written by Marianito Dalisay Calizo in the middle of the 19th century. Performed on the morning of the third Sunday of January, in honor of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o of Ibajay, this play begins with the warring factions grouped on opposite ends of a straight cemented street about half a kilometer long: the Bisaya (as Christians are called) in black coats, waist and breast bands, pants and pershing caps, in front of the church; and the Moros in red pants, vests, and headbands, in front of the&nbsp;<em>munisipyo&nbsp;</em>or town hall. The <strong>capitan</strong> of the Bisaya leads his men in praising the Santo Ni&ntilde;o, whose image is enthroned in front of the church. Meanwhile, on the other end of the long street, the sultan of the Moros decides to send two ambassadors to the Bisaya. The two <strong>embahadores</strong> (ambassadors) march to the Christian side and demand the image of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. The Bisaya refuse; the ambassadors return to their sultan at the other end of the street. The sultan now leads his army of Moros, brandishing swords and shields as they walk following an S-pattern on the straight road toward the Bisaya. In the middle of the road, Moro and Bisaya confront each other in two long lines, exchange threats, and fight to the music of a brass band. After this initial encounter, individual pairs of Moro and Bisaya engage each other and perform the sayaw, showing off their agility and skills in combat. In the end, the two armies confront each other once more until the Moros kneel in defeat and agree to be baptized. Forming a long line, pairs of Bisaya and Moro move toward the altar of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o in front of the church and cry &ldquo;Viva Se&ntilde;or Santo Ni&ntilde;o&rdquo; (Long Live the Lord Holy Child) in honor of the town&rsquo;s patron saint. The play, which takes about an hour, delights audiences of allages who usually follow the action on the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another version of the dance is the <strong>kinabayo</strong> &mdash;literally, &ldquo;using horses&rdquo;&mdash;a playlet performed in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte, on 24 Jul, the feast of San Jaime or Santiago. This short drama, which has no dialogue but only a narrative at the beginning, dramatizes the famous Battle of Covadonga, said to have occurred in 718 AD, where the Christian general Pelayo took a last stand against the Moro Alkamah, famous general of Alanos, then Emir of Spain. With the onslaught of Islam, the major cities of Spain had fallen under the crescent&mdash;Cordova, Toledo, Jaen, Sevilla, Salamanca, and Zaragosa, among others. Alkamah sends an emmissary to Pelayo to demand his surrender. Pelayo refuses and a battle ensues between the Cristianos and the Moros. The Christians are routed, but Pelayo falls on his knees and asks Santiago for help. Amidst thunder and lightning, Santiago &ldquo;comes down from the skies&rdquo; riding on a white horse, rallies the Christians behind him, and leads Pelayo&rsquo;s army to victory over the forces of Islam. With triumph ascertained, Santiago rides back into the skies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, the Battle of Covadonga was enacted on the streets, as part of the morning procession on the 24th of July. As revised in 1952, the kinabayo was presented on a bamboo stage in the church patio. A few years ago, the presentation was transferred to the Provincial High School grounds, where several groups&mdash;school- or barangay-based&mdash;competed with each other in interpreting the narration of the same scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A third version of this dance is the <strong>bakahan</strong> &mdash;literally, &ldquo;fighting&rdquo; in Tagalog. This unusual Lenten playlet, unique to San Antonio, Kalayaan, Laguna, dramatizes the swordfight between San Miguel Arcangel, representing the forces of good, and the <strong>hudyo</strong> or Jews, here equated with the forces of evil. From 2:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon of Good Friday (the hours when Christ is agonizing on the cross), the boy playing San Miguel, who wears a long-sleeved shirt, knee-length pants, a crown, cape, and shoes, and holds a long pole with flag in his left hand and a wooden sword in his right, stands in the middle of a circle of onlookers and hudyo, played by older boys attired in bands, capes, swords, and the most bizarre masks, and headdresses.

Performed on the morning of the third Sunday of January, in honor of the Santo Ni&#xF1;o of Ibajay, this play begins with the warring factions grouped on opposite ends of a straight cemented street about half a kilometer long: the Bisaya (as Christians are called) in black coats, waist and breast bands, pants and pershing caps, in front of the church; and the Moros in red pants, vests, and headbands, in front of the&#xA0;<em>munisipyo&#xA0;</em>or town hall. The <strong>capitan</strong> of the Bisaya leads his men in praising the Santo Ni&#xF1;o, whose image is enthroned in front of the church. Meanwhile, on the other end of the long street, the sultan of the Moros decides to send two ambassadors to the Bisaya. The two <strong>embahadores</strong> (ambassadors) march to the Christian side and demand the image of the Santo Ni&#xF1;o. The Bisaya refuse; the ambassadors return to their sultan at the other end of the street. The sultan now leads his army of Moros, brandishing swords and shields as they walk following an S-pattern on the straight road toward the Bisaya. In the middle of the road, Moro and Bisaya confront each other in two long lines, exchange threats, and fight to the music of a brass band. After this initial encounter, individual pairs of Moro and Bisaya engage each other and perform the sayaw, showing off their agility and skills in combat. In the end, the two armies confront each other once more until the Moros kneel in defeat and agree to be baptized. Forming a long line, pairs of Bisaya and Moro move toward the altar of the Santo Ni&#xF1;o in front of the church and cry &#x201C;Viva Se&#xF1;or Santo Ni&#xF1;o&#x201D; (Long Live the Lord Holy Child) in honor of the town&#x2019;s patron saint.

This short drama, which has no dialogue but only a narrative at the beginning, dramatizes the famous Battle of Covadonga, said to have occurred in 718 AD, where the Christian general Pelayo took a last stand against the Moro Alkamah, famous general of Alanos, then Emir of Spain. With the onslaught of Islam, the major cities of Spain had fallen under the crescent&#x2014;Cordova, Toledo, Jaen, Sevilla, Salamanca, and Zaragosa, among others. Alkamah sends an emmissary to Pelayo to demand his surrender. Pelayo refuses and a battle ensues between the Cristianos and the Moros. The Christians are routed, but Pelayo falls on his knees and asks Santiago for help. Amidst thunder and lightning, Santiago &#x201C;comes down from the skies&#x201D; riding on a white horse, rallies the Christians behind him, and leads Pelayo&#x2019;s army to victory over the forces of Islam.

		"text": "<div id=\"video_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Moryonan</strong> or <strong>moriones</strong> refers to the series of rituals and religious dramatization focusing on the story of the Roman soldier Longhino (Longinus) who was miraculously cured of blindness. It is highlighted by the <strong>pugutan</strong> or beheading of Longhino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Lenten season, in the towns of Boac, Mogpog, and Gasan in the island of Marinduque, men roam around the streets wearing colorful costumes and masks. Locally referred to as <strong>moryon</strong>, <strong>morion</strong>,or <strong>moriones</strong>, these men have made a vow to reenact the pugutan on Easter Sunday. Locals refer to this dramatization and series of rituals related to it as the Moriones festival or moryonan, a colorful mix of local faith and Catholicism. Based on the Biblical story, a drop of Christ&rsquo;s blood spurted into the eyes of the one-eyed Roman soldier Longhino, and cured him of his blindness, thereby turning him into a convert of Christ. The <strong>pagmomoryon</strong>, literally referring to the act of becoming a moryon, has been part of the people&rsquo;s devotion and expression of faith in God. The term <strong>moryon</strong> (English, &ldquo;morion&rdquo;) refers to a penitent, usually a man, who pledges to wear the moryon mask during Lent as a vow of faith to do penance similar to that of Christ&rsquo;s suffering. Local penitents regard the pagmomoryon as a pious vow and a gesture of appreciation for all the good graces bestowed upon their families or as a covenant with God so that their personal wishes may be granted (Adachi 1994; Goquingco 1980; Mandia 2002; Roces 1980).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Scholars have cited a number of sources for the termmoryon. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5653\">Alejandro Roces</a> (1980) proposes three possible sources. One is that it is a corruption of &ldquo;centurion,&rdquo; a captain of a hundred men in the Roman Army; the other is that it is derived from &ldquo;morion,&rdquo; the Spanish visorless high-crested helmet with toned-up edges used by the conquistadores; and the last is that it was named after Gov-Gen Domingo Moriones, who tried to soften the hard measures of the tobacco trust during his rule in 1877-80.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another explanation draws from the olden times when Marinduque was frequently attacked by foreign invaders whom the people referred to as<em>moro</em>. Stories popularized by the local elderly folk regarded the presence of the sea pirates as frightening, thus they would use this to scare children and discourage them from playing as expressed in &ldquo;<em>S&rsquo;yaka! May moryon! Hahabulin ka ng moryon</em>.&rdquo; (Beware! There&rsquo;s a morion! The morion will go after you.) &ldquo;<em>Moro yoon</em>&rdquo; (Those Moro) became moryon<em>.</em>Through time, the term was also used by the locals to refer to strangers or invaders. Another explanation takes note of the use of the word morion in souvenir programs that are mostly written in English, thus the term morion or moriones in its plural form.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>To become a morion, one has to take a vow. The vow is an act of atonement for sins committed in the past or a request for pardon or good graces. The longer one&rsquo;s vow, the more favorable rewards one may expect. Suffering becomes an index for the potency of a vow, as the locals believe that one expiates for an offense committed by carrying out the activities of a penitent, thereby regaining God&rsquo;s favor (Adachi 1994; Mandia 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting Holy Monday the morion walk around the streets, where they remain visible until Easter Sunday. Many believe that they descend from a sacred mountain or they may simply slip out of their houses, making sure that no one notices them. After performing ablutions in a stream, they go to a secret place where they wear their masks and costumes. At daybreak, they come down from the mountain with a sword lance or with a <strong>kalutang</strong> (wooden disc), more often by themselves or sometimes with a group. The morion remain silent as they walk to the town. Sometimes, they strike their kalutang in a distinct rhythm. Upon reaching the town, all they do is roam around the streets and walk all day long under the heat of the sun. Some perform dances or songs or play pranks on people or frighten children, making sure that their masks conceal their identities. Sometimes, the morion get invited for a snack or a drink or an invitation to sing or dance to a local tune. Amidst the intense heat or exhaustion, the morion must keep on walking around town as an expression of faith and gratitude for graces bestowed upon their families. As the sun sets, the morion make their way home to rest and prepare for the next day&rsquo;s bout.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The moryonan is made popular by the image of the morion mask and costume, which has come to be its mark of distinction. The costume resembles that of the Roman centurions, an outfit that the morion sews and creates personally, from the headgear to the sandals, and even the mask. The process of making the mask is supposed to be done in secret to protect the identity of the morion, or his vow will lose its impact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mask is composed of two parts&mdash;the <strong>maskara</strong> (mask) and the <strong>turbante</strong> (headgear). There are discernible decorative incisions in the beard and hairline, and the face is painted red or deep pink. The eyes are always large and the holes are burned through the pupil. The nose and mouth are always large and open. The mask often sports a deep frown, which is cut between the heavy brows, and the ears are large and flat. It commonly carries expressions of fierceness and/or stupidity. The turbante holds the mask in place and is firmly attached through a wire or string. It is often constructed from a light bamboo frame decorated with colored tinsel or antennae made of paper flowers, as has been traditionally seen in most headgears. The number of flowers attached to the headgear represents the number of years the morion has performed the vow. A sword or lance completes the outfit. Horsewhips and wooden staffs in the shape of a snake are also used by the older morion. More conservative morion use the kalutang. These masks and costumes are stored away secretly in a cave until the following year. To keep the impact of the vow and the secrecy of the morion&rsquo;s identity, he neither speaks or sings in a regular tone and only utters birdlike sounds when addressed. He covers his face with a handkerchief when he needs to take off his mask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dramatization of Longhino&rsquo;s beheading as the first Christian martyr in the pugutan is the highlight of the moryonan. The cast includes Longhino, the centurion captain; Pontius Pilate, the Roman official; Claudia Procula, the wife of Pilate; Caiaphas, the Jewish high priest; Annas, the wealthy Jewish priest; Herod, the King of Galilee; and the centurions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pugutan is usually done in the evening of Holy Saturday in Boac and on Easter Sunday in the towns of Mogpog and Gasan. It is said that the pugutan started in Mogpog and that the Boac pugutan took after that of the Mogpog pugutan while the Gasan version took after the Boac pugutan. However, each town has its own staged version of the pugutan. In Boac, it is performed alongside other festivities, such as beauty contests and folk dancing, with sound facilities and lighting systems supplied by supporters and politicians who regard the activity as an asset to the tourism industry. In Gasan, the number of morion has continuously decreased, such that young students in the secondary level are involved by their teachers who have been tasked to take charge of these festivities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Mogpog, the morion assemble in the town plaza at around 10:00 in the morning in a public square near the market area. A big stage is constructed and a big painting of Longhino being beheaded is set up behind it. The morion take time in playing pranks and scaring the children and the rest of the crowd while waiting for the pugutan to start. A festive program commences with a parade where morion from Boac and Gasan participate. Skits on local social concerns are presented, followed by an intermission of dancing and chanting. Soon after, smoke is spotted rising in the distance, signifying Christ&rsquo;s return, and Longhino rushes out of the stage proclaiming the glory of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Longhino struggles with other Roman soldiers who have been ordered to stop him. He then goes into hiding and the Roman soldiers are ordered to seize him, thus signaling the start of the <strong>habulan</strong> (chase). Longhino runs across open fields, river banks, the rice paddies, up and down coconut trees, and inside houses as trumpets blare and drums beat. Three times Longhino is captured and three times he escapes. Finally, an exhausted Longhino is captured and put to trial on the makeshift stage created in the public plaza. Pilate and his men try to convince Longhino to renounce his faith in Christ, but he refuses and is thus sentenced to death. Longhino is then taken by the <strong>berdugo</strong> (executioner) and brought to a platform, where the crowd pleads for his life. Longhino, during his last moments, delivers an impassioned speech where he recounts how the blood of Christ restored his sight. He then confirms his faith and accepts his fate. A bottle of red wine is poured over his neck as the fatal blow is delivered. The mask of Longhino is then held up to signify his death. A long moan of grief is heard as his body is carried around the town in a funeral procession.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the highlight of the moryonan is the pugutan,a whole series of folk and religious <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> performed during Lenten Season comprises the religious practice. Among these are the playing of kalutang, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a>,and <strong>antipo</strong> (Navida 2013; Mandia 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kalutang is a native musical instrument made up of two pieces of wood that are struck together to make a rhythm. Many of the older morion use the kalutang to complete their outfit. Others play the kalutang during the procession as their participation in the Lenten religious rites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The salubong is the meeting of the image of the Risen Christ and the Mater Dolorosa (Sorrowful Mother) during the early hours of Easter Sunday. It starts as two separate processions, one bearing the black-veiled Mater Dolorosa, and the other, the Resurrected Christ. The two separate processions meet at a chosen place where a child, dressed as an angel, is hoisted down as she sings songs of praise. She lifts the veil of mourning and reveals the white dress, indicating her joy for her son&rsquo;s resurrection. The two processions join and proceed to the church with much merrymaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sinakulo is the dramatization of the life and death of Christ, usually done on Holy Wednesday, Maundy Thursday, and sometimes on the morning of Good Friday, and after the midnight Mass of Easter Sunday. In many instances, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/483\"><strong>via crucis</strong></a>, or the reenactment of the sufferings of Christ as he carries his cross to Calvary, picks up where the sinakulo story ends. The morion participate in the sinakulo as Roman soldiers who take part in the via crucis (Way of the Cross) and the Crucifixion. In most towns, the sinakulo precedes the pugutan or the dramatization of the Longhino story (Navida 2013; Mandia 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The antipo in Marinduque is done on Good Friday as a gesture of gratitude for a cured illness or the atonement of a sinful past. It begins at noon and ends with the start of the afternoon procession. Theantipo is believed to be derived from the Latin word&nbsp;<em>antiphona&nbsp;</em>(antiphon), or the verses sung by priests before chanting the psalms. The frequency with which a morion participates in the antipo depends on his vow or <strong>panata</strong>. Some join the antipo every Holy Week, while others do so for the number of years that they have vowed to do. While participation in the antipo is not a requirement to be regarded as a true morion, one must have undergone the exercise at least once. Before Good Friday, the morion prepare the pieces of bamboo sticks that they will use to flagellate themselves. The number of sticks represent the number of years the morion penitent has vowed to participate in the antipo. At noon, the morion come together in the local cemetery to receive instructions from the leader called the <strong>magkakadlit</strong>. Prayers are said before a large cross that has been put up in the cemetery grounds. After this, the morion start whipping themselves in the upper and lower arms, chest, back, and other muscular parts until their muscles have become numb. Then, the magkakadlit makes incisions on the muscular parts of their bodies, using a sharp thin blade. The morion then whip these incisions until blood flows. Before the day ends, the morion join the procession, positioning themselves at the rear part behind the other morion. Here, the morion take part in the popular <strong>agawan</strong> (squabble) for the amulets or <strong>anting-anting</strong>, which include all adornments, candles, ropes, and images used in the procession. The possession of these objects is believed to bring good luck and good health as well as protection from danger or even death. During the procession, the morion lie facedown at the entrance of the church so that people can walk on them. This practice is considered to be another way of showing devotion to God and acquiring supernatural powers. A bath in the sea, which is believed to heal the mortal wounds acquired during the rites, completes the antipo for the morion (Adachi 1994; Mandia 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local scholars have noted how the traditional moryonan has evolved over time. Accounts indicate that the moryonan dates back to 1884, when the parish priest of San Isidoro in Mogpog, Fr Dionisio Santiago, introduced the idea that even a pagan like Longhino could offer his own life for Christ (Roces 1980; Semilla 1970; Mandia 2002). Local historians say that the first moryonan was held that year, with the first Longhino role being performed by a certain &ldquo;Tatang Bentong.&rdquo; At eight in the morning, he would wear his mask and roam around the town. After two hours, he would go back to the church and ring the church bells, and then he would roam around the streets and go back to the church at noon to do the same. Later, he included the Crucifixion in the moryonan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moryonan was traditionally done in open fields and riverbanks and performed by local penitents in their own way. The habulan (search for Longhino) would usually start in the morning and end at sunset. Longhino would usually engage the Roman &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; in a long chase across the fields, rivers, mountains, and seashore. The people would usually follow the scene of the chase, anywhere it went. As soon as the Roman soldiers caught Longhino, thepugutan would be done at the place where he was caught, oftentimes along the seashore. Back then, ordinary people improvised scenes from memory, with only their bodies and their faith as resources for the dramatization. The dramatization was lively, spontaneous, unstructured, and dependent on the improvisational skills of the penitents. After the pugutan, Longhino would proceed to share a bountiful dinner with his friends as a gesture of goodwill to the community (dela Paz 2014; Mandia 2002).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As tourists became attracted to the event, the need to make the story more intelligible to the outsiders became pronounced. Alejandro Roces, then secretary of the Department of Education, requested <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5162\">Celso Al. Carunungan</a> to write the script called <strong><em>Longhino: Buhay at Pagpapakasakit</em></strong> (Longinus: His Life and Sacrifice). In the 1974 version of the Carunungan script, the traditional Longhino playlet became a longer, scripted play that uses a stage and its adjacent grounds, as well as taped dialogue and background music, mostly from the movie <strong><em>The Ten Commandments</em></strong>, 1956. Schoolteachers enact the following scenes: Claudia blames Pilate for having condemned Christ; the Pharisees complain that Christ&rsquo;s apostles may steal His body and say He is resurrected; Pilate orders Longhino to guard Jesus&rsquo;s tomb; Longhino refuses and runs around proclaiming Christ&rsquo;s divinity; Pilate&rsquo;s soldiers pursue and capture the new convert; Longhino prays to Jesus and is beheaded; and finally, Longhino&rsquo;s body is laid on a stretcher and brought to the church, where all the morion say a last prayer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the pugutan and habulan, which was once performed in the town&rsquo;s streets and open spaces, now centered on its staging in the town plaza&rsquo;s open stage. Pilate and his wife Claudia became main characters of the play, and long exchanges of dialogue required actors who were articulate and knowledgeable in memorizing long lines. What used to be a vow of piety by the local farmers and fisherfolk became a task taken over by the then Department of Education, Culture and Sports. This prompted teachers to take on the roles of the main characters of the pugutan. Changes also manifested in the morion mask. Back then, the morion mask was made of locally found materials, such as coconut leaves, corn husks, and flowers from the fields. The popular morion mask&rsquo;s expressions of anger, anxiety, sleepiness, happiness, and stupidity created a distance between the ordinary people and the anonymous morion. But due to the intervention of politicians and local government, contests encouraged the creation of the morion masks for commercial purposes in the likeness of the Western centurion, much against the traditional mask-making ritual where secrecy was kept as part of the pious penitent&rsquo;s vow and masks are carved based on the penitents original interpretation of the centurion. These innovations were initially met with amusement, but eventually the people tired of the formulaic script and looked forward to new ideas in familiar material whenever the pugutan was dramatized. To encourage people to watch the pugutan, some dramatizations included Pilate&rsquo;s dream about the belly dancers. Instead of the Longhino story as the centerpiece of the dramatization, Claudia became the focal point of the story. Innovations attracted more and more tourists, thus raising the demand for the production of the morion masks and prompting some morion to sell their antique masks to foreign tourists (Mandia 2002; Adachi 1994; dela Paz 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1992, in the town of Gasan, innovations were introduced to the Carunungan script of the Longhino story through the intervention of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a>. Through close consultations with local teachers and cultural leaders, the <strong><em>Bagong Longhino</em></strong> was dramatized with particular emphasis on maintaining the qualities of the traditional practice of the habulan while using new technologies of presentation. The habulan was emphasized with different representatives from the basic sectors as Longhino&rsquo;s <strong>takbuhan</strong> or hiding place. Issues on local politics as well as local economic relations and environmental concerns were tackled in the improvised dialogue that ensued during Longhino&rsquo;s run for safety. The kalutang was used as musical background while local materials, such as coconut leaves, were used to create Longhino&rsquo;s costume. The <strong>taka</strong> (papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;) technology was used in creating <strong>higante</strong> (giant puppets), symbolizing the basic sectors that extended their support and faith in Longhino. The whole town of Gasan was transformed into a living stage, similar to the use of open spaces in the traditional pugutan. The habulan took place in the marketplace, the hills, and the beach, and ended in the town plaza where the much-awaited pugutan was done (dela Paz 2014). Throughout the chase, the crowd followed Longhino, as spectators in the chase and as unwitting supporters and followers of the chase. In the pugutan scene, a long red cloth symbolized the continuing search for truth as Longhino&rsquo;s mask was hoisted in a pole to signify his death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time, the moryonan innovations have been made in consonance with the changing technologies of expression and interests of the local folk. Local organizations were put up by residents to support the moryonan. Political leaders poured in support for the moryonan and its potential as a major component in the province&rsquo;s tourism program. Stages were constructed for the holding of the pugutan, with prizes at stake for the best setup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the years, other areas have invited practitioners from Marinduque to enact the moryonan in their local communities, to make the Lenten rites livelier. The moryonan&rsquo;s distinct charm has attracted millions of people since the colonial times, when <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5602\">Mariano Ponce</a> once mentioned the staging of &ldquo;The Beheading of Longinus&rdquo; in his <strong><em>Folklore Bulaque&ntilde;o</em></strong> (Roces 1980). Its distinct qualities as a Lenten ritual have paved the way for its replication in other parts of the country. Indeed, the moryonan has created a mark of distinction for the people of Marinduque as a sacred vow of piety and as a major tourist attraction, thus gaining for the province its unique name as &ldquo;Morionduque.&rdquo;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\"><strong>Nicanor G.

Locally referred to as <strong>moryon</strong>, <strong>morion</strong>,or <strong>moriones</strong>, these men have made a vow to reenact the pugutan on Easter Sunday. Locals refer to this dramatization and series of rituals related to it as the Moriones festival or moryonan, a colorful mix of local faith and Catholicism. Based on the Biblical story, a drop of Christ&#x2019;s blood spurted into the eyes of the one-eyed Roman soldier Longhino, and cured him of his blindness, thereby turning him into a convert of Christ. The <strong>pagmomoryon</strong>, literally referring to the act of becoming a moryon, has been part of the people&#x2019;s devotion and expression of faith in God. The term <strong>moryon</strong> (English, &#x201C;morion&#x201D;) refers to a penitent, usually a man, who pledges to wear the moryon mask during Lent as a vow of faith to do penance similar to that of Christ&#x2019;s suffering. Local penitents regard the pagmomoryon as a pious vow and a gesture of appreciation for all the good graces bestowed upon their families or as a covenant with God so that their personal wishes may be granted (Adachi 1994; Goquingco 1980; Mandia 2002; Roces 1980)."

The morion will go after you.) &#x201C;<em>Moro yoon</em>&#x201D; (Those Moro) became moryon<em>.</em>Through time, the term was also used by the locals to refer to strangers or invaders. Another explanation takes note of the use of the word morion in souvenir programs that are mostly written in English, thus the term morion or moriones in its plural form."

At daybreak, they come down from the mountain with a sword lance or with a <strong>kalutang</strong> (wooden disc), more often by themselves or sometimes with a group. The morion remain silent as they walk to the town. Sometimes, they strike their kalutang in a distinct rhythm.

Some perform dances or songs or play pranks on people or frighten children, making sure that their masks conceal their identities. Sometimes, the morion get invited for a snack or a drink or an invitation to sing or dance to a local tune. Amidst the intense heat or exhaustion, the morion must keep on walking around town as an expression of faith and gratitude for graces bestowed upon their families.

The nose and mouth are always large and open. The mask often sports a deep frown, which is cut between the heavy brows, and the ears are large and flat. It commonly carries expressions of fierceness and/or stupidity. The turbante holds the mask in place and is firmly attached through a wire or string. It is often constructed from a light bamboo frame decorated with colored tinsel or antennae made of paper flowers, as has been traditionally seen in most headgears. The number of flowers attached to the headgear represents the number of years the morion has performed the vow. A sword or lance completes the outfit. Horsewhips and wooden staffs in the shape of a snake are also used by the older morion. More conservative morion use the kalutang. These masks and costumes are stored away secretly in a cave until the following year. To keep the impact of the vow and the secrecy of the morion&#x2019;s identity, he neither speaks or sings in a regular tone and only utters birdlike sounds when addressed.

A festive program commences with a parade where morion from Boac and Gasan participate. Skits on local social concerns are presented, followed by an intermission of dancing and chanting. Soon after, smoke is spotted rising in the distance, signifying Christ&#x2019;s return, and Longhino rushes out of the stage proclaiming the glory of Christ&#x2019;s resurrection. Longhino struggles with other Roman soldiers who have been ordered to stop him. He then goes into hiding and the Roman soldiers are ordered to seize him, thus signaling the start of the <strong>habulan</strong> (chase). Longhino runs across open fields, river banks, the rice paddies, up and down coconut trees, and inside houses as trumpets blare and drums beat. Three times Longhino is captured and three times he escapes. Finally, an exhausted Longhino is captured and put to trial on the makeshift stage created in the public plaza. Pilate and his men try to convince Longhino to renounce his faith in Christ, but he refuses and is thus sentenced to death. Longhino is then taken by the <strong>berdugo</strong> (executioner) and brought to a platform, where the crowd pleads for his life. Longhino, during his last moments, delivers an impassioned speech where he recounts how the blood of Christ restored his sight. He then confirms his faith and accepts his fate. A bottle of red wine is poured over his neck as the fatal blow is delivered. The mask of Longhino is then held up to signify his death.

				"value": "The antipo in Marinduque is done on Good Friday as a gesture of gratitude for a cured illness or the atonement of a sinful past. It begins at noon and ends with the start of the afternoon procession. Theantipo is believed to be derived from the Latin word&#xA0;<em>antiphona&#xA0;</em>(antiphon), or the verses sung by priests before chanting the psalms. The frequency with which a morion participates in the antipo depends on his vow or <strong>panata</strong>. Some join the antipo every Holy Week, while others do so for the number of years that they have vowed to do. While participation in the antipo is not a requirement to be regarded as a true morion, one must have undergone the exercise at least once. Before Good Friday, the morion prepare the pieces of bamboo sticks that they will use to flagellate themselves. The number of sticks represent the number of years the morion penitent has vowed to participate in the antipo. At noon, the morion come together in the local cemetery to receive instructions from the leader called the <strong>magkakadlit</strong>. Prayers are said before a large cross that has been put up in the cemetery grounds. After this, the morion start whipping themselves in the upper and lower arms, chest, back, and other muscular parts until their muscles have become numb. Then, the magkakadlit makes incisions on the muscular parts of their bodies, using a sharp thin blade. The morion then whip these incisions until blood flows. Before the day ends, the morion join the procession, positioning themselves at the rear part behind the other morion. Here, the morion take part in the popular <strong>agawan</strong> (squabble) for the amulets or <strong>anting-anting</strong>, which include all adornments, candles, ropes, and images used in the procession. The possession of these objects is believed to bring good luck and good health as well as protection from danger or even death. During the procession, the morion lie facedown at the entrance of the church so that people can walk on them. This practice is considered to be another way of showing devotion to God and acquiring supernatural powers. A bath in the sea, which is believed to heal the mortal wounds acquired during the rites, completes the antipo for the morion (Adachi 1994; Mandia 2002)."

Local historians say that the first moryonan was held that year, with the first Longhino role being performed by a certain &#x201C;Tatang Bentong.&#x201D; At eight in the morning, he would wear his mask and roam around the town. After two hours, he would go back to the church and ring the church bells, and then he would roam around the streets and go back to the church at noon to do the same. Later, he included the Crucifixion in the moryonan."

Longhino would usually engage the Roman &#x201C;soldiers&#x201D; in a long chase across the fields, rivers, mountains, and seashore. The people would usually follow the scene of the chase, anywhere it went. As soon as the Roman soldiers caught Longhino, thepugutan would be done at the place where he was caught, oftentimes along the seashore. Back then, ordinary people improvised scenes from memory, with only their bodies and their faith as resources for the dramatization. The dramatization was lively, spontaneous, unstructured, and dependent on the improvisational skills of the penitents. After the pugutan, Longhino would proceed to share a bountiful dinner with his friends as a gesture of goodwill to the community (dela Paz 2014; Mandia 2002)."

In the 1974 version of the Carunungan script, the traditional Longhino playlet became a longer, scripted play that uses a stage and its adjacent grounds, as well as taped dialogue and background music, mostly from the movie <strong><em>The Ten Commandments</em></strong>, 1956. Schoolteachers enact the following scenes: Claudia blames Pilate for having condemned Christ; the Pharisees complain that Christ&#x2019;s apostles may steal His body and say He is resurrected; Pilate orders Longhino to guard Jesus&#x2019;s tomb; Longhino refuses and runs around proclaiming Christ&#x2019;s divinity; Pilate&#x2019;s soldiers pursue and capture the new convert; Longhino prays to Jesus and is beheaded; and finally, Longhino&#x2019;s body is laid on a stretcher and brought to the church, where all the morion say a last prayer."

Pilate and his wife Claudia became main characters of the play, and long exchanges of dialogue required actors who were articulate and knowledgeable in memorizing long lines. What used to be a vow of piety by the local farmers and fisherfolk became a task taken over by the then Department of Education, Culture and Sports. This prompted teachers to take on the roles of the main characters of the pugutan. Changes also manifested in the morion mask. Back then, the morion mask was made of locally found materials, such as coconut leaves, corn husks, and flowers from the fields. The popular morion mask&#x2019;s expressions of anger, anxiety, sleepiness, happiness, and stupidity created a distance between the ordinary people and the anonymous morion. But due to the intervention of politicians and local government, contests encouraged the creation of the morion masks for commercial purposes in the likeness of the Western centurion, much against the traditional mask-making ritual where secrecy was kept as part of the pious penitent&#x2019;s vow and masks are carved based on the penitents original interpretation of the centurion. These innovations were initially met with amusement, but eventually the people tired of the formulaic script and looked forward to new ideas in familiar material whenever the pugutan was dramatized. To encourage people to watch the pugutan, some dramatizations included Pilate&#x2019;s dream about the belly dancers. Instead of the Longhino story as the centerpiece of the dramatization, Claudia became the focal point of the story. Innovations attracted more and more tourists, thus raising the demand for the production of the morion masks and prompting some morion to sell their antique masks to foreign tourists (Mandia 2002; Adachi 1994; dela Paz 2014)."

				"value": "In 1992, in the town of Gasan, innovations were introduced to the Carunungan script of the Longhino story through the intervention of the <a href=\"/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a>. Through close consultations with local teachers and cultural leaders, the <strong><em>Bagong Longhino</em></strong> was dramatized with particular emphasis on maintaining the qualities of the traditional practice of the habulan while using new technologies of presentation. The habulan was emphasized with different representatives from the basic sectors as Longhino&#x2019;s <strong>takbuhan</strong> or hiding place. Issues on local politics as well as local economic relations and environmental concerns were tackled in the improvised dialogue that ensued during Longhino&#x2019;s run for safety. The kalutang was used as musical background while local materials, such as coconut leaves, were used to create Longhino&#x2019;s costume. The <strong>taka</strong> (papier-m&#xE2;ch&#xE9;) technology was used in creating <strong>higante</strong> (giant puppets), symbolizing the basic sectors that extended their support and faith in Longhino. The whole town of Gasan was transformed into a living stage, similar to the use of open spaces in the traditional pugutan. The habulan took place in the marketplace, the hills, and the beach, and ended in the town plaza where the much-awaited pugutan was done (dela Paz 2014). Throughout the chase, the crowd followed Longhino, as spectators in the chase and as unwitting supporters and followers of the chase. In the pugutan scene, a long red cloth symbolized the continuing search for truth as Longhino&#x2019;s mask was hoisted in a pole to signify his death."

Its distinct qualities as a Lenten ritual have paved the way for its replication in other parts of the country. Indeed, the moryonan has created a mark of distinction for the people of Marinduque as a sacred vow of piety and as a major tourist attraction, thus gaining for the province its unique name as &#x201C;Morionduque.&#x201D;<span class>&#xA0;</span>"

		"text": "<p><strong>Musical theater</strong> refers to plays in which music is an integral part. It includes religious <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> forms as well as established forms such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, the musicals, and the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>opera</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Music has been a major part of Philippine theater from its earliest stages and forms. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> in indigenous communities usually featured chanting and singing as integral parts of the ceremonies. Songs and dances and their combinations&mdash;song-dance, dance-drama&mdash;were <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic</a> forms that assumed music as an essential element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The religious drama forms that took root during the Spanish colonial period often included music. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a>, for example, or the reenactment of the search for an inn in Bethlehem, has Joseph and Mary singing their plea for shelter, which is denied in song by the <strong>may bahay</strong> (landlords, houseowners). Music for this form may be borrowed from other parishes or created by a local composer who usually sets a local poet&rsquo;s words to music. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> or shepherds&rsquo; dance use <strong>villancicos</strong>, Christmas songs of Spanish or Mexican origin, but many songs have been especially composed for them. In Leyte and Samar, pastores and panunuluyan have merged and yielded such songs as &ldquo;Pasayluwa&rdquo; (seeking entry), &ldquo;Tagbalay&rdquo; (addressing the household), and &ldquo;Lisinsiya&rdquo; (asking forgiveness for having been &ldquo;bothered&rdquo; by the singers). The Palm Sunday <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/463\"><strong>pangangaluluwa</strong></a> for All Souls&rsquo; Day, and the <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\"><strong>flores de mayo</strong></a> are all sung. The weeklong <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> or traditional passion play has dialogue in verses that are chanted, as well as music built in where appropriate: when Salome dances for the head of John the Baptist; when the angel appears in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> to tell Mary that her son has risen (&ldquo;Regina Coeli, Laetare&rdquo;); and of course in the scenes of glory, like the Assumption of the Virgin into heaven. Holy characters march in to a slow <strong>punebre</strong> while bad characters swagger in to a fast <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>paso doble</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> or play in verse may or may not have the characters singing and/or dancing, but music is imperative to its action: <strong>martsa</strong> for all the royal entries and exits; <strong>paso doble</strong> for the <strong>torneo</strong>, <strong>paseo</strong>, and <strong>batalla</strong>; and the occasional waltz for the <strong>karansa</strong>. A brass band is necessary to its staging. It fell out of mainstream favor in the early 1900s. In 2008, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2915\">Dulaang UP</a> staged a new version of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5085\">Francisco Baltazar</a>&rsquo;s komedya <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></em></strong>, with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2785\">Carol Bello</a> and choreography and direction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3245\">Dexter Santos</a>. This version used neo-ethnic <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/793\">rock music</a>, employing indigenous instruments like the djembe <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a>,&nbsp;<em>kulintang&nbsp;</em>(gong chime),&nbsp;<em>kubing&nbsp;</em>(jaw <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/812\">harp</a>), rainmaker, and others, as well as the present-day keyboard, electric <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, and drum set.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drama or prose play of the early years of the American colonial period may have had occasional songs, and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\"><strong>drama simboliko</strong></a> (&ldquo;seditious&rdquo; drama) used them as political statement. The &ldquo;Himno Nacional&rdquo; (National Anthem), forbidden by the Americans, would occasionally be played without warning, with great dramatic and emotional effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Opera was introduced into the country by traveling Italian companies in the late 19th century. Using local singers and musicians for choruses and orchestras, Italian singers performed operas like <strong><em>Aida</em></strong>, <strong><em>Il Trovatore</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Lucia de Lammermoor</em></strong>. The first Filipino opera, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/997\"><strong>Sangdugong Panaguinip</strong></a></em></strong> (<strong><em>Dreamed Alliance</em></strong>), with music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3910\">Ladislao Bonus</a> and libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a>, was premiered in 1902. It was not until after World War II, however, that Filipino composers came out with more original Filipino operas, among which were <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3965\">Felipe Padilla de Leon</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/962\"><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></em></strong> (Touch Me Not), 1957, and <strong><em><strong><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></strong></em></strong> (Subversion), 1970; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4111\">Eliseo M.

The Philippine Opera Company, founded in 1999 by artistic director Karla Gutierrez, has been staging opera productions regularly. The group performs its productions not only in theaters but also in malls, churches, community centers, parks, and schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It is the sarsuwela, however, that is the major, dominant, and most widespread form of musical theater in the Philippines. It derives from the Spanish <strong>zarzuela</strong>, which Filipinos learned from Spanish troupes that performed in Manila and other cities, from Spanish performers who stayed to train Filipinos, and from Spanish writers who wrote zarzuelas for performance in the country. The form moved into the native languages, and thus caused Filipino playwrights and composers to evolve the Filipino sarsuwela. Musical accompaniment for the sarsuwela might range from a single piano, guitar, or even harmonica, to small or larger groups of piano, violin, viola, clarinet, flute, trombone, cornet, double bass, drum, and cymbals, depending on the group&rsquo;s finances or the town&rsquo;s resources. The fact that <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a>, &ldquo;Queen of the Sarsuwela&rdquo; in the 1920s and 1930s, could say with confidence that &ldquo;a sarsuwela has 20 songs divided into <strong>preludio</strong>, <strong>concertante</strong>, <strong>solo</strong>, <strong>dueto</strong>, <strong>terceto</strong>, and <strong>coro</strong>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;a simple tune is played while the curtain is lowered between acts,&rdquo; shows that the sarsuwela was a set and standardized form of musical theater that had evolved a structure and standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the outstanding <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> sarsuwela of the prewar era are <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (Not Wounded), 1902, music by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4198\">Fulgencio Tolentino</a> and libretto by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3847\">Bonifacio Abdon</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>La Rosa</em></strong> (The Rose), 1908; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong>Dalagang Bukid</strong></a></em></strong> (Country Maiden), 1917; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3147\">Precioso Palma</a> and Leon Ignacio&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a></em></strong> (After the Darkness), 1920; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a> and Leon Ignacio&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/650\"><strong>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</strong></a></em></strong> (At the Mercy of Sharks), 1921; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2888\">Servando de los Angeles</a> and Leon Ignacio&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/582\"><strong>Ang Kiri</strong></a></em></strong> (The Flirt), 1926; and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5757\">Engracio Valmonte</a> and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor S.

The monthlong event had sarsuwela productions, such as <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong><em>Paglipas ng Dilim</em></strong></a> (After the Darkness) by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">University of the East Drama Company</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong><em>Walang Sugat</em></strong></a> (Not Wounded) by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation</a>, <strong><em>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</em></strong> (At the Mercy of Sharks) by the Far Eastern University Art Theatre Clinique, <strong><em>Ang Kiri</em></strong> (The Flirt) by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang Unibersidad ng Pilipinas</a>, and <strong><em>Iloilo Zarsuela: Padayon ang Istorya</em></strong> (Iloilo Zarsuela: The Story Continues) by the UP Visayas Alumni Theatre Company.

Local theater artists, especially those who had studied theater, music, and performance abroad, began to study, adapt, incorporate, and stage international trends and developments into the local milieu. Composers, librettists, lyricists, and book writers would draw from different musical genres, such as rock, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/790\">pop</a>, rap, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/778\">hip-hop</a>, and electronic dance music. In their development and creation of original Filipino musicals, some Filipino productions blended indigenous Asian instruments with western instruments, resulting in <strong>ethnic rock musicals</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early examples of Filipino musicals are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2912\">Dulaang Sibol</a>&rsquo;s oft-performed <strong><em>Sinta</em></strong> (Beloved), 1973, which is an adaptation of <strong><em>The Fantasticks</em></strong>, with Filipino characters and music; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3263\">Sining Kambayoka</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/613\"><strong>Mga Kuwentong Maranao</strong></a></em></strong> (Maranao Tales), 1974, which uses the folk form called <strong>bayok</strong> effectively as singing/chanting theater, and their musical adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/635\"><strong>Ang Paglilitis ni Mang Serapio</strong></a></em></strong> (The Trial of Old Serapio), which gave it new life.

It ranges from plays with incidental music or occasional songs called <strong>drama musical</strong>, to those in which music is secondary to other elements (e.g., religious dramas/dramatizations, komedya, etc.), through the plays classifiable as sarsuwela/musical/operetta, in which songs function as part of the dialogue and music is fundamental element, all the way to deliberate attempts to create Filipino opera, in which all parts are sung, or music and lyrics have equal weight, or in which music is the dominant element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The development of Philippine musical theater has shown not only the great affinity of the Filipinos for music, or the great dependence of their theater on music, but especially the viability of musical theater in all the settings in which theater is found in Philippine life: schools; church groups; rural and urban communities; factories and other workplaces; and nonprofessional, semiprofessional, and professional theaters.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5291\"><strong>Doreen G.

The <a href=\"/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a>, for example, or the reenactment of the search for an inn in Bethlehem, has Joseph and Mary singing their plea for shelter, which is denied in song by the <strong>may bahay</strong> (landlords, houseowners). Music for this form may be borrowed from other parishes or created by a local composer who usually sets a local poet&#x2019;s words to music. The <a href=\"/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a> or shepherds&#x2019; dance use <strong>villancicos</strong>, Christmas songs of Spanish or Mexican origin, but many songs have been especially composed for them. In Leyte and Samar, pastores and panunuluyan have merged and yielded such songs as &#x201C;Pasayluwa&#x201D; (seeking entry), &#x201C;Tagbalay&#x201D; (addressing the household), and &#x201C;Lisinsiya&#x201D; (asking forgiveness for having been &#x201C;bothered&#x201D; by the singers). The Palm Sunday <a href=\"/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a>, the <a href=\"/7/55/463\"><strong>pangangaluluwa</strong></a> for All Souls&#x2019; Day, and the <a href=\"/7/55/453\"><strong>flores de mayo</strong></a> are all sung. The weeklong <a href=\"/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> or traditional passion play has dialogue in verses that are chanted, as well as music built in where appropriate: when Salome dances for the head of John the Baptist; when the angel appears in the <a href=\"/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> to tell Mary that her son has risen (&#x201C;Regina Coeli, Laetare&#x201D;); and of course in the scenes of glory, like the Assumption of the Virgin into heaven. Holy characters march in to a slow <strong>punebre</strong> while bad characters swagger in to a fast <a href=\"/6/46/81\"><strong>paso doble</strong></a>."

				"value": "It is the sarsuwela, however, that is the major, dominant, and most widespread form of musical theater in the Philippines. It derives from the Spanish <strong>zarzuela</strong>, which Filipinos learned from Spanish troupes that performed in Manila and other cities, from Spanish performers who stayed to train Filipinos, and from Spanish writers who wrote zarzuelas for performance in the country. The form moved into the native languages, and thus caused Filipino playwrights and composers to evolve the Filipino sarsuwela. Musical accompaniment for the sarsuwela might range from a single piano, guitar, or even harmonica, to small or larger groups of piano, violin, viola, clarinet, flute, trombone, cornet, double bass, drum, and cymbals, depending on the group&#x2019;s finances or the town&#x2019;s resources. The fact that <a href=\"/7/7/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a>, &#x201C;Queen of the Sarsuwela&#x201D; in the 1920s and 1930s, could say with confidence that &#x201C;a sarsuwela has 20 songs divided into <strong>preludio</strong>, <strong>concertante</strong>, <strong>solo</strong>, <strong>dueto</strong>, <strong>terceto</strong>, and <strong>coro</strong>,&#x201D; and &#x201C;a simple tune is played while the curtain is lowered between acts,&#x201D; shows that the sarsuwela was a set and standardized form of musical theater that had evolved a structure and standards."

It is also known as <strong>osanahan</strong>, meaning &ldquo;the place where the osana is held&rdquo;; and <strong>humenta</strong>, meaning &ldquo;donkey.&rdquo; Performed in most Catholic and Aglipayan parishes all over the country, this custom embroiders on the original Roman Catholic ritual of the blessing and procession of the palms, by bringing the procession outside the church and adding songs to it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the morning of Palm Sunday, in Malolos, Bulacan, after the priest blesses a wilderness of decorated <strong>palaspas</strong> or coconut palm fronds in church, he picks up a huge palaspas and uses it as a staff as he walks down the church aisle into the patio. On the priest&rsquo;s path throughout the procession, women spread out overskirts called <strong>tapis</strong>, in imitation of the women of Jerusalem who laid out their cloaks to welcome the Messiah.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On each corner of the church square stands a <strong>kubol</strong>, an elevated wooden balcony covered with cloth and decorated with flowers and arches of palaspas on the sides and top. From the church, the priest walks to the first kubol, and here young girls in white sing a secular version of the Palm Sunday antiphon &ldquo;Hosanna Filio David, Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini&rdquo; (Hossana to the Son of David, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord) to the accompaniment of a local band. As they sing, the girls take handfuls of flower petals from their baskets to shower on the priest. There is a mad scramble for these petals, which are used as medicine or planted with the rice seedlings to ensure a good harvest. After the song, the procession moves on to the second, the third, and the fourth kubol for other versions of the &ldquo;Hosanna,&rdquo; and finally findsits way to the church&rsquo;s main doors, which are closed at first to signify the Pharisees&rsquo; refusal of the Messiah. The priest knocks on the door three times with the bottom of his palaspas, the door opens, and all enter for the mass of Palm Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In some Bulacan parishes, the osanais also called the humenta because the <strong>karo</strong> (float) of the image of Christ riding on a donkey follows the priest throughout the procession.

Before midnight, the Holy Couple come down from their float, walk to the church, and ascend the stairs to an elaborate Bethlehem scene on the altar, where they are welcomed by &ldquo;angels&rdquo; in white costumes and led into a &ldquo;cave&rdquo; where they disappear behind the curtains. At the &ldquo;Gloria,&rdquo; the curtains of the &ldquo;cave&rdquo; are drawn, revealing the Nativity scene, with the images of Mary and Joseph wearing the costumes of their live counterparts. Wooden angels descend from the &ldquo;heavens&rdquo; and several <strong>angelita</strong> (girls dressed as angels) adore the Christ Child as the drums and orchestra play the jubilant &ldquo;Gloria.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of its popularity, the form of the panunuluyan has been used by different groups to reinterpret the search for an inn by Mary and Joseph according to sectoral realities.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>pastores</strong>, from Spanish&nbsp;<em>pastores&nbsp;</em>meaning &ldquo;shepherds,&rdquo; is a dramatization of the shepherds&rsquo;s adoration of the Infant Jesus in Bethlehem, usually presented in the days just before Christmas or on Christmas Eve; it can also refer to a band of singers dressed as shepherds who perform Christmas songs and dances from house to house during the Christmas season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Far north in Cagayan, there is the <strong>infantes</strong>, which is the locality&rsquo;s equivalent for the pastores<em>.</em>The girls dress like baby dolls and click bamboo castanets, while the boys beat on bamboo tubes called <strong>tubtubong</strong> <em>.</em>The Three Kings are represented as simulated <strong>higante</strong> (giants), while accompanying angels are teased by a comic who represents the devil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bicol, the pastores are 12 adults or children, mostly female, led by a <strong>capitana</strong> (female captain). The number probably alludes to the apostles with the capitanarepresenting Christ. The &ldquo;shepherdesses&rdquo; wear full skirts, round-necked blouses with puffed sleeves, and wide-brimmed hats, while the &ldquo;shepherds&rdquo; sport long-sleeved shirts, breast and waistbands, and decorated hats. Groups dress in a uniform color&mdash;red, blue, or green. At every house, they sing, to the accompaniment of a small orchestra (<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar,</a> <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/830\">violin</a>, bass, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/807\">drum</a>), a series of Spanish <strong>villancicos</strong> or carols (including &ldquo;Pastores a Belen,&rdquo; which is attributed to <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>), as well as <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> carols, while executing dance movements and patterns, using handkerchiefs and rattan <strong>arko</strong> or arches gaily trimmed with colorful paper as props. They are gifted with money or food by the owners of houses at which they sing. To encourage the barrio people to continue with the tradition, pastores contests are held on stage in Legazpi, Albay, during the Christmas season.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Most colorful in Bicol is <strong>pastores Talisay</strong> in Camarines Norte. Looking colorfully Mexican, it has women swirling their voluminous&nbsp;<em>poblana&nbsp;</em>skirts like cascading rainbows, while the men bear papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; horses to signify that they are riding up and down hills. With kaleidoscopic movements, the women also carry arches of flowers. Another in Pilar, Sorsogon, is <strong>pastores Santo Ni&ntilde;o</strong>, where boys dress in Middle Eastern shepherds&rsquo; garb (long white soutanes and head scarves with headband), the girls in white or pastel dresses, usually wearing hats with ribbons or flowers. They dance to &ldquo;Vamos a Belen&rdquo;played by a&nbsp;<em>rondalla&nbsp;</em>and a drum. Still another is <strong>pastores Tubog</strong> in Oas, Albay, where again shepherds dress in the Middle Eastern way, with children carrying lambs (made of bamboo and rice paper) as&nbsp;<em>pi&ntilde;atas&nbsp;</em>and floral arches. Six pairs of girls and boys are led by a capitana. Characteristically, they wear abaca slippers with simulated cloth leggings and sing in Spanish, Latin, and Bikol. This is done on the feast of the Three Kings. <strong>Pastores Bungiawon</strong> is also attributed to Oas in Albay. Here, the girls put ruffles of recycled plastic bags around their skirts and arches. In Mercedes, Eastern Samar, skirts are made of crepe paper, and blouses from commercial plastic sacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her masteral thesis in the University of the Philippines, Jiye A. Margate describes the <strong>pastoras</strong> from Camarines Sur. In the <strong>pastora Baao</strong> and <strong>pastora Bombon</strong>, girls wear the usual pretty dresses and hats and sing to different musical accompaniments: in Baao, originally to the violin, double bass, and guitar, but now only to the saxophone; and in Bombon, originally to saxophone, violin, guitar, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/809\">flute</a>, but now more often just to a guitar. Here girls train under their elders and danceas <strong>panata</strong> (vow) to the Virgin Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Cebu and Leyte, the pastores, played by a group of children wearing hats with bands, sing and dance at different houses, confront and drive away the devil, who dissuades them from visiting the Messiah, and then proceed on their journey to adore the child. Sometimes a couple playing Mary and Joseph presents them with the image of the Christ Child at some point in the journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Out in Cebu is <strong>pastores Kalawit</strong> in one of the Camotes Islands, where middle-aged women dance as their fellow fisherfolk watch them. In the <strong>nacio pastores</strong> of New Washington, Aklan, the ritualists dance with the image of the <strong>Ni&ntilde;o dormido</strong> (asleep) and sing old villancicos<em>.&nbsp;</em>In Ibajay, Aklan, the <strong>bailo</strong> (from&nbsp;<em>baile</em>) <strong>de pastores</strong> features boys and girls dressed in white with red waistbands and hats with flowers and carrying tambourines while dancing.

Six pairs of girls and boys are led by a capitana. Characteristically, they wear abaca slippers with simulated cloth leggings and sing in Spanish, Latin, and Bikol. This is done on the feast of the Three Kings. <strong>Pastores Bungiawon</strong> is also attributed to Oas in Albay.

		"text": "<p><strong>Puppet theater</strong> is a form of drama in which the characters are puppets&mdash;inanimate objects manipulated by a puppeteer in front of an audience. The basic types are finger puppets, hand puppets, rod puppets, shadow puppets, and string puppets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/445\"><strong>carillo</strong></a> of the 19th century, also known as <strong>potei</strong>, <strong>kikimut</strong>, and <strong>titire</strong> in Pampanga, is one of the early forms of puppetry in Philippine theater history. It did not, however, continue into the 20th century. The carillo made use of crudely painted scenery and cardboard figures held up by means of wooden sticks before a lighted lamp projected against a white sheet. By means of pantomimic movement and dialogue provided by the manipulators, they presented stories from the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido</em>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a> about lives of saints or the adventures of chivalric figures&mdash;for example, <strong><em>Don Juan Te&ntilde;oso</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1880\"><strong><em>Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></em></strong></a> (Adarna Bird), <strong><em>Siete Infantes de Lara</em></strong> (Seven Sons of Lara)&mdash;the same material used in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>higante</strong> of Angono, Rizal, can also be considered part of puppetry. These are giant figures measuring 8-11 feet in height and 4-5 feet in diameter. Traditionally, the bodies of these higante are made of bamboo frames covered in cloth and the heads are made of papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;. Over time, new materials, such as aluminum for the frame body and resin for the head, were used to create these huge puppets. The higante are carried by men hidden inside the hollow bodies of the three-dimensional figures and are paraded during the feast of San Clemente, the patron saint of fisherfolk. Higante usually represent farmers, fisherfolk, and mythological creatures. They wear traditional Filipino costumes and a <strong>panleeg</strong> (bib or scarf) to cover the part where the head and the body are connected. Social classes of the higante are distinguished by their facial features. For example, landlords are depicted with pointed noses, rosy cheeks, and fair complexion, while the fisherfolk and farmers have flat noses and dark skin tone. Although the higante became popular in Angono, other areas have their own version of these huge figures, such as in Lucban, Quezon; Gasan, Marinduque; Miag-ao, Iloilo; and Kalibo, Aklan.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1930s, puppetry in the form of ventriloquism became known in the Philippines through the efforts of Manuel Urbano, more popularly known as <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4346\">Manuel Conde</a>. When he was in grade school in Daet, he asked a ventriloquist named Austria, a performer in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3911\">Borromeo Lou</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> troupe, to teach him the techniques of ventriloquism. He learned the art and so around 1938, he asked his friend, Tony Dumlao, to make him a doll, a local version of the Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy dolls then sold at Beck&rsquo;s Department Store. The doll, which looked Filipino and funny, was christened Kiko Tolosa. The doll also instigated the renaming of &ldquo;Manuel Urbano&rdquo; to &ldquo;Manuel Conde,&rdquo; since it was difficult for a ventriloquist to pronounce &ldquo;Urbano.&rdquo; Kiko and Conde performed on the <strong><em>Purico Hour</em></strong> over the radio, at stage shows, and on special occasions for many years (Tiongson 2008a, 17).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Conde&rsquo;s time, the next reference to puppet theater was in the early 1970s with the founding of Alsa Balutan, headed by Tessie Ordo&ntilde;a, who studied puppet therapy at the London Puppet Center through the sponsorship of the British Council and observed puppetry in Europe. Alsa Balutan was a group of 15 puppeteers that performed from the poorest tenement houses to the most luxurious hotels in the Philippines. The group used muppets, or hand puppets with movable mouths, inspired by Jim Henson&rsquo;s Muppets from the television show <strong><em>Sesame Street</em></strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also in the 1970s, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a> of the University of the Philippines (UP) started working on puppets with a group of students (comprising grade school to graduate school students). After the success of her first full-length puppet play, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/500\"><strong><em>Abadeja: Ang Ating Sinderela</em></strong></a> (Abadeja: Our Own Cinderella), performed at UP in 1977, the group refused to disband; at the performance of <strong><em>Tatluhan</em></strong>, three one-act plays, in Rizal Park in 1978, it was introduced as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3304\">Teatrong Mulat ng Pilipinas</a>. Since then, Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s works have been mainly for this group. She is its writer and artistic director, her husband Manuel Bonifacio is its producer, and her daughter Amihan, herself a puppeteer, musician, and composer, is assistant director.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Teatrong Mulat makes extensive use of Asian puppets, especially <strong>wayang kulit</strong>, <strong>wayang golek</strong>, and <strong>bunraku</strong>, but within stories drawn from Asian (Indian, Burmese, Japanese, Chinese, etc.) and Philippine folklore, such as <strong><em>Ang Paghuhukom</em></strong> (The Trial), 1979; <strong><em>Ang Pagong at ang Tsonggo</em></strong> (The Turtle and the Monkey), 1980; <strong><em>Sa Kasimu-simula</em></strong> (In the Beginning), 1981; and <strong><em>Si Suan</em></strong>, <strong><em>Si Suan</em></strong> (This Suan, This Suan), 1983. It has therefore developed puppet characters from Filipino folklore, such as Tsonggo, Matsing, and Abadeja. A signal achievement has been <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/641\"><strong><em>Papet <strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong></em></strong></a> (The Passion of Jesus Christ in Puppetry), 1985, which melds the Christian tradition and its religious folk theater (the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/788\"><strong>pasyon</strong></a> and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>) with Asian puppetry both past and present. In the late 1990s, Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s dream came true when the Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio Teatro Papet Museo was built. It houses an auditorium for puppet performances, a puppet museum, and other spaces for creative endeavors. Teatrong Mulat is also the National Center of the international puppet organization Union Internationale de la Marionnette. In 2004, Teatrong Mulat staged its version of the popular Indian epic <strong><em>Ramayana</em></strong>, titled <strong><em>Sita &amp; Rama: Papet Ramayana</em></strong>, with text and puppets by Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio, and arrangement and composition by Cynthia Alexander and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3884\">Joey Ayala</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teatrong Mulat gave support to other puppetry groups. With the initiative of culture scholar Ino Manalo, the group trained and helped organize the youth in Baclayon, Bohol, in 2010. The community-based puppet theater group, composed of neighborhood youngsters, call themselves Usbong Papet Baclayon, and they present puppet shows for Bohol residents and guests interested in discovering the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2336\">Boholano</a> heritage and history. In 2011, the group performed <strong><em>Ang Aniniput ug ang Anunugba</em></strong> (The Firefly and the Moth) written by Manalo. It was performed in a makeshift space on the ground floor entertaining area of Manalo&rsquo;s home in Baclayon. The other play they presented is <strong><em>The Jewel of the Virgin</em></strong>, 2014, also written by Manalo. This puppet theater group is trained by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2796\">Amihan Bonifacio-Ramolete</a>, who also serves as the group&rsquo;s artistic consultant. Sigmund Roy Pecho, UP BA Theater Arts student and Mulat member, also serves as co-trainor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Puppets are also the specialty of the Black Theater of Manila. Founded in 1978, this is the development communication arm of the Philippine Information Agency, which began with a show on nutrition called <strong><em>Kainan Na!</em></strong> (Eating Time!), the main character being Kapitan Munggo. The repertoire has since expanded to include shows on parenthood, dental care, Balik-Probinsiya (Return to the Provinces), care for the disabled, and folktales. Shows are presented on tours to audiences of children (ages 4 to 10 or 9 and above), and on television in shows such as <strong><em>Batang Pinoy</em></strong> (Filipino Child) and <strong><em>Tok-Tok Karatok</em></strong>,which spun off into a travelogue for children called <strong><em>Sa Ating Daigdig</em></strong> (In Our World).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Black Theater uses puppet characters acting as co-hosts on TV shows, shows in the &ldquo;black theater technique&rdquo; (luminous paint on props and costumes, and ultraviolet lights that make objects glow in the dark), hand puppets, string puppets, and muppets. In their repertoire are shows such as <strong><em><strong>Bernardo Carpio</strong></em></strong>, <strong><em><strong>Awit</strong> ng Adarna</em></strong> (Song of the Adarna Bird), <strong><em>Magigue</em></strong>, <strong><em>Aming Pasko</em></strong> (Our Christmas), <strong><em>Tatlong Biik</em></strong> (Three Little Pigs), <strong><em>Mariang Alimango</em></strong> (Maria the Crab), and <strong><em>Smile Ato</em></strong>.The company also conducts workshops on puppet theater production, including topics such as puppetry in education, puppet design and construction, props and set design, scriptwriting and direction, puppet manipulation, lighting and special effects, and voicing and acting for the puppet stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another puppet group is Roppets Edutainment Production Inc, founded by Danny Liwanag in 1987. It produced the first hand puppet magician in the <strong><em>Fancy Magic Show</em></strong>. Along with puppet groups are individual artists, such as ventriloquists, puppeteers who specialize in the art of projecting their voices without moving their lips while moving the mouths of their dummies (puppets) to make it appear that their dummies are the ones talking. Well-known ventriloquists are Ony Carcamo, Talentadong Pinoy Hall of Famer Wanlu Lunaria, and Ruther Urquia, among others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Born out of the Philippine High School for the Arts is A-NI-NO: Makiling Shadow Play Collective, composed mainly of young graduates and student artists. The group premiered at the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> in Feb 1993 with <strong><em>The Shadow Play</em></strong>, an &ldquo;experimental multimedia puppetry production.&rdquo; Through the use of rear-projected imagery, soft candle-enhanced shadow imagery, flashlight-enhanced puppets, Indonesian wooden puppets, and the puppeteers&rsquo; own hand and body shadows, as well as other conventional and experimental puppetry gadgets and methods, the collective interpreted 13 popular, environmental, folk, and original songs (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4224\">Yoyoy Villame</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\">Magellan</a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Granada,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Buchikik&rdquo;) and compositions by Joey Ayala and Edru Abraham&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4033\">Kontra-Gapi</a>. The concept was born out of the school&rsquo;s need to evolve and explore alternative approaches in storytelling with light, shadow, sound, and movement. Initially conceptualized as a co-curricular annual activity for students as part of the school&rsquo;s Visual Arts Week celebration in 1979, it was integrated into the academic program in 1987. The collective has toured the production and conducted workshops for children in different parts of the country (e.g., resettlement area for Pinatubo victims in Tarlac), and it continues to expand and explore new possibilities in puppetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1996, the group became known as <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2741\">Anino Shadowplay Collective</a>, composed of visual artists, educators, cultural workers, musicians, and theater practitioners. In 2006, Anino performed a modern adaptation of Balagtas&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1871\"><strong>Florante at Laura</strong></a></strong></em></strong> (Florante and Laura).

Traditionally, the bodies of these higante are made of bamboo frames covered in cloth and the heads are made of papier-m&#xE2;ch&#xE9;. Over time, new materials, such as aluminum for the frame body and resin for the head, were used to create these huge puppets. The higante are carried by men hidden inside the hollow bodies of the three-dimensional figures and are paraded during the feast of San Clemente, the patron saint of fisherfolk. Higante usually represent farmers, fisherfolk, and mythological creatures. They wear traditional Filipino costumes and a <strong>panleeg</strong> (bib or scarf) to cover the part where the head and the body are connected. Social classes of the higante are distinguished by their facial features. For example, landlords are depicted with pointed noses, rosy cheeks, and fair complexion, while the fisherfolk and farmers have flat noses and dark skin tone. Although the higante became popular in Angono, other areas have their own version of these huge figures, such as in Lucban, Quezon; Gasan, Marinduque; Miag-ao, Iloilo; and Kalibo, Aklan."

He learned the art and so around 1938, he asked his friend, Tony Dumlao, to make him a doll, a local version of the Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy dolls then sold at Beck&#x2019;s Department Store. The doll, which looked Filipino and funny, was christened Kiko Tolosa. The doll also instigated the renaming of &#x201C;Manuel Urbano&#x201D; to &#x201C;Manuel Conde,&#x201D; since it was difficult for a ventriloquist to pronounce &#x201C;Urbano.&#x201D; Kiko and Conde performed on the <strong><em>Purico Hour</em></strong> over the radio, at stage shows, and on special occasions for many years (Tiongson 2008a, 17)."

Alsa Balutan was a group of 15 puppeteers that performed from the poorest tenement houses to the most luxurious hotels in the Philippines.

		"text": "<p>Realism refers to a style of modern theater that aims to give a truthful rendering of reality, through characters that are well rounded, authentic individuals, plots that develop as the individuals interact with each other and with society, and production design (costumes, props, sets, lighting) that helps to produce an &ldquo;illusion of reality&rdquo; or a &ldquo;slice of life&rdquo; on stage. A species of realism is naturalism, which emphasizes the effect of heredity and environment on characters that are out of the ordinary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The movement toward realism began in the 1850s in Europe with French writers like Alexandre Dumas and &Eacute;mile Augier who focused on contemporary characters and social problems. Considered the &ldquo;Father of Realism,&rdquo; however, is Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen who staged <strong><em>The Pillars of Society</em></strong>, a problem play, in 1875. In this as in his <strong><em>A Doll&rsquo;s House</em></strong>, 1879, <strong><em>Ghosts</em></strong>, 1881, and <strong><em>An Enemy of the People</em></strong>, 1882, Ibsen unmasked society&rsquo;s code of &ldquo;morality&rdquo; whose hypocrisy destroys human beings. In <strong><em>The Wild Duck</em></strong>, 1884, <strong><em>Hedda Gabler</em></strong>, 1890, and <strong><em>The Master Builder</em></strong>, 1892, Ibsen concentrated on the psychology of particular individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>As important to realism as Ibsen is the Russian playwright Anton Chekhov, who wrote about upper-class characters whose dreams are frustrated by social developments and the weakness of their own personalities. <strong><em>The Seagull</em></strong>, 1896, <strong><em>Uncle Vanya</em></strong>,1899, <strong><em>The Three Sisters</em></strong>, 1901, and <strong><em>The Cherry Orchard</em></strong>, 1904, present individuals who are tragic and comic, often floating aimlessly in a space that is effectively recreated on stage by a plot that seems to unfold as it would in real life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other classics of realism are Emile Zola&rsquo;s <strong><em>Therese Raquin</em></strong>, 1873, August Strindberg&rsquo;s <strong><em>Miss Julie</em></strong>, 1888, Friedrich Durrenmatt&rsquo;s <strong><em>The Visit</em></strong>, 1956, and Maxim Gorky&rsquo;s <strong><em>Lower Depths</em></strong>, 1902, and <strong><em>Enemies</em></strong>, 1907.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plays of Chekhov were successfully staged by the Moscow Art Theater founded by Constantin Stanislavsky, who evolved a method of acting aimed at psychological realism. This method required the actor to keenly observe reality, hone the body as an instrument of expression, identify the character&rsquo;s principal &ldquo;spine&rdquo; as the basis for characterization, and develop &ldquo;emotion memory&rdquo; to recall a situation in one&rsquo;s life where the actor felt the emotion called for in a play&rsquo;s situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In the United States, realism began to develop from 1910 to 1920 through the &ldquo;little theater movement&rdquo; which was concerned with presenting plays with artistic excellence. In the decades that followed, realism developed in the hands of American playwrights, like Tennessee Williams, who wrote <strong><em>The Glass Menagerie</em></strong>, 1945, <strong><em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em></strong>, 1947, <strong><em>The Rose Tattoo</em></strong>, 1951, <strong><em>Summer and Smoke</em></strong>, 1952, <strong><em>Orpheus Descending</em></strong>, 1957, <strong><em>Suddenly Last Summer</em></strong>, 1959, and <strong><em>The Night of the Iguana</em></strong>, 1961; Arthur Miller who did <strong><em>All My Sons</em></strong>, 1947, <strong><em>Death of a Salesman</em></strong>, 1949, <strong><em>The Crucible</em></strong>, 1953, and <strong><em>A View from the Bridge</em></strong>, 1955; and Eugene O&rsquo;Neill who created <strong><em>Mourning Becomes Electra</em></strong>, 1931, and <strong><em>Long Day&rsquo;s Journey into Night</em></strong>, 1957.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1920s another type of realism developed in Russia called <strong>socialist realism</strong>, which referred to plays of the &ldquo;people&rsquo;s theater&rdquo; where forces opposed to the Russian Revolution of 1917 are presented as villains or where the lower classes are depicted in their abject poverty, exploited by landlords and capitalists. Under the influence of Vsevelod Meyerhold, socialist realism began to employ a nonrealistic production style to present social problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was only after World War II that the styles of modern theater were introduced in the Philippines through the Westernized educational system. Anglo-American culture was given emphasis in English classes, and dramas, such as those of realism, were studied in college as contemporary world classics. Moreover, some of the plays of realism reached even wider audiences when their movie versions were shown in Manila.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most playwrights and audiences encountered European or American realism through the translations and adaptations of these plays in local productions.

Tinio as <strong><em>Pahimakas sa Isang Ahente</em></strong> for the Ateneo de Manila in 1966 and directed by Joel Lamangan for Tanghalang Pilipino in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performed in English or Filipino, in translation or adaptation by school-based groups or by professional or semiprofessional theater companies, these plays of European and American realism became the models for the first one-act and full-length plays of realism written in the Philippines. Instrumental in the spread of these plays and in the writing and staging of the realistic plays by Filipinos are directors like Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero, Rolando S. Tinio, Antonio Mabesa, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2735\">Zeneida Amador</a>, Behn Cervantes, Nonon Padilla, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan Jr</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3251\">Jonas Sebastian</a>, Ricky Abad, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\">Chris Millado</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3322\">Soxie Topacio</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3048\">Maribel Legarda</a>. The styles of modern theater introduced from the West were adapted by Filipino modern playwrights and directors according to the needs of Philippine society and the temper of the times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realism has followed two tendencies in the country: the psychological, which focuses on the problems of individuals in themselves or in relation to other individuals; and the social, which situates individual problems within the larger framework of a class society in order to highlight urgent economic, political, or social issues in that society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays that painstakingly depict believable and well-rounded characters are first found among plays written in English by Filipinos in the 1940s and the 1950s, like Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/548\"><strong><em>The Forsaken House</em></strong></a>, 1940, which is about a family torn apart because of the conflict in the ways and values of parents and children; and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/677\"><strong><em>Three Rats</em></strong></a>, 1948, which tells of a woman&rsquo;s affair with her husband&rsquo;s best friend, and the subsequent murder of his friend by her husband. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3106\">Severino Montano</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/654\"><strong>Sabina</strong></a></em></strong>,1944, tells of the tragic fate of a young woman who fell in love with a traveling American trader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two plays by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a> employ the style of realism. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\"><strong><em>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</em></strong></a>, 1955, first directed by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4282\">Lamberto V. Avellana</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2769\">Barangay Theater Guild</a>, depicts the tragedy of two old-maid sisters in old Intramuros right before World War II, who refuse to accept the values of commercialism and pragmatism being propagated by the Americans and their Filipino followers, defending instead the Hispanic and genteel lifestyle of their father and their childhood even if they must live in poverty. <strong><em>Portrait</em></strong> &rsquo;s Filipino translation by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5794\">Alfred Yuson</a> and Franklin Osorio, titled <strong><em>Larawan</em></strong>, was directed by Lino Brocka for PETA in 1979; by Behn Cervantes for <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3338\">UP Repertory Company</a> in 1982; and by Nonon Padilla for Tanghalang Pilipino in 1989. <strong><em>Larawan</em></strong> was restaged by Tanghalang Pilipino in 1992 with a new translation by Bienvenido Lumbera, still under the direction of Padilla. <strong><em>Fathers and Sons</em></strong>, 1975, focuses on the conflict of generations&mdash;between the patriarch and his businessman son and between the latter and his own son who wants to be a priest. Its translation, <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/608\"><strong><em>Mga Ama</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mga <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong></em></strong></a>, was directed by Lino Brocka for PETA in 1976 and by Joel Lamangan for Tanghalang Pilipino in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After Guerrero, Montano, and Joaquin, younger playwrights ventured into writing plays that present the personal problems of typical Filipino individuals. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/642\"><strong><em>Paraisong Parisukat</em></strong></a> (Square Eden), 1974, written and directed by Orlando S. Nadres for PETA, shows how a simpleminded girl decides to bury her life and dreams of love and progress in the stuffy stockroom of a shoe store. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3127\">Bienvenido Noriega Jr</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/516\"><strong>Bayan-bayanan</strong></a></em></strong> (Little Country), 1975, first directed by Antonio Mabesa for Dulaang UP, and restaged by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2872\">Pio de Castro</a> in 1989 for Tanghalang Pilipino, exposes the personal dreams and frustrations of Filipino expatriates in Switzerland. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/558\"><strong><em>Hiblang Abo</em></strong></a> (Strands of Gray), 1980, first directed by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2923\">Tony Espejo</a> for <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2958\">Bulwagang Gantimpala</a>, depicts the loneliness and tragic end of four senior citizens in a home for the aged. Tony Perez&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/519\"><strong><em>Biyaheng Timog</em></strong></a> (Trip to the South), 1985, first directed by Nonon Padilla for Bulwagang Gantimpala, shows how an autocratic patriarch has destroyed the lives of his children, and how, after his death, his children finally become whole as persons. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5501\">Elsa Martinez-Coscolluela</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/564\"><strong><em>In My Father&rsquo;s House</em></strong></a>, 1987, directed by Antonio Mabesa for UP Playwrights Theater, depicts the slow deterioration of an upper middle-class family and its members who either reject or collaborate with the Japanese occupation of Negros Oriental in the early 1940s. Rody Vera&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/583\"><strong><em>Kung Paano Ko Pinatay si Diana Ross</em></strong></a> (How I Killed Diana Ross), 1991, is about a young man who represses his gay self by living like a regular macho and even marrying a girl, until his love for his best friend breaks down all pretensions and liberates the Diana Ross in him. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3175\">Nick Pichay</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tres Ataques de Corazon</em></strong>, 2005, depicts three characters from different classes and walks of life as they struggle with personal crises that lead to their heart attacks. Floy Quintos&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/544\"><strong><em>An Evening at the <strong>Opera</strong></em></strong></a>, 2011, reveals the destructive relationship between a cultured but feisty socialite and her boorish, corrupt, and womanizing politician of a husband, whom she married for convenience. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4689\">Auraeus Solito</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mga Buhay na Apoy</em></strong> (Living Flames), 2015, shows how a middle-aged woman finally comes to terms with her traumatic past and an ethnicity that she had tried to erase by living a normal middle-class life in the city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plays of social realism, on the other hand, present individuals caught in the issues and conflicts of society. One of the first plays about poverty, which ironically is written in English, is <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2943\">Alberto Florentino</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/690\"><strong><em>The World Is an Apple</em></strong></a>, 1954, first directed by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2724\">Nick Agudo</a> for Civic Theater, and later by Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero for the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3336\">UP Mobile Theater</a> tours. The play shows how a slum dweller is driven into crime in order to buy medicine for his sick child. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5696\">Rogelio Sicat</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/619\"><strong><em>Moses, Moses</em></strong></a>, 1968, was first directed by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2916\">Paul Dumol</a> in the 1970s at Ateneo, then performed at the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>, and restaged by Auraeus Solito for Tropa in 1990. The play portrays a family&rsquo;s struggle for justice. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2725\">Reuel Molina&nbsp;Aguila</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/563\"><strong><em>In Dis Korner</em></strong></a> (In This Corner), 1978, first directed by Anton Juan Jr for Dulaang UP, dramatizes an episode in the life of a professional boxer, who comes back to the ring to earn enough money to open a little store for his wife but turns his back on victory to buck the system of &ldquo;fixing,&rdquo; which exploits boxers like him. Chris Millado&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/526\"><strong><em>Buwan at Baril sa E-flat Major</em></strong></a> (Moon and Gun in E-flat Major), 1985, directed by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2840\">Apo Chua</a> for PETA, and for Tanghalang Pilipino in 1989, shows in five simple episodes the politicization of two brothers (a farmer and a worker) who meet during the Lakbayan march; a socialite dressing up to join a rally; an ethnic woman who reveals to a priest the abuses she suffered at the hands of the military; a student activist who gets caught by the military, is investigated, but outwits the military and manages to escape; and a teacher who has come to fetch the body of her NPA husband. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3007\">Malou Jacob</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/504\"><strong>Anatomiya ng Korupsyon</strong></a></em></strong> (Anatomy of Corruption), 1992, dramatizes how an idealistic young lawyer struggles to keep her integrity in a law office where corruption has become a way of life. <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2802\">Layeta Bucoy</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/540\"><strong>Doc Resureccion: Gagamutin ang Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (Doc Resureccion: Will Heal the Nation), 2009, is about a doctor who visits the slums where he came from to solicit his cousin&rsquo;s support in the coming elections, but instead is murdered in cold blood by his relatives for snubbing and neglecting the people he left behind in the slums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Realism is also used by many contemporary adaptations of stories first popularized in other media. Because the original novels were already written in that style, it was natural for Rody Vera and collaborating artists to adapt <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5405\">F. Sionil Jose</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mass</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Pretenders</em></strong> for the stage using the style of realism in 2005 and 2007, respectively. Similarly, movies made famous by Lino Brocka&mdash;namely, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1192\"><strong>Insiang</strong></a></em></strong>, 1976, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1127\"><strong>Bona</strong></a></em></strong>, 1980&mdash;were successfully adapted for the stage using a predominantly realistic style in 2002 and 2012, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the staging of these plays, realism is evident in one-unit sets such as the living room set in <strong><em><strong>Three Rats</strong></em></strong>; in costumes depicting a particular period, such as the 1940s clothes and hairstyles worn by the actors in <strong><em>In My Father&rsquo;s House</em></strong>; and in special effects, such as the snow seen falling outside a window in <strong><em>Bayan-bayanan</em></strong><em>.&nbsp;</em>In <strong><em><strong>In Dis Korner</strong></em></strong>,a boxing arena was used for the fight scenes but modified for other scenes as well. In <strong><em>Insiang</em></strong>, the wraparound set covered almost three walls of the CCP Tanghalang Huseng Batute with two-level slum dwellings and narrow passageways. This in-your-face set, together with the interminable movements of its lumpen characters and the strong expletives punctuating the colourful exchanges, captures so well the dog-eat-dog conditions that assault and devour the innocent Insiang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the 1950s, the spirit of realism and its method of scientific observation have enabled Filipino artists to grapple with the here and now. This has resulted in plays that now present a gallery of memorable Filipino characters painstakingly delineated&mdash;peasants, workers, sales clerks, social workers, street children, basketball stars, boxers, middle-class couples, impoverished gentry, war heroes, slum dwellers&mdash;and a compendium of stories that chronicle the Filipino&rsquo;s various reactions to the institutions and conditions of Philippine society. No doubt such plays have contributed greatly to the continuing definition of the Filipino identity. However, even as realism has been lauded for its insistence on what is, it has also been faulted for exactly the same reason, because many plays of realism confine and resign themselves to the immutable and less-than-ideal present, often negating hope in the future and the possibility of change.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

Considered the &#x201C;Father of Realism,&#x201D; however, is Norwegian dramatist Henrik Ibsen who staged <strong><em>The Pillars of Society</em></strong>, a problem play, in 1875. In this as in his <strong><em>A Doll&#x2019;s House</em></strong>, 1879, <strong><em>Ghosts</em></strong>, 1881, and <strong><em>An Enemy of the People</em></strong>, 1882, Ibsen unmasked society&#x2019;s code of &#x201C;morality&#x201D; whose hypocrisy destroys human beings. In <strong><em>The Wild Duck</em></strong>, 1884, <strong><em>Hedda Gabler</em></strong>, 1890, and <strong><em>The Master Builder</em></strong>, 1892, Ibsen concentrated on the psychology of particular individuals."

No doubt such plays have contributed greatly to the continuing definition of the Filipino identity.

		"text": "<p>The <strong>ritual</strong>, which may be called <strong>pag-aanito</strong> (literally, dealing with the anito or ancestral spirits) or <strong>pagdiwata</strong> (literally, dealing with the <strong>diwata</strong> or spirit), is the prototypal sacrifice in which a native shaman called <strong>mambunung</strong>, <strong>catalonan</strong>, <strong>bayok</strong>, babaylan, or <strong>balyan</strong> goes into a trance, possessed by the spirit the shaman is calling upon. While entranced, the shaman kills the sacrificial animal&mdash;usually a pig, chicken, or carabao&mdash;or pours water over the offerings of food, betel nut, wine, textiles, or jewelry. These rituals are believed to be the principal way by which mortals can communicate with the gods or spirits, who are perceived to have power over the economic, political, and social as well as physical and spiritual well-being of the tribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rituals, which are usually attended by dancing and chanting and accompanied by musical instruments, constitute the oldest form of theater in the Philippines because they contain the essence of theater&mdash; <strong>mimesis</strong>, or the imitation of action. Here, the sacrificial animal &ldquo;plays the role&rdquo; of the supplicant offering it, while the shaman stands for the spirit to whom the ritual is being offered. In full mimesis, therefore, the killing of the sacrificial animal represents the taking of the life of the supplicant by the spirit. In cases where food, betel nut, textiles, and jewelry are offered, the act of pouring water over these items by the shaman represents the consummation by the spirits of the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of these offerings.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>In indigenous Philippine societies, the basic ritual of sacrifice adapts itself to the different occasions for which it is held. Rituals may be offered in connection with the passage of tribal men and women through the stages of the life cycle&mdash;for example, to ensure the health of a newly born babe, to integrate a child into the community through the rite of baptism, to invite good fortune on the newly circumcised boy or to wish a young girl a good marriage after her first menstruation, to ask for prosperity and happiness for a newly married couple, and to lay the dead to everlasting rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An example of this life-cycle ritual is the Zambal ritual of baptism recorded by Father Perez in 1680. In this ritual, which is done in honor of the god Malyari, the shaman kills the animal prepared by the child&rsquo;s parents for the occasion. Then, amidst the chanting of all, the priest dresses the child in its best clothes, and unravels its long hair whose fringes the shaman ornaments with pieces of gold (thus wishing the child prosperity in life). The shaman then pours the blood of the sacrificial animal on the child (identifying the child with the animal), and then proceeds to cut the child&rsquo;s gold-embellished hair, to throw to an eager audience (thus reminding the child that individual prosperity must be shared with the tribe).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But rituals may also be held to bless or sanctify some of the most important economic, social, or political activities of the community&mdash;to cure the sick, to bless newly planted seedlings and to ensure a good harvest, to pray for or celebrate victory in war, to stop an epidemic or a plague, to identify a criminal, to consecrate a new shaman, or to elevate a new&nbsp;<em>datu&nbsp;</em>(chieftain).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good example of the rice-planting ritual is the <strong>kashawing</strong> of the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>, as described by Madale in 1974. In order to ensure a bountiful harvest, the Maranao hold a series of nine rituals, which reenact the pact made between the god of the seen (the ancestor of the Maranao) and his brother, the god of the unseen beings who reside in the waters of Lake Lanao. The Maranao believe that in the past, the god of the unseen promised to protect the harvest of his brother&rsquo;s descendants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this ritual, all Maranao farmers bring cooked rice, fish, and vegetables wrapped in banana leaves, and arrange these on a mat placed at the foot of the baletetree that stands at a certain distance from Lake Lanao. Beside the mat is a man who holds a pole with a red flag flying from it, symbolizing the Maranao. As soon as all are gathered, the farmers go on a procession led by an old man and the gong beater to the lake. Here, the old man wades into the water, calling on all the spirits of the lake to partake of their offering and to protect the crops of the Maranao, all the while waving a green-yellow flag to symbolize the invitation. After chanting his prayers, the old man then scoops water and some seaweed into a small can he has brought with him (the water symbolizes the spirits; the seaweed, their boats). The same man leads the procession of farmers back to the balete tree, with one man holding up on a pole a yellow flag symbolizing all the gods of the lake. Upon arrival at the tree, the pole of the yellow flag is stuck into the ground near the red flag, to signal the renewal of the pact. The old man pours out the water from the can on the offerings laid out on the mat. After the spirits have thus &ldquo;partaken&rdquo; of the offerings, the food is distributed and eaten reverently by the farmers. Thus is the pact ratified once more between the descendants of the seen and unseen gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many rituals continue to be performed today by cultural communities that have not been thoroughly Westernized, like the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2347\">Ifugao</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2355\">Kalinga</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2337\">Bontok</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2377\">Tinguian</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2344\">Ibaloy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2335\">Blaan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2361\">Mandaya</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2363\">Manobo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2378\">Tiruray</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2366\">Palawan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2374\">Tagbanwa</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a>, and other ethnic groups.

Among the Christianized groups, the rituals have assimilated Christian influences, especially in the replacement of ethnic gods with Christian saints, ethnic chants and movements with Christian prayers, music, and dances. Many scholars see this as proof that the ethnic precolonial culture has actually prevailed through the centuries, assimilating the foreign into the basic matrix of ethnicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A case in point is the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/34\"><strong>atang-atang</strong></a> &mdash;literally, &ldquo;offerings&rdquo; in Ibanag. This healing ritual of the Ibanag in Cagayan features a colorfully decorated small bamboo raft that contains offerings of rice, eggs, oil, cigarettes, rice cakes, and a little chick representing the soul of the sick person. Around this raft situated on the ground, two old women dance to the accompaniment of a <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">guitar</a>, drink, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/773\">chant</a> Christian prayers to cure the sick. Later, the women take oil from the raft and rub it on the face, legs, or hands of the sick person. Although it invokes the Christian God, this ritual is clearly in the tradition of the animistic pag-aanito.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some Christian communities, the ritual survives in almost symbolic form, but without losing its original motive and mimetic structure. For example, while the presentation of the Hispanic <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> in a rural town like Pe&ntilde;aranda, Nueva Ecija, is done in early May to honor the patron Santa Cruz (May 3 being the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross in the Christian liturgy), its essence as a precolonial ritual can still be discerned. The two-day performance on an elevated stage in front of the parish church of Pe&ntilde;aranda is also called <strong>arakyo</strong>, a kind of komedya that dramatizes the story of the finding of the true cross of Christ and how Reyna Elena and her son Haring Constantino had to fight the Moros to keep it. A very important part of the presentation, which is not even in the script, is the performance of popular folk songs and even contemporary songs by the ladies in the cast, at intervals. So frequent and so long are these interval dances that one begins to suspect that they are not just intermission numbers, especially the long free-for-all dancing session called the <strong>pantot</strong>, which happens toward the end of the komedya on the afternoon of the second day. For the pantot, it is not only the female <strong>komedyante</strong> who dance but the males as well, and they are joined on stage by the townsfolk, male and especially female, who dance carrying their babies and young children in their arms. If the womenfolk do not dance on stage, they ask the male and female komedyante to carry their babies and dance with them for the duration of the pantot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key to understanding the komedya performance as an ethnic ritual is the term &ldquo;pantot,&rdquo; which is a variation of the Tagalog word&nbsp;<em>pandot.&nbsp;</em>As described by the Franciscan friar Juan de Plasencia in 1589, the pandot is a &ldquo;festival&rdquo; or &ldquo;worship&rdquo; attended by the community in the chief&rsquo;s house, where the&nbsp;<em>catalonan&nbsp;</em>or shaman, after singing songs to the image of a native&nbsp;<em>anito&nbsp;</em>(spirit/god) and bedecking it in expensive cloths and jewelry, danced himself into a trance as the anito entered him. In his trance the shaman killed the sacrificial animal (goat, fowl, or pig), and distributed its parts to the community to be cooked and consumed. Such rituals, Plasencia noted, were held to ask the anito to heal the sick, bless a voyage, or ensure a good harvest, victory in war, a successful childbirth, and a happy married life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analyzed more closely, the parallelism between the spirit and structure of the pandot and those of the komedya/pantot becomes apparent. As the ethnic pandot was held by the Tagalog to ask a favor of the native anito, so the komedya and pantot are produced and performed as a solemn offering to the Christian image of the Holy Cross to ensure blessings (in many cases, identical to those mentioned by Plasencia) on Pe&ntilde;aranda town and its inhabitants. In the pandot, the supplicant is the one who is asking the anito for a favor; in the komedya and pantot it is the <strong>hermanos</strong> (sponsors) in the name of the community. The sacrificial pig would be the komedya itself, with the women and men dancing the pantot playing the role of the shaman presiding over the pantot. As the catalonan danced himself into a trance beside the sacrificial animal, so the women and men dance themselves into a frenzy on the stage of the komedya, side by side and with the komedyante who embody the sacrificial komedya. The three-way relationship between shaman, supplicant, and sacrifice has survived in the komedya/pantot for over four centuries, appropriating and prevailing over the foreign religion that tried its best to exterminate it. The komedya or arakyo, therefore, in spite of the foreign origins of its story and form, has remained as indigenous as the primordial pandot or pag-aanito originally enacted in the bosom of the indigenous Tagalog community.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

In his trance the shaman killed the sacrificial animal (goat, fowl, or pig), and distributed its parts to the community to be cooked and consumed. Such rituals, Plasencia noted, were held to ask the anito to heal the sick, bless a voyage, or ensure a good harvest, victory in war, a successful childbirth, and a happy married life."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Analyzed more closely, the parallelism between the spirit and structure of the pandot and those of the komedya/pantot becomes apparent. As the ethnic pandot was held by the Tagalog to ask a favor of the native anito, so the komedya and pantot are produced and performed as a solemn offering to the Christian image of the Holy Cross to ensure blessings (in many cases, identical to those mentioned by Plasencia) on Pe&#xF1;aranda town and its inhabitants. In the pandot, the supplicant is the one who is asking the anito for a favor; in the komedya and pantot it is the <strong>hermanos</strong> (sponsors) in the name of the community. The sacrificial pig would be the komedya itself, with the women and men dancing the pantot playing the role of the shaman presiding over the pantot. As the catalonan danced himself into a trance beside the sacrificial animal, so the women and men dance themselves into a frenzy on the stage of the komedya, side by side and with the komedyante who embody the sacrificial komedya. The three-way relationship between shaman, supplicant, and sacrifice has survived in the komedya/pantot for over four centuries, appropriating and prevailing over the foreign religion that tried its best to exterminate it. The komedya or arakyo, therefore, in spite of the foreign origins of its story and form, has remained as indigenous as the primordial pandot or pag-aanito originally enacted in the bosom of the indigenous Tagalog community.<span class>&#xA0;</span>"

Easily one of the most popular of all Lenten playlets, the salubong is also known as <strong>sabet</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, <strong>padafung</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a>, <strong>abet-abet</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2367\">Pangasinan</a>, <strong>pagsugat</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a>, <strong>sugat</strong> in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>, and <strong>encuentro</strong> or <strong>alleluya</strong> in many other Catholic and Aglipayan parishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At crack of dawn, two processions with their own <strong>karo</strong> or floats wind their separate ways around opposite parts of town&mdash;the first, that of the image of the Risen Christ; the second, that of the Mater Dolorosa veiled in black, usually preceded by the images of San Pedro, Maria Jacobe, Maria Salome, Maria Magdalena, and San Juan. At the appointed time, the two processions meet in front of a colorful four-posted structure of bamboo or cement called the <strong>galilea</strong>, from whose &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; (i.e., ceiling) hangs a huge inverted heart-shaped &ldquo;bud&rdquo; with four petals, sometimes called <strong>puso</strong> (heart). As the band plays, these petals are opened one at a time (usually by colorful wooden birds) to reveal a little child dressed as an angel. The Mater Dolorosa is brought directly under the angel, who is then lowered slowly, as she sings the Easter Sunday antiphon: &ldquo;Regina Coeli, laetare, alleluia, alleluia&rdquo; (Queen of Heaven, rejoice, alleluia, alleluia). At song&rsquo;s end, the little angel takes the Virgin&rsquo;s veil and removes it to signify that the Virgin&rsquo;s mourning has ended. Then, the angel is pulled back to &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; once more. Joyously, the two images then follow each other to the church, where Easter Sunday Mass is celebrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Many variations of the salubong are found in different regions. In many Tagalog towns of Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Quezon, and Marinduque, an important feature of the salubong is the <strong>bati</strong> or <strong>pagbati</strong> (greeting), which dramatizes the meeting of the Virgin and the Risen Christ (before the actual unveiling), through the lively dance of a young woman holding the flag of the Virgin and a young man holding the flag of the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) of Christ. In Angono, Rizal, which has one of the most elaborate salubong in the country, a <strong>tenienta</strong> (female lieutenant) dances waving a flag; then the <strong>capitana</strong> (female captain) declaimsa poem narrating the Resurrection of Christ, after which huge colorful birds swoop down on the galilea to open the inverted &ldquo;bud.&rdquo; In Bustillos, Sampaloc, a pigeon attached to a cluster of about 50 balloons clutches the Virgin&rsquo;s veil with its claws and flies off with it (with help from the balloons), even as hundreds of balloons around the area are released all together to the band&rsquo;s triumphant march. In Gasan, Marinduque, the Aglipayan salubong ends with a poem declaimed by a young woman to the Virgin, telling her to rejoice because Christ has risen from the dead, and to pray for the country so that its freedom may also rise from the dead. In Vigan, after the veil has been taken off by the angel, the inverted &ldquo;bud&rdquo; may open with a shower of roses and a flurry of pigeons&rsquo; wings. Also inVigan, the curtain between Christ and the Virgin is drawn away only after the veil has been taken off by the angel. In Santo Tomas, Pampanga, the salubong angel goes on procession after the salubong itself, carrying the Virgin&rsquo;s black veil around the town&rsquo;s streets, escorted by other little angels and preceded by 12 young ladies in colorful long gowns, who sing and dance to a violin&rsquo;s lilting melody at more than 20 designated stages around town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Minglanilla, Cebu, about seven to nine angels &ldquo;descend&rdquo; from the breast of what looks like a huge bird sitting on top of the galilea. Also in Minglanilla, before the unveiling, the effigy of Judas is burned as it hangs on a cable between the church tower and the galilea, while after the unveiling, the image of the Risen Christ (riding on a platform with an arch) is pulled up right through the galilea&rsquo;s ceiling and then &ldquo;ascends&rdquo; to heaven (the church tower) on a cable. In most towns, the principal angel is joined by a host of other <strong>angelitos</strong> strategically positioned in and around the galilea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Metro Manila, some cause-oriented theater groups have staged their own contemporized version of the salubong. In 1984, <strong><em><strong>Salubong</strong> sa Maynila</em></strong> (Meeting in Manila) was staged by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3166\">Peryante</a> on top of a truck at a rally in Liwasang Bonifacio. The all-woman cast led by Inangbayan as the Virgin Mary, wore long veils, &ldquo;weeping&rdquo; masks, and black T-shirts as they narrated the litany of the sufferings of the people. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kalbaryo ng Maralitang Tagalungsod</em></strong> (Calvary of the Urban Poor) has been performed by the urban poor on the streets of Manila on Good Friday from 1988 to 1992. It features several Christs who are accused of seven sins by the authorities. After carrying their crosses, they are &ldquo;crucified&rdquo; in front of Quiapo Church. On Black Saturday, the drama of the resurrection and the salubong are reenacted in a workers&rsquo; parish on Commonwealth Avenue in Quezon City.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

The saint worked during times of calamities and epidemics (especially cholera). Celebrated on Aug 16, these festivities may include a simple procession of the image of San Roque through the town streets, or a more elaborate procession of floats, depicting live tableaux of scenes from the life of San Roque, including, the birth of San Roque, his journey to Rome, his audience with the pope, and the lifting of his tunic so that the dog may lick his wounds. As San Roque&rsquo;s statues are found in almost all churches in the country, so the festivities in his honor were popular in many Christianized provinces at the turn of the century and up to the outbreak of World War II. With the rise of better sanitation and the emphasis on health practices, cholera epidemics became a thing of the past, relegating the devotion to San Roque to the background.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

This zarzuela was in one act and three&nbsp;<em>cuadros&nbsp;</em>(scenes), in prose and in verse, and was published in 1893.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The Spanish zarzuela that had come to the Philippines with Spanish actors in Spanish plays had thus moved to Filipino and Spanish actors in plays written in Spain, and then to Filipino and Spanish actors in plays written in the Philippines. The complete Filipinization of the form came when the sarsuwela unfolding the topics and concerns of Filipinos were written in Philippine languages. Among the first sarsuwela on record are <strong><em>Budhing Nagpahamak</em></strong> (Tragic Conscience), circa 1890, with libretto by an anonymous Bulacan playwright, and music by Isidoro Roxas; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3225\">Norberto Romualdez</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Pagtabang ni San Miguel</em></strong> (The Help of Saint Michael), a <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a> sarsuwela first staged at a town fiesta in Leyte in 1899; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3139\">Mariano Proceso Pabalan-Byron</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/597\"><strong><em>Ing Managpe</em></strong></a> (The Patcher), premiered at the Teatro Sabina in Bacolor, Pampanga, on 13 Sep 1900; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3146\">Catalino Palisoc</a>&rsquo;s antifriar <strong><em>Say Liman ag Naketket, Pampinsioan</em></strong> (The Hand That Cannot Be Bitten Must Be Kissed) in Pangasinan in 1897, but staged only in 1901 after the American insular government had been established; <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5707\">Vicente Sotto</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Maputi ug Maitum</em></strong> (Fair and Dark), a three-act play in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> written in 1902; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2859\">Valente Cristobal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/528\"><strong><em>Ang Capitan</em></strong></a> (The Captain) and <strong><em>Ang mga Viciohan</em></strong> (The Vice-Ridden), both first presented in Iloilo City in 1903; and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2856\">Mena Pecson Crisologo</a>&rsquo;s plays in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/530\"><strong><em>Codigo Municipal</em></strong></a> (Municipal Code) and <strong><em>Meysa a Candidato</em></strong> (There Was a Candidate), both dated 1908.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step in the indigenization of the zarzuela was thus the language, and the subject matter followed naturally, being the experience the language could encapsulate, as reality coming from its own cultural matrix&mdash;or perhaps the desire to present this reality&mdash;forced the use of the native language. The sarsuwela focused on Filipino situations, domestic and social: marriage and family, elections and feasts, vices and values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many were one-act plays, vignettes of Philippine life modeled on the Spanish <strong>genero chico</strong> (Spanish one-act zarzuela); but major works of two, three, four, and five acts eventually burgeoned in almost every region. They were written in the local language, generally by a member of the community, for specific drama groups and even for specific singers. Being so directly focused on a concrete and real audience and its consciousness, they came to be comedies of manners and, eventually, social documentation and history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the major Philippine sarsuwela are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong><em>Walang Sugat</em></strong></a> (Not Wounded), 1902, in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>, about lovers separated by the cruelty of friars and the revolution against Spain; and Mena Pecson Crisologo&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/620\"><strong><em>Natakneng a Panagsalisal</em></strong></a> (Noble Rivalry), circa 1911, in Ilocano, about a couple who fall in love after having been both bereaved during the Philippine-American War. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3269\">Juan Crisostomo Soto</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/501\"><strong><em>Alang Dios</em></strong></a> (There Is No God), 1902, staged in Pampanga, revolves around the story of a forced and abandoned marriage in a network of emotions and Filipino character types. Valente Cristobal&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/621\"><strong>Nating</strong></a></em></strong>,1908, has the central figure kidnapped by a band of men farming in the mountains, and the situation serving as a test for herself and her three suitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peak years for the sarsuwela were the 1920s, when it was not only staged at town fiestas in many provinces but also achieved a kind of professionalism. Troupes like Severino Reyes&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2973\">Gran Compa&ntilde;ia dela Zarzuela</a> Tagala and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3235\">Compa&ntilde;ia Ilagan</a>; stars like <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang&nbsp;dela Rama</a>, undisputed &ldquo;Queen of the Sarsuwela&rdquo;; plays like <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2888\">Servando delos Angeles</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/582\"><strong><em>Ang Kiri</em></strong></a> (The Flirt), 1926, with 700 performances, and Hermogenes Ilagan&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/535\"><strong><em>Dalagang Bukid</em></strong></a> (Country Maiden), 1919, with more than 1,000 performances (both with music by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4013\">Leon Ignacio</a>); audiences in theaters like the Zorrilla and in open-air makeshift stages in the provinces, singing sarsuwela songs&mdash;all proved that this regnant drama form had caught the popular imagination because it reflected lived life and taught the profitable lessons people expected of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Light but didactic as it was, it did not become real social satire, although some plays touched on, caricatured, explored, and even exposed such social ills as the corruption and false promises of politicians, and the often cruel treatment by landlords and bosses of tenants, employees, and servants. In the plays&rsquo; heroes (strong, loving, and loyal) and heroines (modest, obedient, and virtuous) were reflected deeply held community values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around the plays grew a world of theater, and a theater of conventions. At fiestas, they were paid for by the <strong>comite de festejos</strong> (fiesta committee) and offered free to the public. Outside of fiestas, they were organized by the <strong>samahang sarsuwelista</strong> (sarsuwela groups) or by individuals (often the playwright) who directed, financed, organized, and made some profit. Low though the fees were then, they represented professional status for the actors, who were rewarded as well with respect and social prestige.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Music was composed by untrained or barely trained church or folk musicians, as well as by schooled and accomplished composers like <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3849\">Nicanor Abelardo</a>. It was played by musicians and ensembles, ranging from single pianos or guitars, to orchestras of the size dictated by the group&rsquo;s or town&rsquo;s resources. According to <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4165\">Ramon Santos</a>, this localization of musical forms served as the beginnings of new musical genres such as the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/782\">kundiman</a>&nbsp;</em>(Tagalog love song). The backstage crew&mdash;the <strong>apuntador</strong> or prompter, the <strong>telonero</strong> who managed the painted backdrops, the director&mdash;came from the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The short period of the flowering of the sarsuwela did not give the form time to stretch its wings and develop with the changing times. Coming as it did at the junction of history when the Filipino emerged from his Spanish centuries and entered his American decades, the sarsuwela reflected in its inchoate realism, the reality of the transition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, even as the sarsuwela bowed out of the <strong>entablado</strong> (stage), it began to enjoy a new life on the silver screen. Capitalizing on the popularity of the sarsuwela, early film producers filmed sarsuwela hits like <strong><em>Dalagang Bukid</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ararong Ginto</em></strong> (Golden Plow), <strong><em><strong>Ang Kiri</strong></em></strong>,and <strong><em><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></em></strong>. At the same time, composers were commissioned by film producers to create songs for the filmed sarsuwela, which were later known as <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\">musicals</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contemporary times, new sarsuwela have been written: <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5197\">Isagani R. Cruz</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/555\"><strong>Halimaw</strong></a></em></strong> (Monster), 1971;<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\"> Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/525\"><strong><em>Ang Bundok</em></strong></a> (The Mountain) and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5435\">Domingo Landicho</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sumpang Mahal</em></strong> (Sacred Vow), both 1976; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G. Tiongson</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/644\"><strong><em>Pilipinas circa 1907</em></strong></a> (Philippines circa 1907), 1982; pop musicals like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5466\">Bienvenido Lumbera</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1416\"><strong>Bayani</strong></a></em></strong> (Hero), 1970, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/557\"><strong>Hibik at Himagsik nina Victoria Laktaw Atbp.</strong></a></em></strong> (Plea and Revolt of Victoria Laktaw and Others), 1998; and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4575\">Mario O&rsquo;Hara</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/639\"><strong>Palasyo ni Valentin</strong></a></em></strong> (Valentin&rsquo;s Palace), 1998. They show the viability of the form, and its continuing appeal to the Filipino audience. They also suggest ways of updating and revitalization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, the sarsuwela was brought back into the limelight by the College of Arts and Letters of the University of the Philippines Diliman through a monthlong Sarsuwela Festival with the theme &ldquo;Amor, Vida, Patria&rdquo; (Love, Life, and Nation). According to then dean <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5033\">Virgilio Almario</a>, the festival was an attempt to establish the sarsuwela as a Philippine national theater form. Opening with a grand parade, the festival brought to light the art form&rsquo;s contributions to Philippine history and culture through sarsuwela productions by various theater groups. The <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3333\">University of the East&nbsp;Drama Company</a> performed <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3147\">Precioso Palma</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/636\"><strong>Paglipas ng Dilim</strong></a></em></strong> (After the Darkness), 1920, with music by Leon Ignacio as directed by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2829\">Frederick Castro</a>. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2770\">Barasoain Kalinangan Foundation</a> staged their rendition of the classic <strong><em>Walang Sugat</em></strong> with music by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4198\">Fulgencio Tolentino</a>. The Far Eastern University&rsquo;s Art Theatre Clinique performed <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/650\"><strong>Sa Bunganga ng Pating</strong></a></em></strong> (At the Mercy of Sharks), 1921, directed by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3313\">Joey Ting</a> and with music by Leon Ignacio. The UP in the Visayas Alumni Theatre Company staged <strong><em>Ilo-Ilo Sarsuwela: Padayon ang Istorya</em></strong> (Ilo-Ilo Sarsuwela: The Story Continues), a sarsuwela directed by Alfredo Diaz, devised from five Visayan sarsuwelas: <strong><em>Dumut Cag Huya</em></strong> (Anger and Shame), 1912; <strong><em>Mga <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ni <strong><strong>Sisa</strong></strong></em></strong> (The Children ofSisa), 1926; <strong><em>Ma Pa Ta</em></strong> (Mother, Father, and Children), 1927; <strong><em>Sa Tiangge ni Takay</em></strong> (Takay&rsquo;s Small Store), 1928; and <strong><em>Pinustahan nga Gugma</em></strong> (The Game of Love), 2000. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang UP</a> closed the performances with their version of <strong><em>Ang Kiri</em></strong> under the direction of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3245\">Dexter Santos</a> with music by Leon Ignacio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Sarsuwela Festival also hosted a conference whose papers discussed the history, production, and theories behind the sarsuwela. Some of the papers were later published in one volume of the <strong><em>Philippine Humanities Review</em></strong>. Similarly, a sarsuwela writing contest yielded one honorable mention entry, <strong><em>Ang Se&ntilde;orita at ang Hukbo</em></strong> (The Lady and the Soldier) by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a> with music by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3051\">Lucien Letaba</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.

		"text": "<p><strong><strong>Sinakulo</strong></strong> or <strong>senakulo</strong>, from Spanish&nbsp;<em>cenaculo</em>, meaning &ldquo;cenacle&rdquo; or &ldquo;supper room,&rdquo; is a play presented during the Lenten season and especially during Holy Week, which dramatizes the history of salvation&mdash;from the creation of the world, Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel, to the life and passion, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Probably begun in the 18th century and already popular by the 19th century, the passion play is known by many names and versions: as sinakulo or <strong>pasion y muerte</strong>, from Spanish &ldquo;passion and death,&rdquo; in Rizal, Bulacan, Pampanga, and Pangasinan; as <strong>kalbaryuhan</strong>, from <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> &ldquo;play on Calvary,&rdquo; in Marinduque; as <strong>centurion</strong>, from Spanish centurion, and <strong>hudyo-hudyuhan</strong>, from Tagalog &ldquo;playing at Jews,&rdquo; in Paete, Laguna; as <strong>tanggal</strong>, from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> &ldquo;deposition,&rdquo; in Camarines Sur; as <strong>taltal</strong> or <strong>pagtaltal</strong> from <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2349\">Ilonggo</a> &ldquo;crucifixion,&rdquo; in Guimaras and Negros Occidental; and as <strong>senakulo</strong> in Leyte.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting out as a dramatization of the 1814 <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g&nbsp;<strong>Genesis</strong></em></strong></a>, which starts with the creation of the world and ends with the search for the cross by Elena and Constantino, the contemporary sinakulo <strong>orihinal</strong> or script has added lines and scenes from other&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1558\">pasyon</a>&nbsp;</em>(e.g., the <strong><em>Pasyong Candaba</em></strong> and <strong><em>Pasyong Truncalis</em></strong>); from the New Testament; from religious novels like <strong><em>El Martir del Golgotha</em></strong> by Enrique Perez Escrich (translated into Tagalog by Juan Evangelista); from the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido&nbsp;</em>or metrical tales (e.g., the <strong><em><strong>Tatlong Hari</strong>ng Magos</em></strong>, <strong><em>Sagrada Familia</em></strong>,and <strong><em>Quince Misterios</em></strong> );from the religious playlets (e.g., the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a>); from popular magazines (e.g., the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong><em>Liwayway</em></strong></a>); from movies (e.g., <strong><em>The Ten Commandments</em></strong>, 1956, <strong><em>The Robe</em></strong>, 1953, and <strong><em>Quo Vadis</em></strong>, 1951); and other sinakulo. Sometimes an <strong>awtor</strong> (author) may create his own scenes, characters, and dialogue.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The sinakulo is presented any time from Ash Wednesday to Easter Sunday, either on different nights in different <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>teatro</strong></a> (theaters) by commercial troupes, or on Holy Week by barrio-based <strong>samahan</strong> (organizations) in front of the barrio chapel (sometimes the latter may also be contracted commercially for performances outside their barrio). Shorter scenes of the sinakulomay also be presented on the streets of the barrio on Holy Thursday, like the centurion of Paete, Laguna; or on Good Friday, like the grand <strong>penitensiya</strong> of Cainta, Rizal, the <strong>pagdakip</strong> of Malolos, Bulacan, and the senakulo of Cutud, San Fernando, Pampanga, where devotees playing Christ are crucified with real nails.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <strong>entablado</strong> or stage of the sinakulo is usually a rectangular platform about five feet high and made of wooden planks or of cement, generally divided by a permanent backdrop and bamboo frame into the acting area in front and the dressing area at the back.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Entablado posts support a row of bamboo/wooden frames from which are hung the various <strong>telon</strong> or backdrops. Samples of these telones are the <strong>telon de boca</strong> or front curtain, which masks scene changes; the <strong>telon de fondo</strong>,which separates the dressing from the acting area and is usually painted with clouds and angels; the <strong>telon natural</strong>,often painted with a typical tropical landscape with trees, fields, and mountains for scenes of travel; the <strong>telon palacio</strong>, usually showing the interior of a palace for scenes of Annas, Caiphas, Herod, and Pilate; and the <strong>telon bundok</strong>, depicting mountain peaks for scenes of Christ&rsquo;s recollection, transfiguration, and crucifixion. <strong>Bastidor</strong> or flats are hung or stood on either side of the stage to mask lateral exits and entrances, while <strong>bambalina</strong> or short curtains hang from the ceiling to conceal the lights and rolled-up telon<em>.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Props are often functional but anachronistic, like&nbsp;<em>pansit&nbsp;</em>(noodles) on plastic plates and Coca-Cola in bottles for the Last Supper, a plastic basin for the washing of the feet, and a&nbsp;<em>papag&nbsp;</em>(bamboo bed) for the Virgin&rsquo;sdeath. Most sinakulo are now lighted by naked electric bulbs orby sophisticated, computerized lighting gadgets, while microphones&mdash;hanging, standing, or lapel&mdash;are used in town and country. The <strong>direktor</strong> are the unquestioned masters of the sinakulo. They teach young and old alike how to chant the <strong>punto</strong> or chanted melody proper to a character, how to deliver their lines in the correct <strong>dicho</strong>,how to make the various <strong>mustra</strong> or gestures and <strong>aksiyon</strong> or actions. They keep the <strong>orihinal</strong> (script) and, as <strong>apuntador</strong> or prompters during performances, feed each line to all the characters; blow the whistle to signify to the band of&nbsp;<em>musikero&nbsp;</em>what kind of march (slow <strong>punebre</strong> or fast <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>paso doble</strong></a>) to play for exits and entrances; liaise with sponsors and barrio leaders who support the sinakulo; act as chief counselor for all problems&mdash;personal or professional; and pull together the work of the persons in charge of the backdrops, the props, the band, and all other assistants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Actors who act for commercial troupes are paid per performance, while those who act for the barrio do so in fulfillment of a <strong>panata</strong> or holy vow. Acting styles of the sinakulo are of two types: the style for the Kristo and the <strong>banal</strong> (the holy ones), who march to slow punebre beat, chant their lines in lamenting fashion, and move their hands and headswith meekness and humility; and the style for the <strong>hudyo</strong> (Jews), who swagger to the paso doble beat, sing ordeliver lines snappily, and act proud and fierce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, sinakulo characters are costumed like the images of Lenten processions: Christ in maroon velvet with gold embroidery, wearing white lace around His neck and wrists, a brunette wig, and three tin rays called <strong>potensiya</strong>;the Virgin in a blue and purple gown with a white or purple veil tucked under a <strong>rostrillo</strong> (thin rays around her face), and the heart with seven daggers traced in sequins on her breast; San Juan in red and green; San Pedro in green and yellow; Magdalene in purple and yellow; and Veronica in blue and white. Characters without corresponding images in church may be dressed by the folk imagination, thus Claudia, Herod&rsquo;s wife, in the Philippine Carnival Queen&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em>terno&nbsp;</em>with train, collar, and crown; Barabbas in knee-length pants, a T-shirt, and&nbsp;<em>balanggot&nbsp;</em>(farmer&rsquo;s hat); and Roman soldiers in knee-length&nbsp;<em>salawal&nbsp;</em>(pants) and puff-sleeved, waisted shirts, with Viking headgear and Roman helmets as seen in various movies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Important for all sinakulo are the <strong>artipisyo</strong> (artifices), which create special effects like galaxies of stars, suns, and moons that come in and out of the stage on a mechanism of strings and pulleys at the Creation of the World; special fireworks for the Resurrection; and machines to raise the Virgin up to heaven for the scene of the Assumption.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The staging of the sinakulo may be as basic as the kalbaryuhan, the Marinduque dramatization of the pasyon, which is as basic as it is charming (e.g., to portray the Three Kings, three old men in civilian clothes don farmer&rsquo;s hats garlanded with bougainvillea blooms) or as technically sophisticated as the sinakulo of Cainta, Rizal, which has hundreds of spots and dimmers, boulders that roll aside to reveal the resurrected Christ, and a heavenly sky studded with the cherubic heads of real children on wings that actually flap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In recent years, the shortened sinakulo of Barrio Cutud in San Fernando, Pampanga, has attracted hordes of local and foreign tourists. Here, on Good Friday, devotees fulfill their <strong>panata</strong> or vow to undergo physical suffering to ask God for personal favors or to thank him for blessings received. The ritual begins with devotees flagellating themselves and then carrying the cross, and culminates in the reenactment of the crucifixion, where the devotee playing Christ is stripped of his robe down to a piece of cloth that hides his nakedness and laid on the cross on which he is nailed with actual long construction nails. Then the cross and devotee are raised to stand from the ground for all to see for a few minutes, after which other devotees may also have themselves nailed to the cross in fulfillment of their own vows (Tiatco 2006). This type of crucifixion of devotees in fulfillment of religious vows has been practiced for many decades in Kapitangan, Paombong, Bulacan, where both male and female Christs are literally nailed to the cross on Good Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the full-length sinakulo survives in towns and places where the community or community organizations have taken over the play and supported it with generous funding. It has disappeared, however, in many other places, either because industrialization has turned farmers into workers who now no longer have time for the sinakulo, or because modernization and mass media have successfully robbed the sinakulo of its avid audiences and participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the traditional sinakulo dramatizes the struggle of good and evil and the final triumph of the good, so the modern sinakulo now dramatizes the struggle between classes and sectors in Philippine society. Earliest of the modern passion plays is <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio V. Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/510\"><strong><em>Bagong Cristo</em></strong></a> (New Christ), 1907, a &ldquo;<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> socialista&rdquo; (socialist drama) that portrays Christ as the labor leader organizing city and countryside workers to demand better wages from factory owners and landlords. In 1977, Christ was likewise interpreted by the <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2761\">Dulaang Babaylan</a> <strong><em>Sinakulo</em></strong> as a farmer whose cross is the plow and whose oppressors are landlords and capitalists (the modern Annas, Caiaphas, and Herod). In 1983, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5785\">Virgilio Vitug</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sinakulo Ning Balen</em></strong> (Passion Play of the Country), presented in Lubao, Pampanga, exposed fiscals who can be bribed to dismiss capital crimes, fake overseas recruiters who victimize helpless peasants, and candle sellers who commercialize religion. Here Jesus Macabalen dies, but his struggle for justice is carried on by teachers, workers, farmers, and the ethnic minorities. In 1988, an organization of the urban poor in Manila produced <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kalbaryo ng Maralitang Tagalungsod</em></strong> (Calvary of the Urban Poor), and staged its first scene on Smokey Mountain and then marched to Mendiola, where the 13 Christs (representing 13 organizations of the urban poor) wearing huge masks inspired by the face of the Quiapo Nazareno were accused of seven sins/infractions of urban law by the three Pilates who represent the establishment. After the Christs were condemned to carry the cross, the procession, which also featured seven huge murals interpreting Christ&rsquo;s Seven Last Words according to contemporary social realities, moved on to Quiapo where the crucifixion was held. To this day, the passion of Christ continues to be interpreted by many progressive groups according to the social issues and concerns of the times.&nbsp;<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

The ritual begins with devotees flagellating themselves and then carrying the cross, and culminates in the reenactment of the crucifixion, where the devotee playing Christ is stripped of his robe down to a piece of cloth that hides his nakedness and laid on the cross on which he is nailed with actual long construction nails. Then the cross and devotee are raised to stand from the ground for all to see for a few minutes, after which other devotees may also have themselves nailed to the cross in fulfillment of their own vows (Tiatco 2006).

Tolentino</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/7/58/510\"><strong><em>Bagong Cristo</em></strong></a> (New Christ), 1907, a &#x201C;<a href=\"/7/55/449\">drama</a> socialista&#x201D; (socialist drama) that portrays Christ as the labor leader organizing city and countryside workers to demand better wages from factory owners and landlords. In 1977, Christ was likewise interpreted by the <a href=\"/7/7/2761\">Dulaang Babaylan</a> <strong><em>Sinakulo</em></strong> as a farmer whose cross is the plow and whose oppressors are landlords and capitalists (the modern Annas, Caiaphas, and Herod). In 1983, <a href=\"/9/9/5785\">Virgilio Vitug</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Sinakulo Ning Balen</em></strong> (Passion Play of the Country), presented in Lubao, Pampanga, exposed fiscals who can be bribed to dismiss capital crimes, fake overseas recruiters who victimize helpless peasants, and candle sellers who commercialize religion. Here Jesus Macabalen dies, but his struggle for justice is carried on by teachers, workers, farmers, and the ethnic minorities. In 1988, an organization of the urban poor in Manila produced <a href=\"/7/60/3243\">Al Santos</a>&#x2019;s <strong><em>Kalbaryo ng Maralitang Tagalungsod</em></strong> (Calvary of the Urban Poor), and staged its first scene on Smokey Mountain and then marched to Mendiola, where the 13 Christs (representing 13 organizations of the urban poor) wearing huge masks inspired by the face of the Quiapo Nazareno were accused of seven sins/infractions of urban law by the three Pilates who represent the establishment. After the Christs were condemned to carry the cross, the procession, which also featured seven huge murals interpreting Christ&#x2019;s Seven Last Words according to contemporary social realities, moved on to Quiapo where the crucifixion was held. To this day, the passion of Christ continues to be interpreted by many progressive groups according to the social issues and concerns of the times.&#xA0;<span class>&#xA0;</span>"

		"text": "<p><strong>Stand-up comedy</strong> is a theater form that features a comedian, also called a <strong>comic</strong>, <strong>stand-up comic</strong>, <strong>stand-up comedian</strong>, or simply <strong>stand-up</strong>, performing in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. Usually called a <strong>monologue</strong>, <strong>routine</strong>, or <strong>act</strong>, the material presented is composed of humorous stories, jokes, and one-liners. Stand-up comedy is commonly performed in comedy clubs, bars, and small theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stand-up comedy is one of the legacies of the American occupation of the Philippines. After the Philippine-American War, along with the establishment of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, came the unimpeded Americanization of the Philippines, which included the onslaught of the teaching Thomasites, English as the medium of instruction, and the invasion of American commercial culture. Rather swiftly, vaudeville, later known as <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> or stage show, replaced the traditional Filipino <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> as the primary form of live theater in the islands and became the much-welcomed jazzed up entertainment for the elite and the masses.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>American-type bodabil acts were first performed by visiting troupes in sarsuwela venues such as the famous <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a>. During the beginnings of the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\">Jazz</a> Age&rdquo; from 1920 to 1929, a Filipino entertainer named Luis Borromeo returned from North America in 1921, renamed himself &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3911\">Borromeo Lou</a>,&rdquo; dubbed the emerging theater form &ldquo;vod-a-vil&rdquo; (later Filipinized into &ldquo;bodabil&rdquo;) and, subsequently, organized what became the first Filipino bodabil company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The popularity of bodabil was not confined to Manila stages; it also kept the audiences entertained in fiestas and carnivals with stage show routines: musical numbers (songs and social dances), acrobatic acts, dramatic sketches, magic acts, and, very likely, the comic monologist/humorist or duo&mdash;the precursor of the modern stand-up comedian. The Filipinos were quick to appropriate the variety show elements of bodabil, including the American theater circuit system of having live performances in between the screening of films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the years, in contemporary variety format incarnations, live shows inevitably highlighted the bodabil quick-hit and interactive crowd-pleaser in modern dress: the stand-up comedian/host, a curious mix of part-bodabil monologist, and part burlesque emcee. The stand-up/comic monologue was a new performing art showcasing a solo comedian who, without props or costuming, and using only his wit, his mouth, and his worldview, directly addressed an audience and attempted to make them laugh. In a sense, it was a comic solo; a verbal &ldquo;tightrope act&rdquo; where, in showbiz parlance, the inevitable outcome for the comedian is to either &ldquo;kill&rdquo; (become a hit) or &ldquo;bomb&rdquo; (fail, or &ldquo;die&rdquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filipinos lapped up the new form and mirrored the Americans&rsquo; penchant for satire, applauding the unique point of view and comedic flair, especially in not-so-subtle digs at everything political or social through seemingly off-the-cuff casual humor. To this day, traveling comedians in the Philippines performing in town fiestas on makeshift stage platforms, town halls, and even cockpits echo comedy routines that can be traced in one form or another to turn-of-the century bodabil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The burlesque mold triumphed with stand-up comedians, and singer-comedians (who offered a double treat) were expected to keep the crowds entertained and cackling, from the time of the Japanese occupation in 1941-45 to the disco decade of the 1970s&mdash;from <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4609\">Pugo and Togo</a> to <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4414\">Dolphy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4333\">Chiquito</a> to <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4896\">Bert Marcelo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4266\">Apeng Daldal</a> to Babalu, <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4784\">Chichay</a> to <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4210\">Mitch Valdes</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4928\">Pepe Pimentel</a> to <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4134\">Rico Puno</a>.

After the Philippine-American War, along with the establishment of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, came the unimpeded Americanization of the Philippines, which included the onslaught of the teaching Thomasites, English as the medium of instruction, and the invasion of American commercial culture. Rather swiftly, vaudeville, later known as <a href=\"/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a> or stage show, replaced the traditional Filipino <a href=\"/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> as the primary form of live theater in the islands and became the much-welcomed jazzed up entertainment for the elite and the masses."

During the beginnings of the &#x201C;<a href=\"/5/35/779\">Jazz</a> Age&#x201D; from 1920 to 1929, a Filipino entertainer named Luis Borromeo returned from North America in 1921, renamed himself &#x201C;<a href=\"/5/5/3911\">Borromeo Lou</a>,&#x201D; dubbed the emerging theater form &#x201C;vod-a-vil&#x201D; (later Filipinized into &#x201C;bodabil&#x201D;) and, subsequently, organized what became the first Filipino bodabil company."

The Filipinos were quick to appropriate the variety show elements of bodabil, including the American theater circuit system of having live performances in between the screening of films."

				"value": "Through the years, in contemporary variety format incarnations, live shows inevitably highlighted the bodabil quick-hit and interactive crowd-pleaser in modern dress: the stand-up comedian/host, a curious mix of part-bodabil monologist, and part burlesque emcee. The stand-up/comic monologue was a new performing art showcasing a solo comedian who, without props or costuming, and using only his wit, his mouth, and his worldview, directly addressed an audience and attempted to make them laugh. In a sense, it was a comic solo; a verbal &#x201C;tightrope act&#x201D; where, in showbiz parlance, the inevitable outcome for the comedian is to either &#x201C;kill&#x201D; (become a hit) or &#x201C;bomb&#x201D; (fail, or &#x201C;die&#x201D;)."

To this day, traveling comedians in the Philippines performing in town fiestas on makeshift stage platforms, town halls, and even cockpits echo comedy routines that can be traced in one form or another to turn-of-the century bodabil."

		"text": "<p><strong>Street theater</strong> refers to theater performed mainly on the streets or in open air and outside the theater structure or building, and without the <strong>entablado</strong> or elevated stage area. Ethnic <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, songs, and dances enacted in backyards, riverbanks, and rice fields, and the Spanish-influenced religious plays performed in the streets may be considered as street theater, as well as the political theater performed in the street from the late 1960s to the 2010s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Open-Air Indigenous Performances.</strong> Rituals, through the centuries and to the present, have been performed for various purposes, such as healing the sick, a good harvest, hunting, and rites of passage. These rituals, usually led by the babaylan, also called <strong>baylan</strong> or shaman, and participated in by the community, are performed in backyards, open fields, riverbanks, and seashores. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/34\"><strong>atang-atang</strong></a> healing ritual of Isabela performed near a river, two women dance around a small raft filled with offerings. The raft is then set afloat. To give thanks for a bountiful harvest, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2339\">Bukidnon</a> groups perform the <strong>hinaklaran</strong>, erecting a shelf of bamboo and <strong>dongla</strong> in an open field. The shelf is laden with offerings of betel nut, rice wine, cakes, candles, and red cloth pleasing to the gods.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">Mimetic dances</a>, considered as proto-dramas, may depict important tribal activities, imitate the movements of animals, or dramatize episodes from the epic of the tribe. Among the Badjao, the <strong>silat</strong> (also called by this name along with <strong>kuntao</strong>, <strong>lima</strong>, and <strong>pansak</strong> among the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2375\">Tausug</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2370\">Sama</a>), which enacts fierce fights, is performed out at sea on a boat or by the seashore. In a dance of the Camarines <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2327\">Aeta</a>, a woman goes to a stream to &ldquo;dig&rdquo; and gather&nbsp;<em>gabi&nbsp;</em>(taro), represented by round stones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hispanic Plays on the Streets.</strong> During the Spanish colonial period, religious plays were introduced, performed mainly during the Christmas and Lenten seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The search for an inn by Mary and Joseph is reenacted in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\"><strong>panunuluyan</strong></a>, done on the town&rsquo;s streets during Christmas Eve. It has many versions: the scene may be played by two singers; the singers and a brass band may accompany the images of the saints on top of two <strong>karo</strong> or floats, as in Malolos, Bulacan; or the actors may ride on floats, accompanied by 13 other floats featuring characters from the Bible, as in the Kawit <strong>maytinis</strong>. Leaving the church at around seven in the evening, the procession goes to about three or more houses in different parts of the barrio, where the performers stop to sing a mournful plea. Shortly before midnight Mass, the couple returns to the church where they ascend the stairs to a Bethlehem scene on the altar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/465\"><strong>pastores</strong></a>, which dramatizes the shepherds&rsquo; adoration of the Infant Jesus, used to be performed during Christmas on stage or the church patio in Cavite and Bulacan. It is performed today in Bicol by &ldquo;shepherdesses&rdquo; dancing and singing Spanish <strong>villancicos</strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> carols on the street in front of different houses.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The entry of Christ into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday, reenacted in the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a>, is performed in most Catholic and Aglipayan parishes in the country. The ritual begins inside the church, where the priest blesses the palm fronds. The priest then leads the procession of the &ldquo;apostles&rdquo; through the streets into the patio where a <strong>kubol</strong>, an elevated wooden balcony, stands on each corner. Young girls in white sing while showering flower petals on the priest as he walks to each kubol. The procession then goes back to the church where the priest has to rap on the closed door three times before all can enter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/483\"><strong>via crucis</strong></a> held during the seven days of Lent, the candle procession starts from the church at about five or six in the afternoon and proceeds to the church patio or the town&rsquo;s main streets. The procession winds through the streets of the town, stopping at each of the 14 <strong>estasyon</strong> (Stations of the Cross) for prayers and a brief reflection. The procession then goes back to the church after about three hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The loneliness of the Virgin Mary after she buries her son, Jesus, is depicted in the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>soledad</strong></a>. The image of the Mater Dolorosa (Sorrowful Mother) comes out of the church after the Good Friday procession of the Santo Entierro, and goes around the streets of the town, accompanied by images of San Pedro, Maria, Jacobe, Maria Salome, Maria Magdalena, and San Juan. The Virgin&rsquo;s karo stops in front of designated houses, where young women sing to her from a window or a balcony.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a>, which dramatizes the meeting of the Mater Dolorosa and the Risen Christ, two processions start from opposite ends of town at the crack of dawn on Easter Sunday. The two processions wind through the streets on opposite sides of town, then meet outside the church in a space called <strong>galilea</strong>, a colorful four-posted structure of bamboo and cement in the open air. Here, the <strong>sayaw ng pagbati</strong> (dance of greeting) is performed before the <strong>aleluya</strong> (singing of angels). It is a celebratory ritual dance where dancers wave flags for the Virgin Mary, to transform the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s <strong>lumbay</strong> (sorrow) to <strong>galak</strong> (joy)<em>.</em>There are many <strong>bati</strong> (greeting) versions danced in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/459\"><strong>moriones</strong></a>, a playlet about the beheading of the Roman soldier and first Christian martyr Longhino, is performed in the towns of Boac, Gasan, Mogpog, and Santa Cruz in Marinduque during Good Friday. The traditional <strong>pugutan</strong> (beheading) featured the search for Longhino through the town&rsquo;s streets, up coconut trees, and on the seashore. However, a stage and its adjacent grounds has been used since the 1970s when the playlet was replaced by a longer scripted play, although the chase of Longhino is still performed on the streets of the town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, staged during the Holy Week, dramatizes the life and sufferings of Jesus Christ. Today, it continues to be performed by the barrio-based <strong>samahan</strong> or organization in front of the barrio chapel in the open air, while short scenes of the sinakulo may also be presented on the streets of the barrio like the <strong>centurion</strong> of Paete, Laguna, performed during Holy Thursday; the <strong>grand penitensiya</strong> of Cainta, Rizal, performed on Good Friday; and the <strong>pagdakip</strong> of Malolos, Bulacan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/458\"><strong>moros y cristianos</strong></a>, which depicts the battle between the Moros (Moors) and Cristianos (Christians) with dialogue and dances on the streets or in the open field, has many names and variations, among them: <strong>moro-moro</strong> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a>; <strong>sayaw</strong> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2330\">Aklanon</a>; <strong>bakahan</strong>, also in Tagalog; <strong>mardikas</strong> in Ternate&ntilde;o; <strong>palo-palo</strong> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2353\">Ivatan</a>; <strong>sambali</strong> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2345\">Ibanag</a>; <strong>sinulog</strong> in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2379\">Waray</a>; and <strong>kinabayo</strong> in Dapitan <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>. In Ibajay, Aklan, the moro-moro or sayaw is performed in the morning of the third Sunday of January in honor of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o. The dance is performed by the warring factions starting from opposite ends of a half kilometer long street, marching toward each other and back while exchanging lines, and finally moving toward the altar of the Santo Ni&ntilde;o in front of the church. The kinabayo performed in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte, dramatizes the Battle of Covadonga, said to have occurred in 718 AD between the Christian general Pelayo and the Moro Alkamah. The battle, enacted on the 24th of July, has since changed venues through the years: from the streets, as part of the morning procession; to a bamboo stage in the church patio, when revised in 1952; and finally, to the grounds of the provincial high school in the 1980s. The bakahan, of San Antonio, Kalayaan, Laguna, is performed by boys dressed in mask-headdresses, capes, bands, and swords. Dramatizing the sword fight between San Miguel Arcangel and the <strong>hudyo</strong> or Jews, it is performed in the churchyard from 2:00 to 3:00 pm on Good Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Bicol, a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\">komedya</a> performance in the form of pilgrimage is also enacted on the street. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/448\"><strong>dotoc</strong></a> is a religious devotion to the Holy Cross. Every year in April and May, communities in the Bicol region of the Philippines perform the dotoc for nine days. The performance involves the singing of a text by women cantors called <strong>paradotoc</strong>, who, as pilgrims, journey to the Holy Land to visit the Holy Cross. The text has various forms with varying narratives and manner of performance. Dotoc is an archaic <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> word for pilgrimage&mdash;an action of the komedya to find the Cross of Jesus undertaken by Elena when she was already 80 years old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although rituals and mimetic dances continued to be performed in the ethnic communities, and the religious playlets remained popular in many towns throughout the Philippines, the term &ldquo;theater&rdquo; became associated more and more with plays performed within the theater structure. The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a>, introduced during the Spanish colonial period, retained their popularity during the first three decades of the 20th century. American colonial rule introduced the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>, or <strong>stage show</strong>, and the one-act play in English. After World War II, playwrights and directors developed works in the styles of modern theater, employing <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\">realism</a> and expressionism in their plays. No longer sustained by the community, play productions depended on a producer for financing. Since production costs had to be recovered, the theater structure became necessary to ensure a paying audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><strong>Street Theater</strong> as Political Protest.</strong> A new kind of street theater, later called <strong>dulansangan</strong>, flourished in the period of activism between 1970 and 1972, and the escalating mass movement in the 1980s preceding the 1986 fall of Marcos. Street theater draws its material from the experiences of the streets, and is presented outside of theater structures, both indoors (churches, building lobbies, marketplaces) and outdoors (plazas, roads, assembly points for rallies). The term thus refers to issue-oriented plays performed during pickets, rallies, symposia, strikes, demonstrations, and marches, where people are brought together by their unity on issues and problems confronting Philippine society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National, sectoral, and specific issues supplied the themes generally carried in the plays. To present these issues, various theater forms and styles have been used by the theater groups in the 1980s until the present: <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/481\"><strong>tula-dula</strong></a>, <strong>choral recitation</strong>, <strong>bodabil</strong>, <strong>improvisation</strong>, <strong>pantomime</strong>, the <strong>effigy-lantern play</strong>, the <strong>radio play</strong>, the <strong>allegorical play</strong>, <strong>kilos-awit</strong> (movement-song), <strong>kilos-sayaw</strong> (ranging from banner dance to the indigenous war dance <strong>kuntao</strong>), <strong>newspaper theater</strong>, traditional forms such as <strong>salubong</strong> and sinakulo, and forms introduced in Augusto Boal&rsquo;s theater of the oppressed, such as image and forum theaters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Costumes usually consisted of a white T-shirt and denims. To suggest character, a military cap could be added to signify an officer, a towel around the neck to identify a worker, a straw hat to portray a peasant, or books to indicate students. Masks served to show character, to make actors seem larger onstage, and to hide the faces of actors evading arrest. Props and sets were usually convertible: a hula-hoop becoming a magnifying glass, a box a chair, a platform a mountain, placards together a mural. Pantomime, the use of a narrator, songs, dances, comedy, and satire were also used. Brecht&rsquo;s epictheater and the Cultural Revolution plays of China have also influenced political theater performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plays of the First Quarter Storm in 1970, performed during rallies, demonstrations, and marches at venues such as Plaza Miranda, Mendiola, Liwasang Bonifacio, and numerous school grounds and factories, depicted the plight of the workers, the Diliman Commune, the life of the lumpen proletariat, and the need for armed struggle. During the late 1960s and the 1970s, many artists involved in the national democratic revolution performed plays in the streets. These street plays were important not only as a means to dramatize issues during mass actions but also as a political choice for artists who wanted to change the &ldquo;exclusivity&rdquo; of theater and reach a larger audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An outstanding example is <strong><em>Masaker sa Araw ng Paggawa</em></strong> (Massacre on Labor Day), 1970, written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2997\">Bonifacio Ilagan</a>, directed by Leo Rimando, and performed by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3150\">Panday Sining</a>, the cultural arm of Kabataang Makabayan. First performed at Plaza Miranda, lines on the workers&rsquo; struggle were recited in chorus, and precise movements simultaneously executed by the huge cast who wore red silk kerchiefs on their wrists. Seen from afar by the crowd, the kerchiefs blown by the wind and the precise movements of the cast created color, line, and movement. The play was later restaged by various school chapters of Panday Sining at universities and urban poor communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3284\">Tanghalang Bayan</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Kalbaryo ni Juan de la Cruz</em></strong> (The Calvary of Juan de la Cruz), 1970, performed during Holy Week, Christ represented the Filipino Juan whipped by truncheon-wielding fascists. The procession of the Tondo-based artists, led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5229\">Levy Balgos dela Cruz</a>, started at Pritil Street, passed through Juan Luna, and ended at Plaza Moriones. The play had subsequent performances at Balic-Balic and the university belt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Full-length plays were first staged at theaters, like Philamlife Theater, the Philippine College of Commerce Auditorium, University of the East (UE) Auditorium, and Abelardo Hall at the University of the Philippines (UP), and then performed in the streets. At times, these plays were first performed in the communities or factories before being staged in the auditoriums. Examples from the early 1970s are Kamanyang&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pakikibaka</em></strong> (The Struggle), on the plight of workers; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2967\">Gintong Silahis</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Barikada</em></strong> (Barricades) and <strong><em>Tanging Paraan</em></strong> (The Only Way), directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2835\">Behn Cervantes</a>; Panday Sining&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tunggalian</em></strong>; and Tanghalang Bayan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hukumang Bayan</em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Court), written collectively and directed by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3017\">Anton Juan Jr</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After martial law was declared in 1972, lightning plays were staged in marketplaces. These plays lasted only for a few minutes to enable the actors to avoid arrest. Actors positioned themselves into a tableau, shouted slogans, and left immediately. From 1972 onward, many theater artists were arrested and detained while others focused on organizing work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1975, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a>&rsquo;s poem &ldquo;Ang mga Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan de la Cruz&rdquo; (The Amazing Adventures of Juan de la Cruz) was staged as a play by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3338\">UP Repertory&nbsp;Company</a>. First directed by Ces de Joya, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/611\"><strong><em>Ang Kagila-gilalas &hellip;</em></strong></a> explored a new theater form called <strong>tula-dula</strong> (poem-play). The play was staged mainly at school lobbies during student rallies and at urban poor communities. It was performed by a reader and two actors, one playing the main character, and the other, known as Ms. Ellaneous, playing all the other characters. Other plays in the tula-dula form are Richie Valencia&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/569\"><strong><em>Iskolar ng&nbsp;</em><em>Bayan</em></strong></a> (National Scholar), 1976, and <strong><em>Juan&nbsp;</em><em>Obrero</em></strong> (Juan the Worker), 1977, both directed by Behn Cervantes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 1978 elections and the renewed strength of the protest movement in the late 1970s led to more mass actions, which resulted in the need for street plays. Two other groups were formed: Dulaang Kayumanggi, based in Tondo; and a group with no name, whose members wore cloth masks while performing. The latter first performed in Oct 1979 in a rally protesting tuition hike at the steps of the Arts and Sciences building of UP. Wearing red and black masks similar to that of the movie character Zorro, the group performed a movement play with the narration interpreted through gestures and action influenced by martial arts. The group continued to perform for multi-sectoral assemblies until 1981.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1981 to 1986, the protest movement grew stronger, with the people becoming more outraged by the Aquino assassination in 1983. New theater groups were formed, many of them based in their sectors and regions. Among the student-based groups in Manila were Peryante (formerly known as UP Tropang Bodabil) of UP Diliman; Dugong Silangan of UE; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2921\">ENTABLADO</a> of Ateneo de Manila University; Tamanaba of UP Manila; and Kapilas of De La Salle University. The two active community-based groups were Dulaang Palayag, based in Para&ntilde;aque; and Dulampasigan, based in Pasig. Groups working for their respective sectors were Moog ng Lahi, the cultural group of the Alliance of Concerned Teachers; Tambisan and the Social Samarians Cultural Groups of Artex Malabon, among the workers; and Dulaang Habagat of Malabon, among the urban poor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National problems were found in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3166\">Peryante</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/562\"><strong><em>Ilokula: Ang Ilokanong Drakula I&nbsp;</em><em>and II</em></strong></a> (Ilocula: The Ilocano Dracula), 1980 and 1983, written by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3102\">Chris Millado</a>. <strong><em>Ilokula</em></strong> was performed in the vaudeville style, using songs, dances, and comedy routines, and employed a barker serving as narrator. Referring to Marcos as a Dracula hungry for the blood of the Filipino people, the first version focused on the wealth and power of his family; the second, on his cronies. Masks, props, and costumes were designed by Paeng Altavas for mobility: Ilocula&rsquo;s black cape had pockets that contained props; the papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; masks resembling Marcos and Imelda were light, body parts made of rubber; inflatable huge syringes could be reassembled to become a missile. This enabled the performers to stage the play anywhere from the Palma Hall steps at UP Diliman to the Luneta Grandstand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sectoral issues focused on Mindanao peasants and minorities, as in the Mindanao Alliance&rsquo;s <strong><em>Mindanao: Lupang&nbsp;</em><em>Pangako</em></strong> (Mindanao: Land of Promise), 1984; workers in Dulaang Palanyag&rsquo;s <strong><em>Pabrika</em></strong> (The Factory), 1983; and the plight of teachers in Moog ng Lahi&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/680\"><strong><em><strong>Titser</strong> ng Bayan</em></strong></a> (People&rsquo;s Teacher), 1984. A specific issue, the United States (US) bases, was the topic of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3355\">Rene O. Villanueva</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Siyam na&nbsp;</em><em>Raang Milyong Dolyar</em></strong> (Nine Hundred Million Dollars), 1983, presented by Tuklas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During this period, street theater became synonymous with political theater, creating its own aesthetics in order to meet the demands of the times. At the heart of each play was the issue; plot, form, and production elements followed. The structure of the street play was mainly divided into three parts: first, an exposition on the conditions of the main character/s, which usually represented a sector; second, the onset of difficulties, problems, and oppression; and third, the need for unity and struggle. In some plays, this structure was more complex, but essentially remained the same. There were only two types of main character: the protagonists, such as the peasants, workers, and other oppressed sectors; and the antagonists, such as the dictator, the fascist military, corrupt officials, and the imperialist nations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in the previous period, mobility became the main characteristic of the street play, as shown in costumes, sets, props, music, and sound. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/37/811\">Guitars</a> accompanied songs while indigenous bamboo instruments, used mainly as percussion, provided rhythm and signified scene changes. The mobility of the actors enabled them to perform anywhere: on makeshift stages hastily built before a rally; on top of trucks; on top of huge street flowerpots; inside marketplaces and factories; and on the sidewalk while following an ongoing march.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performers learned how to adapt to all kinds of conditions: venue of the assembly, the number of cast available, the time allotted for preparation, security measures, and the type of audience. Blocking was instantly adjusted to adapt to the space available. At a large venue, such as Liwasang Bonifacio, huge effigies were created or large masks worn by the actors. Actors played multiple roles so that a play could be easily mounted. When there was no time for preparation, playwrights wrote radio scripts that could be performed with only one rehearsal. Masks served two purposes: to show character, and to hide the actor&rsquo;s identity from the military. Rock musicals and vaudeville plays were performed especially for student audiences, which could be considered generally apolitical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several outstanding street plays were produced not only from 1981 to 1986 but also in the years immediately following the 1986 change of government. These plays employed a variety of forms from the traditional to the popular and drew influences from Asia, Latin America, and South Africa.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Transforming the traditional salubong into a political street play, <strong><em><strong>Salubong</strong> sa Maynila</em></strong> (Meeting in Manila), 1984, was performed by the members of UP Repertory Company, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2915\">Dulaang UP</a>, Peryante, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4016\">Inang Laya</a>. Performing on top of a truck in Liwasang Bonifacio, the actors wore brown papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; masks and black veils. At the center was the Virgin Mary in an Inang Bayan costume. The script, recited by readers as the performers moved, included prayer chants and songs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1983, an effigy play titled <strong><em>Babala ng Lawin</em></strong> (The Hawk&rsquo;s Warning), directed by Cris Gosalvez, was performed by the League of Filipino Students Cultural Group in front of the Embassy of the United States. The narration read by an actor holding a microphone was interpreted by two effigies, the hawk and the eagle, representing the Philippines and the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Artex Cultural Group reenacted in 1985 the strike they had staged the previous year. Faithful to the incident, workers playing the role of hired goons walked from the far end of the street toward the picket line, where the other actors were playing themselves as strikers. They then proceeded to reenact how the goons destroyed the picket, resulting in bloodshed. Performed by those who actually participated or witnessed the event, and staged during the anniversary of the strike, the reenactment became a ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to the play by the Artex performers were those performed by groups such as the Negros Theater League and Dulaang Katilingban. Their improvisational plays were performed to immediately reenact an event, such as the arrest of a <strong>sacada</strong> (seasonal cane worker), or the massacre of workers staging a demonstration. Students of colleges usually performed during rallies held in the streets of Bacolod while sugarcane workers and their children staged their improvisations inside the haciendas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other plays were influenced by theater in Latin America and South Africa. Techniques from Augusto Boal&rsquo;s image theater proved to be an effective means to discuss the boycott campaign during the Batasang Pambansa elections in May 1984. The play, performed in front of Isetann Department Store by a volunteer cultural team led by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5094\">Joi Barrios</a> and Malou Maniquis, urged the audience to become participants. The actors first presented to the crowd three images: the present, the ideal, and the transitional. Volunteers were then asked to change the images as they wished, adding or subtracting characters; changing the blocking or movement of the cast; or acting the roles themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the first decade of the 21st century, the street plays were similar to those of the Marcos years (Barrios 2014). They used traditional rituals, rites, and cultural forms; featured confrontation with trauma through reenactments; used horror, romance, and humor; had an indefinite spatial location between audience and actors; and highlighted &ldquo;the need for both actors and audience to envision and &lsquo;perform&rsquo; victory so that they might have the will to struggle on&rdquo; (Barrios 2014, 91).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Oct 2003, when US President George W. Bush visited the Philippines, the Congress of Teachers and Educators for Nationalism and Democracy performed <strong><em>Romansang <strong>Horror</strong></em></strong> (A Horrifying Romance). The play portrayed the Arroyo-Bush alliance as a love story, referring to Arroyo&rsquo;s repeated declarations of support for the United States&rsquo; &ldquo;war on terror.&rdquo; A protest action, <strong><em>Hatol ng Bayan sa Kaso ng Hacienda Luisita</em></strong> (The People&rsquo;s Verdict on the Hacienda Luisita Case), was held to express condemnation of the violent dispersal of the picket lines on 16 Nov 2004, when seven workers were killed and 181 wounded, and 110 arrested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 1 May 2005, a street play was staged by young actors from the Kilusang Mayo Uno at the Liwasang Bonifacio. As the oppressors or &ldquo;evil&rdquo; characters, actors wore masks representing the president, Uncle Sam as US imperialism, and the soldiers that safeguard the power of the status quo. On the other hand, &ldquo;good&rdquo; characters, such as the workers, peasants, and other oppressed sectors in Philippine society, played themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Street theater continues to reach a large audience. Rituals and dances continue to be an essential part of the everyday life of ethnic groups. During Lent and Christmas, community members become actors in various religious plays. In Metro Manila, political street theater continues to be an essential part of rallies and demonstrations, while in the regions, plays continue to be performed wherever the people may be assembled: from town plazas to seashores and basketball courts. In all of these, street theater continues to be defined not by venue but by its goals and the audience it performs for.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span> <em><strong>Written by Joi Barrios with <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

The kinabayo performed in Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte, dramatizes the Battle of Covadonga, said to have occurred in 718 AD between the Christian general Pelayo and the Moro Alkamah. The battle, enacted on the 24th of July, has since changed venues through the years: from the streets, as part of the morning procession; to a bamboo stage in the church patio, when revised in 1952; and finally, to the grounds of the provincial high school in the 1980s. The bakahan, of San Antonio, Kalayaan, Laguna, is performed by boys dressed in mask-headdresses, capes, bands, and swords.

During the late 1960s and the 1970s, many artists involved in the national democratic revolution performed plays in the streets.

The parade ends in front of a stage with a set representing Herod&rsquo;s palace. The play begins with the kings going up the stage to talk to Herod, who welcomes them but cannot tell them where the Messiah has been born. The Kings go down the stage, walk around the little square and end up adoring the image of the Infant Jesus, enthroned on an altar in one corner of the patio and guarded by angels and the higante couple. Tired of waiting, Herod sends his soldiers after the kings but the soldiers come back empty-handed.

The parade ends in front of a stage with a set representing Herod&#x2019;s palace. The play begins with the kings going up the stage to talk to Herod, who welcomes them but cannot tell them where the Messiah has been born. The Kings go down the stage, walk around the little square and end up adoring the image of the Infant Jesus, enthroned on an altar in one corner of the patio and guarded by angels and the higante couple. Tired of waiting, Herod sends his soldiers after the kings but the soldiers come back empty-handed. In anger, Herod orders the massacre of all baby boys below two years of age and ends the play with mad laughter.<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

		"text": "<p><strong><strong>Tubong</strong></strong>, meaning &ldquo;crown&rdquo; or &ldquo;to crown,&rdquo; is a coronation ritual practiced in the island of Marinduque. It is performed by the <strong>manunubong</strong> (initiator), usually, elder women and men, before a <strong>punsyon</strong> (initiate, celebrant, or honoree), together with invited <strong>bisita</strong> (guests). Its primary intention is to &ldquo;heal&rdquo; spiritual maladies, like the sickness of the <strong>kaluluwa</strong> or soul, or illnesses like fever, cholera, convulsion believed to be caused by supernatural elements, and other unknown reasons. It is also a way to celebrate special events, such as birthdays (namely, the 1st, 7th, 18th, 21st, and 60th), weddings, baptisms, anniversaries, and other life-cycle events. It has also become a welcome ceremony of the locals for the visitors of the island. At present, the ritual is also called <strong>putong</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tubong in general is composed of <strong>musikang pantinig</strong> or vocal music, consisting of singing or chanting; playing of musical instruments, such as guitar, banjo, and tambourine; and movements or dance. The whole ritual follows 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4 rhythmic patterns, which may correspond to the musical qualities of <strong>martsa</strong>, <strong>balse</strong>, and <strong>lento</strong>, respectively. Its performance has several versions depending on the town, the community of manunubong that performs it, and the source of the narrative being chanted.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Brief descriptions of various tubong versions with their own narratives come from oral accounts of local practitioners who inherited the tradition. <strong>Tubong Banahaw</strong> is based on the mystical Banahaw Mountain in Tayabas, Quezon. <strong>Tubong Herarkias</strong> features the hierarchies of the Christian Holy Trinity&mdash; <strong>Diyos Ama</strong> (the Father), <strong>Diyos <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong></strong> (the Son), and <strong>Diyos Espiritu Santo</strong> (the Holy Spirit). During the ritual, the Holy Trinity, together with several cherubims, are believed to visit <strong>tao</strong> (human being, the celebrant) who is the lowest in the hierarchy. <strong>Tubong Kalagyo</strong> is associated with <strong>angel de la guardia</strong> (guardian angel) or <strong>kaluluwa</strong> (human spirit or soul). Based on <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong> <strong>Genesis</strong></em></strong></a>, <strong>Tubong sa Pasyon</strong> is enacted only on Ash Wednesdays, the beginning of the&nbsp;<em>cuaresma&nbsp;</em>or Catholic Lent, and onward until Sabado de Gloria (Black Saturday). The coronation is offered to the Virgin Mary. <strong>Tubong habanera</strong> may have come from the movement motif of habanera, which is an element of this version. <strong>Putong Bangbang</strong> is practiced by two manunubong groups in Bangbang, Gasan, Marinduque, which are the Senior Putong Group and Junior Putong Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The punsyon being regarded as a Saint, who shares veneration with the Diyos Ama, Anak, and Espiritu Santo (Holy Trinity), together with Birheng Maria (Virgin Mary), may imply its highly Catholic religious context and narrative. Below is an excerpt of the chant from the <strong><em>Kinse Misteryos</em></strong><em>/</em>Putong Bangbang:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p>Ito&rsquo;y ang koronang binatbat ng ginto</p>\r\n\r\n<p>O mahal na Santa&rsquo;y/Santo&rsquo;y tanggapin mo na po</p>\r\n\r\n<p>narito&rsquo;t kalakip ang aming pagsuyo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>nanggaling at buhat sa atay ko&rsquo;t puso.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Labas magmadali ang isa sa inyo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ang dalang korona&rsquo;y iputong sa ulo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ang ngalan ng Ama, Espiritu Santo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>suma&rsquo;atin nawa ang personang tatlo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yamang nariyan ka na sa mahal mong trono</p>\r\n\r\n<p>at kokoronahan ng personang tatlo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ang palma&rsquo;y sa kamay korona&rsquo;y sa ulo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>kasabay ay sabog asusena&rsquo;t liryo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(This is a crown made of gold</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oh, beloved Saint, please accept it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>given to you with love</p>\r\n\r\n<p>that comes from our liver and heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hurry, one of you</p>\r\n\r\n<p>put on the crown that you are carrying</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the name of the Father, the Holy Spirit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May the Holy Trinity be with us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since you are seated in your holy throne</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the Holy Trinity will crown you</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scepter is for the hands, and the crown,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>on the head as we throw white lily and lily bulb.)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Its folk essence can be attributed to its practice outside the Catholic Church. Hence, the performance narrative can be both sacred and secular. The tubong may consist of five or six sections&mdash;namely, &ldquo;Sa Labas ng Tarangkahan&rdquo; (Outside the Gate); &ldquo;Pagsusunson&rdquo; (Picking Up) or &ldquo;Panawagan&rdquo; (Calling Out); &ldquo;Sa Loob ng Bahay&rdquo; (Inside the House); Presentation of regalia in the Coronation; &ldquo;Puri&rdquo; (Praise) and &ldquo;Berso&rdquo; (Verse) and the &ldquo;Hunot-Boronot&rdquo; (Taking-Out), a unique section in Putong Bangbang; and &ldquo;Viva Mabuhay&rdquo; (Long Live) or &ldquo;Sabugan&rdquo; (Showering).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten to fifteen manunubong, commissioned by the sponsor (usually relatives of the celebrant) or the punsyon himself/herself, start outside the gate or house of the invitee announcing their presence. Usually in a standing position, they execute <strong>pahagod</strong> (hesitation side step) movement motif. They continue chanting &ldquo;<em>Tao po kami, tao po</em>&rdquo; (You have visitors, anybody home?), the usual Filipino greeting upon entering a house, while doing <strong>sulong-lakad</strong> (frontal walk) slowly toward the <strong>hagdan na may baitang</strong> (stairs with steps). This section, called <strong>pagsusunson</strong>, announces their intention to perform the <strong>sunson</strong> (literally, to pick up) toward the punsyon and ask his/her permission to enter the <strong>bahay na marikit</strong> (pretty house) or the symbolic Jerusalem. Some call this section the <strong>panawagan</strong>, from the word&nbsp;<em>tawag&nbsp;</em>or call. As they enter the house, the punsyon is seated in between two &ldquo;angels&rdquo; holding lit candles. Young members of the family usually perform as angels. On some occasions, the punsyon is initially covered with white cloth. They greet the punsyon who is treated like a blessed saint. Presentation of regalia for the punsyon follows this order: crown, scepter, flowers, <strong>sensilyo</strong> or coins, and sometimes <strong>palara</strong> (paper foil), <strong>luminarya mayor</strong> (paper-made moon), <strong>labindalawang bituin</strong> (12 stars), and <strong>alampay</strong> (shawl, for female celebrant). Then, a manunubong crowns the punsyon, sometimes inside a <strong>kubol</strong>, a makeshift altar that serves as the celebrant&rsquo;s holy throne. This is the most significant motif of the ritual, with <strong>sulong</strong> (advancing) and <strong>yuko</strong> (sinking) as body movements. In the <strong><em>Kinse Misteryos</em></strong> (Fifteen Mysteries)/Putong Bangbang, the coronation is followed by poetry renditions called <strong>puri</strong> (praise) and <strong>berso</strong> (verse), and the <strong>hunot-boronot</strong> (taking-out), a magical act that features long strips of paper coming out from the mouth of a manunubong. The manunubong execute a combination of movement motifs: pahagod or hesitation step; <strong>matsar</strong>, a movement with head slightly down and done as though searching for a bird in the rice field; balse or waltz; <strong>hakbang na may sadsad</strong> or step with a brush; sulong-lakad or frontal walk; <strong>pagluhod</strong> or kneeling; and other gestures such as the <strong>kampay</strong>, an arm movement in lateral/sideward directions done left-right interchangeably, and <strong>sabugan</strong>. Everyone shouts &ldquo;<em>Viva! Mabuhay!</em>&rdquo; (Long live, long live!). Then, the <strong>kainan</strong> (feast) ends the celebration when everybody shares the banquet prepared by the punsyon. Dishes and drinks are served. The banquet depends on how big or small the event is, or how financially capable the sponsors (usually relatives of the celebrant) and punsyon are. The quantity of food does not matter much. What is important for the manunubong is how the sponsors and punsyon regard them. This regard is called&nbsp;<em>estima</em>&mdash;a combination of expressive, affective, and gestural approach toward others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transformations.</strong> Transformations happenedin the 1960s when outside influences started to affect the cultural activities in Marinduque, particularly the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/459\"><strong>moriones</strong></a>, and eventually the tubong tradition. The popularity of the moriones paved the way for Marinduque province to become a tourist destination. It attracted many visitors who helped bring about a change in the tubong tradition&rsquo;s social function. From its intentions of communal healing and Catholic-influenced veneration, the tubong became a welcome ceremony for visitors from outside the province. In the 1960s, Mr Julian Mogol, Schools Division superintendent of Marinduque, and Mrs Iluminada Nepomuceno, a music teacher, convened public teachers to gather, document, and study the music and dance of tubong versions practiced in the towns of Boac, Gasan, and Mogpog. The result of this initiative was a new and shortened (30-45 min) version of the performance. It is a mixture of tubong versions from the three towns called <strong><em>Putong ng mga Maestra</em></strong> (Putong of the Teachers), which was performed for guests and visitors of the teachers. Eventually, this version became popular in Boac, thus the name <strong><em>Putong ng mga Taga-Bayan</em></strong> (Putong of the Capital Town). Marching band player, tubong practitioner, and Mogpog town mayor Senen Livelo, quoting the old members of the community, calls this version <strong>sinalampakutan</strong>, or an amalgam of all the tubong versions practiced in Marinduque. The term has a derogatory tone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The local government officially calls it <strong>Marinduque Putong</strong> <em>.</em>As part of the institutionalization of the tubong, the provincial government under the administration of Jose Antonio Carrion approved an ordinance declaring 11 Feb as the Putong Festival day of Marinduque. The Marinduque provincial government has its own putong group, which usually performs for official functions. Carmencita O. Reyes herself, governor and former congresswoman of the province, played a part in transforming the putong&rsquo;s elements. The crown, ideally fashioned with flowers but usually made from paper, is now made from local&nbsp;<em>nito</em>, a kind of climbing fern. At its center is a small centurion mask, another cultural icon of the province. Reyes also added the element of flying butterflies toward the end of the ceremony to make use of the emerging&nbsp;<em>bila-bila&nbsp;</em>industries in the province. As the main function of the performance is to welcome the visitors of the province, she added an excerpt of the song:</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"verse\">\r\n<p>Maligayang araw at oras ng pagdating</p>\r\n\r\n<p>bilang pasalubong sa ating panauhin</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tunay na galak ang lahat, ang nariritong bulaklak</p>\r\n\r\n<p>awit at sayawan naman ang nagkaganyan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Joyful day and hour of arrival</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a welcome present to our dear guests</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are truly glad, the flowers,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>songs, and dances are the cause.)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking it in its ritual context, National Artist for dance <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2570\">Francisca Reyes-Aquino</a> included the putong in her <strong><em>Philippine <strong>Folk Dance</strong>s</em></strong> (volumes 1-5, 1953, 1960, 1973). Together with music composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3915\">Antonino Buenaventura</a>, Reyes-Aquino published its dance notation, which has four musical parts (A, B, C, and D) and nine sections highlighting habanera steps, together with sway balance steps, with a brush and sway balance and a hop. In 1989, the dance and music notations of the putong or <strong>putungan</strong> was also included in <strong><em>Duyan ng Magiting: The Folk Culture of the Southern Tagalog Region</em></strong>. The putong is now part of the dance repertoire of many companies, like the Philippine Performing Arts Company of San Diego, California, and the University of San Carlos Dance Troupe of Cebu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are about 80 local groups practicing versions of tubong/putong (Viray 2010). New groups have been formed, like the Junior Putong Group, which started in 1997. Its members reside in Bangbang, Gasan. The group has introduced innovations in their local practice of putong. They transformed the rhythm of lento into a slow-rock rendition using the banjo, guitar, and tambourine, with vocal shouts or&nbsp;<em>gimik&nbsp;</em>(ornaments, effects). Romy Cicista, the group&rsquo;s lead composer and banjo player, associates the word &ldquo;junior&rdquo; with the youth trends. For him, the youth&rsquo;s songs are like &ldquo;<em>patalon-talon</em>&rdquo; (literally, &ldquo;jumping&rdquo;), so he suggested to the group to try a faster beat and rhythm like rock or slow rock. Also, in 2014, Asuncion Soleta-Sumo, the daughter of a former magpuputong, deliberately changed the martsa movement to suit her own movement aesthetics. Before, the movement was like searching for a bird in the rice field. She changed this into what she calls &ldquo;double step&rdquo; to accommodate the changes in the music&rsquo;s beat and rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Junior Bangbang Putong also claims that a spontaneous <strong>sayawan</strong> or <strong>indakan</strong> (dancing) is their invention. It is done after the main ritual. Participants, such as the manunubong, punsyon, and the bisita, dance through the invitation of the initiators. Musicians play contemporary music, mostly novelty and popular songs, while participants dance combinations of localized ballroom dances, such as the chachacha, jive, boogie, and swing. This is the part of the event in which participants deliberately break away from the main ritual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These developments prove that the tubong or putong has ritual elements that are open to performative transformations.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Bryan L.

Usually in a standing position, they execute <strong>pahagod</strong> (hesitation side step) movement motif. They continue chanting &#x201C;<em>Tao po kami, tao po</em>&#x201D; (You have visitors, anybody home?), the usual Filipino greeting upon entering a house, while doing <strong>sulong-lakad</strong> (frontal walk) slowly toward the <strong>hagdan na may baitang</strong> (stairs with steps). This section, called <strong>pagsusunson</strong>, announces their intention to perform the <strong>sunson</strong> (literally, to pick up) toward the punsyon and ask his/her permission to enter the <strong>bahay na marikit</strong> (pretty house) or the symbolic Jerusalem. Some call this section the <strong>panawagan</strong>, from the word&#xA0;<em>tawag&#xA0;</em>or call. As they enter the house, the punsyon is seated in between two &#x201C;angels&#x201D; holding lit candles. Young members of the family usually perform as angels. On some occasions, the punsyon is initially covered with white cloth. They greet the punsyon who is treated like a blessed saint. Presentation of regalia for the punsyon follows this order: crown, scepter, flowers, <strong>sensilyo</strong> or coins, and sometimes <strong>palara</strong> (paper foil), <strong>luminarya mayor</strong> (paper-made moon), <strong>labindalawang bituin</strong> (12 stars), and <strong>alampay</strong> (shawl, for female celebrant). Then, a manunubong crowns the punsyon, sometimes inside a <strong>kubol</strong>, a makeshift altar that serves as the celebrant&#x2019;s holy throne. This is the most significant motif of the ritual, with <strong>sulong</strong> (advancing) and <strong>yuko</strong> (sinking) as body movements. In the <strong><em>Kinse Misteryos</em></strong> (Fifteen Mysteries)/Putong Bangbang, the coronation is followed by poetry renditions called <strong>puri</strong> (praise) and <strong>berso</strong> (verse), and the <strong>hunot-boronot</strong> (taking-out), a magical act that features long strips of paper coming out from the mouth of a manunubong. The manunubong execute a combination of movement motifs: pahagod or hesitation step; <strong>matsar</strong>, a movement with head slightly down and done as though searching for a bird in the rice field; balse or waltz; <strong>hakbang na may sadsad</strong> or step with a brush; sulong-lakad or frontal walk; <strong>pagluhod</strong> or kneeling; and other gestures such as the <strong>kampay</strong>, an arm movement in lateral/sideward directions done left-right interchangeably, and <strong>sabugan</strong>. Everyone shouts &#x201C;<em>Viva! Mabuhay!</em>&#x201D; (Long live, long live!). Then, the <strong>kainan</strong> (feast) ends the celebration when everybody shares the banquet prepared by the punsyon. Dishes and drinks are served. The banquet depends on how big or small the event is, or how financially capable the sponsors (usually relatives of the celebrant) and punsyon are. The quantity of food does not matter much. What is important for the manunubong is how the sponsors and punsyon regard them. This regard is called&#xA0;<em>estima</em>&#x2014;a combination of expressive, affective, and gestural approach toward others."

The popularity of the moriones paved the way for Marinduque province to become a tourist destination. It attracted many visitors who helped bring about a change in the tubong tradition&#x2019;s social function. From its intentions of communal healing and Catholic-influenced veneration, the tubong became a welcome ceremony for visitors from outside the province. In the 1960s, Mr Julian Mogol, Schools Division superintendent of Marinduque, and Mrs Iluminada Nepomuceno, a music teacher, convened public teachers to gather, document, and study the music and dance of tubong versions practiced in the towns of Boac, Gasan, and Mogpog. The result of this initiative was a new and shortened (30-45 min) version of the performance. It is a mixture of tubong versions from the three towns called <strong><em>Putong ng mga Maestra</em></strong> (Putong of the Teachers), which was performed for guests and visitors of the teachers. Eventually, this version became popular in Boac, thus the name <strong><em>Putong ng mga Taga-Bayan</em></strong> (Putong of the Capital Town). Marching band player, tubong practitioner, and Mogpog town mayor Senen Livelo, quoting the old members of the community, calls this version <strong>sinalampakutan</strong>, or an amalgam of all the tubong versions practiced in Marinduque. The term has a derogatory tone."

Reyes herself, governor and former congresswoman of the province, played a part in transforming the putong&#x2019;s elements. The crown, ideally fashioned with flowers but usually made from paper, is now made from local&#xA0;<em>nito</em>, a kind of climbing fern. At its center is a small centurion mask, another cultural icon of the province. Reyes also added the element of flying butterflies toward the end of the ceremony to make use of the emerging&#xA0;<em>bila-bila&#xA0;</em>industries in the province. As the main function of the performance is to welcome the visitors of the province, she added an excerpt of the song:"

Its members reside in Bangbang, Gasan. The group has introduced innovations in their local practice of putong. They transformed the rhythm of lento into a slow-rock rendition using the banjo, guitar, and tambourine, with vocal shouts or&#xA0;<em>gimik&#xA0;</em>(ornaments, effects). Romy Cicista, the group&#x2019;s lead composer and banjo player, associates the word &#x201C;junior&#x201D; with the youth trends. For him, the youth&#x2019;s songs are like &#x201C;<em>patalon-talon</em>&#x201D; (literally, &#x201C;jumping&#x201D;), so he suggested to the group to try a faster beat and rhythm like rock or slow rock. Also, in 2014, Asuncion Soleta-Sumo, the daughter of a former magpuputong, deliberately changed the martsa movement to suit her own movement aesthetics. Before, the movement was like searching for a bird in the rice field. She changed this into what she calls &#x201C;double step&#x201D; to accommodate the changes in the music&#x2019;s beat and rhythm."

Musicians play contemporary music, mostly novelty and popular songs, while participants dance combinations of localized ballroom dances, such as the chachacha, jive, boogie, and swing. This is the part of the event in which participants deliberately break away from the main ritual."

		"text": "<p><strong><strong>Tula-dula</strong></strong> &mdash;literally, &ldquo;poem-play&rdquo;&mdash;refers to a minimalist form of theater developed in the mid-1970s by the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3338\">University of the Philippines Repertory&nbsp;Company (UPRC)</a>. It consists of a poem that is dramatized by the use of a narrator, who reads out all the parts and provides all the sounds and special effects, and one, two, or more actors who mime all the roles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first poem to be performed as a tula-dula was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5429\">Jose F. Lacaba</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/611\">Ang mga Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan de la Cruz</a>&rdquo; (The Amazing Adventures of Juan de la Cruz), 1975. As the narrator read out the poem, one actor played ordinary citizen Juan de la Cruz&mdash;walking the streets, looking for a job, looking for a girl, getting hungry, being frustrated at every turn, eventually feeling so angry he turns despair into defiance and runs off to the mountains to join the rebels. The other actor played all the other characters: a bus conductor, a street, a wall, a ticket seller, a gardener, a soldier, a pimp, the sea waves, a bishop, and finally a Philippine Constabulary soldier. Props and bits of costume, such as a police officer&rsquo;s hat and nightstick, a skirt, and a bandanna, were laid out on the floor and picked up by the actor when needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The form was convenient because it required a minimum of personnel and equipment, and especially because it was economical (in a theater beset by endemic poverty), portable (it could go to town plazas, classrooms, school auditoriums, large or small spaces), and completely adaptable to budgets, costumes, props, and actors available. It could use one microphone to perform before big rallies.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Other poems and scripts were later written especially for the tula-dula form, such as Richie Valencia&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/569\"><strong>Iskolar ng Bayan</strong></a></em></strong> (People&rsquo;s Scholar), 1976, about one day in the life of a UP student, and <strong><em>Juan&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Obrero</em></strong> (Juan the Worker), 1977, about the travails of a worker in a factory. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, teachers&rsquo; organizations wrote and acted out <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/680\"><strong><em><strong>Titser</strong> ng&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Bayan</em></strong></a> (People&rsquo;s Teacher), which exposed the life of an overworked and underpaid teacher under the dictatorship, while media people expounded on their lives with <strong><em>Juan Peryodista</em></strong> (Juan the Journalist), 1984. Up to the years of the 21st century in the UP Diliman campus, the UPRC would continue to dramatize in the tula-dula form Isko (short for scholar) experiences and concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theater form tula-dula, mainly associated with UPRC, may have similarities with the dula-tula, dramatized <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, evolved from the Basic Integrated Theater Arts Workshop module of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a>, circa 1980s, the dula-tula module. This module, usually the first module after the initial orientation process, emphasized release and improvisatory skills as learning processes for participants&rsquo; awareness of basic artistic elements and composition for theater. As a release module, the participants, usually numbering 20-30, plunged into exercises that tapped into their artistic selves, at the same time that they encouraged the sharing of ideas, collective spontaneous creative improvisations, and interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final showcase of the module, also called a&nbsp;<em>dula-tula</em>, exuded a variety of dramatic and staging possibilities, including improvisations by actors with dialogues on given situations (e.g., characters seen and heard on a Quiapo church sidewalk), or the use of actors&rsquo; bodies as props and set-props (e.g., a group of actors forming the shape and movement of a helicopter or the facade of a church. Very often, these improvisations were strung together in a poem, usually evolved by the participants themselves, with the poetic lines integrated into the other elements of the staging. In some cases, the dula-tula approximated the <strong>sabayang pagbigkas</strong> (simultaneous group recitation) of many Philippine high school Filipino classes, and that of the more defined dramatic convention, the chorus. An example of dula-tula as chorus would be scenes from <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/573\"><strong>Juan Tamban</strong></a></em></strong>, where the chorus recited in unison a poetic stanza or two, even perhaps set to music, but the chorus would eventually also be characters in the dramatizations that preceded or followed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seen in the context of that period, poetry was indeed being integrated into the theater syntax, regardless of labels. The revolutionary atmosphere particularly in the student and youth sector influenced their theater arts, freed from the conventions of realist staging, and attuned to the demands of organized political agendas. To a certain degree, theater was free to innovate, and theater welcomed poetry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almost at the same time as the UPRC, in 1975, the Metropolitan Teen Theater League mounted <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3090\">Rosalie Matilac</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Kasi Babae Raw</em></strong> (Because They Are Women), which used two women narrators exchanging dialogues in verse, one dressed in old generation attire, the other in the modern style of denims and T-shirts. It dramatized the status of women from the Spanish colonization to the contemporary period. Scenes of many&nbsp;<em>manang&nbsp;</em>(women devotees) in churches were recreated, as well as a beauty contest, the wet look of&nbsp;<em>bomba&nbsp;</em>films, and sexy product endorsers of brandy. There were also scenes of women workers in factories, from whose sector change would be initiated. In the end, the two narrators agreed on the need for women to fight for their freedom and their rights. A song on the new identity of women closed the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tula-dula innovations were invariably political in content, a product of the revolutionary movement of the 1970s, as well as of the economics of Philippine theater, the assortment of venues for theater, and the agile inventiveness of writers and theater groups.<span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.
