		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">In the early days of radio and television, <b>advertisements</b> were produced and aired live or in real time. Some radio and television programs continue such practice. On radio, the program host, announcer-on-board, or disc jockey reads the advertising copy, which can be as simple as incorporating the brand name in the program title, like &ldquo;<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1459\"><strong>The</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Listerine Amateur Hour</strong></a>,&rdquo; or adding the phrase &ldquo;Inihahandog ng &hellip;&rdquo; (Brought to you by &hellip;), followed by the name and slogan of the brand. On television, this is a talking head or a close-up of the program host presenting the product or a celebrity casually plugging a brand while delivering a spiel. These formats are sometimes punctuated by sound effects or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/65/1395\">music</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">This simple presentation of the marketer&rsquo;s message changed into more complicated production treatments. Notable among these later formats was the singing of the product jingle; the dramatization of the selling proposition using dialogue, music, sound, and visual effects; and product benefit demonstration&mdash;all aired live. Advertisers adapted the format of popular broadcast genres, like narratives, to take advantage of their popularity, consequently capturing the viewer&rsquo;s attention for their messages. On the other hand, the use of documentary and news formats, as well as the hosts associated with them, provided commercials with the credibility associated with these genres.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The introduction of more sophisticated audio and audiovisual production technologies permitted the pre-recording of advertising materials that can be aired repeatedly without incurring the cost of hiring talents to perform the commercial live during the course of broadcast. These new technologies included less expensive magnetic tape recording and playback machines for audio materials, film-to-video transfer (telecine transfer), and video recording and editing for audiovisual materials. The formats used in advertising materials, however, remained similar to those of earlier programs aired on radio and television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music, a popular form of broadcast content, was later employed in selling products. This is the <b>commercial jingle</b>. The jingle of United American Tiki Tiki, a multivitamin for children, was aired on radio repeatedly, giving it a strong brand recall since the 1950s. In the 2000s, the brand used the same melody line for its commercials.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some ads became popular because of the slogans or tag lines in their commercials. Examples in the 1970s include &ldquo;Para kang nakasandal sa pader&rdquo; (It&rsquo;s as if you were leaning on a solid wall) of the Philippine National Bank, &ldquo;Iba na ang matangkad&rdquo; (It pays to be tall) of Star Margarine, and &ldquo;E di ibalik ang swerti&rdquo; (Okay, let&rsquo;s sweep luck back) by the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. Other notable examples include &ldquo;Sino&rsquo;ng best friend mo doon? Siyempre, ikaw lang!&rdquo; (Who is going to be your best friend over there? Who else but you!) of Nestle Ice Cream in the 1980s and &ldquo;suportahan taka&rdquo; (I will support you) of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company in 2001. One advertisement that managed to maintain its slogan over the years is that of Safeguard in which an alter ego of the woman character speaks the line &ldquo;Ako ang iyong konsensiya&rdquo; (I am your conscience), which has become a standard in practically all ads of the bath soap from the 1970s until the present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The various styles of dramas, such as soap operas, slice-of-life, situational and stand-up comedy, and vignettes or a montage of slices-of-life, can also be seen in radio and television commercials. Most memorable in the mid-1970s was the Kodak television commercial that used Paul Anka&rsquo;s song &ldquo;Times of Your Life&rdquo; in which actor <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4552\"><strong>Mario Montenegro</strong></a></strong></strong> reminisces about his life with his daughter Hanilet who is getting married. The Lumen television advertisement series of the laundry detergent Surf in the 1990s banked on the popularity of serialized soap operas on Philippine television. The Lumen<b> </b>commercials, just like a soap opera, was a series of advertisements that followed the lives of newlywed Lumen, her husband Tonyo, their twins, and her mother-in-law <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Obang who showed consumers how to save money by using Surf. The slice-of-life Modess radio commercial <b><i>Kabaliwan</i></b>, 1993, dramatized the myth that taking a bath when menstruating leads to insanity to promote a shift from a <i>pasador</i> (cloth napkin) to the more contemporary disposable sanitary napkin. <b><i>Pulutan</i></b><i> </i>(Appetizer), 1984, a television commercial of San Miguel Beer, was a situational comedy series featuring comedian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4896\">Bert Marcelo</a>, singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4134\">Rico Puno</a>, horse racer Jockey Eduardo, billiards champion Amang Parica, and boxer Flash Elorde. Set in a drinking pub, these personalities argue on what pulutan to go with their beer and end up with the bright idea of &ldquo;isang platitong mani&rdquo; (a saucer of peanuts), which became a household punch line at the time the advertisement was aired. Wit, pun, and smart turn of phrases have also been used in commercials as seen in the 2005 Dolfenal advertisement that featured <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4414\"><strong>Dolphy</strong></a></strong></strong> with the lines &ldquo;Laughter is not the best medicine&hellip; Madali pang tandaan (Easy to remember): Dolphy, Dolfenal.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The resurgence and popularity in the 2000s of serialized dramas on television, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/64/1355\"><b>teleserye</b></a>, gave rise to the <b>branded content</b> or branded entertainment format of television commercials. Unlike the usual commercials where product features are directly promoted, these dramas, comedies, or miniseries promote a single brand by incorporating images of the product into the story. Branded content is aired as part of a station&rsquo;s programming and is not interrupted by other advertisements. The short film <b><i>Karga</i></b> (Loaded), 2014, included in the 9th <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4842\">GMA</a> Christmas Short Film Festival, tells the story of a Shell gas attendant who returned the money that a customer had accidentally dropped at the station, even if the attendant badly needed the money for his sick daughter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Riding on the popularity of broadcast programs, advertisements use the premise of these programs as a springboard for commercials and appear to be extensions of the popular program. Richard Yap and Jodi Sta. Maria, the lead characters in the highly rated series <b><i>Be Careful with My Heart</i></b>, 2012-14, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a></strong></strong>, play their roles as Sir Chief and Maya, respectively, in the <b>situmercial</b>&mdash;a portmanteau for situation and commercial&mdash;for Amaia, a housing development project of Ayala Land in which overseas Filipino workers can invest their earnings. In the commercial, Sir Chief and Maya talk about ordinary people&rsquo;s dreams of owning their own home, which can be made possible through Amaia.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Commercials also adopt from literature and events in history. The 1970s Superwheel detergent bar commercial series lampoons Samson and Delilah, Anthony and Cleopatra, Camelot, and the like. The EQ Diaper television commercial, 2014, spoofs the encounter between Lapu-Lapu and Magellan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The documentary genre can also be seen in commercials with real-life events, interviews, demonstrations, and testimonials. Milo&rsquo;s <b><i>Gymnast</i></b>, 1987, documents a day in the life of Bea Lucero as she wakes up, eats breakfast, goes to school, and practices gymnastics. In Joy Dishwashing Liquid commercials, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4905\"><strong>Michael V.</strong></a></strong></strong> interviews housewives and conducts product demonstrations like scientific experiments. Celebrity product endorsers like <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4750\"><strong>Boy Abunda</strong></a></strong></strong>, Kris Aquino, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4590\"><strong>Piolo Pascual</strong></a></strong></strong>, and many others can be heard and seen using and endorsing products with their testimonials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In <b>stealth advertising</b>, the news format is adapted in the presentation of the product. Mike Enriquez, in<i> </i>DZBB&rsquo;s <b><i>Super Balita sa Umaga Nationwide</i></b> (Super Morning News Nationwide), which premiered in Jan 2007, uses this news format in endorsing Artho, a food supplement to help ease the pain of arthritis. He integrates this plug in the news program with the following opening spiel: &ldquo;Alam n&rsquo;yo, mga kapuso, Enero ngayon, malamig na naman ang panahon. Uso na naman ang aray-tiis. Masakit na naman ang ating mga kasu-kasuan &hellip;&rdquo; (You know, our dear followers, it&rsquo;s January, the cool weather has set in. It&rsquo;s again the season of &ldquo;bearing the pain.&rdquo; Our arthritis is on the attack.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The advent of the music video in the 1980s gave rise to the jingle-based <b>music video advertisement</b>. The Palmolive Soap with Beauty Cream television advertisement in 1987, which featured Alice Dixson and Sheila Ysrael, showed a combination of song, dance, and special effects&mdash;ingredients of early music videos. This commercial ended with Alice Dixson singing &ldquo;I can feel it&rdquo; as she shook one shoulder and naughtily faced the camera.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The combination of different broadcast genres in a single program can also be seen in radio and television advertisements. Typical is a song interspersed with an announcer&rsquo;s voice-over. <b><i>Do, Re, Mi</i></b>, 1981, a radio commercial of Dequadin lozenges, begins with a tenor singing the two octaves of a musical scale. Before he reaches the last note, an announcer interrupts the singing with &ldquo;This last note is brought to you by Dequadin.&rdquo; After the singer hits the last note, the announcer says, &ldquo;Dequadin. All-out support to take the sore out of your throat.&rdquo; <b><i>Labadami-Labango</i></b> (Heavy Load of Laundry, Fragrant Laundry), 1987, the Mr. Clean advertisement featuring singer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4875\">Sylvia La Torre</a>, combined celebrity endorsement, interviews with housewives, product demonstration, animation, and a musical number led by the popular singer. <em><strong>Written by Fernando A.

These efforts were conceptualized to use radio as a tool for distance learning for farmers in far-flung areas. In 1952, a pioneering six-month education program for farmers in Iloilo was produced by Pacifico Sudario. Dubbed as the farmers&rsquo; school of-the-air, the program was sponsored by the Agricultural Productivity Commission and the Bureau of Plant Industry, and featured broadcasts on farming and community development (Flor 2009).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the 1960s, several AM stations started to include agriculture shows in their regular programming, usually in early morning time slots, and benefited from the support of institutions like the Department of Agriculture (DA), the University of the Philippines Los Ba&ntilde;os (UPLB), the International Institute for Rural Reconstruction, the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, and the International Rice Research Institute. In 1964, the rural educational radio station DZLB, operating under UPLB, went on the air for the first time after its conception in 1962 as an extension tool for disseminating agricultural information. Dubbed &ldquo;Ang Tinig ng Nayon&rdquo; (The Voice of the Countryside), DZLB has served as a rural education broadcasting platform for the propagation of agriculture-related information in the communities within and beyond the university (Gomez 1984). Still in operation, DZLB is considered one of the most significant projects realized in the field of agricultural extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The declaration of martial law in 1972 saw the government&rsquo;s transformation of mass media broadcasts into instruments for propagating New Society policies through what it termed as <b>development communication</b>. Operating within the ambit of the dictatorship&rsquo;s rural development framework, these programs occupied a significant place in the period&rsquo;s mass media landscape, particularly through their presence in radio broadcasting. Among the agriculture radio programs that aired under the dictatorship was <b><i>Sanggunian sa <strong>Himpapawid</strong></i></b> (Consultation on Air) anchored by Manila-based rural broadcasters of the government-owned DZFM. The program served as the model for one-hour farm broadcasts developed as part of the extensive communication campaign to promote Masagana 99, a national campaign for food sufficiency launched in 1973, which aimed at increasing the country&rsquo;s rice production (Alvarez 1984). Rural broadcasters enlisted by the Ministry of Agriculture to create and conduct these broadcasts received their training at DZLB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The realization of initiatives in community radio in the late 1980s, marked by the proposal of the Philippine Foundation of Rural Broadcasters and other academics to install radio stations in various remote areas in the country, paved the way for the creation of educational programming geared toward the needs of the locality. Agriculture segments prominently figured in these community radio broadcasts. For instance, DZJO of the Bayanihan Broadcasting Corporation based in Infanta, Quezon, features radio schools that provide information to barrio folks concerning issues like sustainable agriculture, environmental preservation, and livelihood (Tabing 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Agriculture programming eventually entered the television broadcasting platform during the 1970s, with radio maintaining a firm hold on its audiences. A popular example is <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4841\">Gerry Geronimo</a>&rsquo;s long-running <b><i>Ating Alamin</i></b><i> </i>(Let Us Find Out), 1974-91, revived in the late 2000s, and aired on different stations. Considered one of the earliest educational television programs for farmers, this weekly show presents various topics on agriculture, agribusiness, and even cockfighting in a magazine format that featured expert interviews and infographics in its presentation of information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the mid to the late 1970s, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4861\">Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster sa Pilipinas (KBP)</a> and the Broadcast Media Council (BMC) issued directives that mandated the compulsory radio broadcast of educational agriculture-based programs produced by the government, like the DA&rsquo;s <b><i>University of the Air</i></b>. However, the abolition of the BMC subsequently led to the reduction of farmcasting airtime from one hour to fifteen minutes (Flor 2009). Nevertheless, even in the absence of direct government promotion, the 1990s saw no decline in the emergence of agriculture-oriented television programs in commercial television networks. These programs continued to occupy the morning time slot. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4851\">IBC 13</a> aired <b><i>Mag-Agri Tayo</i></b><i> </i>(Let Us Do Agriculture), 1990, which was eventually transferred to and continues to be aired by the government-sponsored PTV 4, while the Technology and Livelihood Resource Center produced <b><i>Agrisiete</i></b><i> </i>(Agriculture on Seven), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4842\">GMA</a>, and featured experts from UPLB and the Department of Science and Technology. <b><i>Agrisiete </i></b>was also notable for having popular celebrity <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4909\">German Moreno</a> host the program in what could be understood as an effort to widen its appeal (Flor 2009).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A new brand of agriculture shows emerged in the late 1980s until the early 2000s, with agriculture programs being utilized by civil society groups experimenting on form and expanding the range of topics that can be covered by the genre. The weekly radio talk program <b><i>Punlaan sa Himpapawid</i></b> (Seedling Plots on Air), 1987 to late 1990s, on DWBC then on DWAN, produced by the Philippine Peasant Institute and anchored by Eli R. Guieb III, Faith Bacon, and later by Minda Casagan, discussed the sociopolitical context of agrarian reform and related peasant issues. A program which focused on fisheries and community-based coastal resource management and which combined talk, drama, music, and poetry was the daily radio magazine <b><i>Radyo Lundayan</i></b> (Lundayan Radio), DZEC, 1991-95, anchored by Guieb and Jingle Enriquez, joined in later by Casagan and Rom Dongeto, and produced by the Tambuyog Development Center.

Features devoted to breakthroughs in agricultural science have also been included even in weekly magazine and lifestyle shows like Korina Sanchez&rsquo;s <b><i>Rated K</i></b>, which premiered in 2004, ABS-CBN<i>.</i> Regional television networks also exemplify this practice of integrating agriculture segments in other programs. For instance, GMA Iloilo&rsquo;s now-defunct morning show <b><i>Arangkada</i></b> (Accelerate) featured the segment &ldquo;Agring-agri&rdquo;<i> </i>(Truly Agriculture), which covered updates on the agriculture sector and provided tips to farmers and to whomever was interested to engage in agribusiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even with the advent of online programming, agriculture programs continue to be aired on radio, as sophisticated communication technologies remain inaccessible to some rural communities.

Examples include the serialized westerns <b><i>The Wild, Wild West</i></b> and the adventure series <b><i>Tarzan</i></b> on ABS-CBN, war dramas like <b><i>Combat</i> </b>and detective programs like <b><i>Mission Impossible</i></b> on GMA, spy programs such as <b><i>The Saint</i></b> on RMN-IBC 13, and the mystery anthology <b><i>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i> </b>and the Japanese television series <b><i>The Samurai</i></b> on Channel 5. Importing canned action programs continued into the 1980s with westerns like <b><i>Alias Smith and Jones</i></b>, <b><i><strong>Bona</strong>nza</i></b>,<i> <b>Gunsmoke</b></i>, and <b><i>Lancer</i></b>, and police and detective shows like <b><i>Cannon</i></b>,<i> <b>Dan August</b></i>, <b><i>Hawaii Five-O</i></b>, and <b><i>The Mod Squad</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While the action genre gained greater success in films during the subsequent decades that marked the rise to superstardom of action film stars <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4603\">Fernando Poe Jr</a> and <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>J</strong></a></strong></strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\">oseph Estrada</a>, the action genre on television in the 1970s copied the martial arts cinema of the likes of Bruce Lee, such as <b><i>Bertong Dragon</i></b> (Berto the Dragon), 1979, GTV 4, played by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4744\"><strong>Ramon Zamora</strong></a></strong></strong> (<b><i>TV Times </i></b>1979). An attempt at detective drama on TV was <b><i>Bakit </i></b>(Why), 1978, IBC 13, directed by Tony Llenes (<i>TV Times</i> 1978). Some of the films of action stars eventually migrated to television through reruns and screenings, like <b><i>FPJ sa GMA</i></b><i> </i>(FPJ on GMA),<b> </b>which aired from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The contemporary boom in the production and consumption of local drama series further allowed the predominant deployment of action and adventure genre conventions on television. While the 1990s were marked by the eventual decline of the action movie genre, a number of drama series beginning in the 2000s made action sequences integral to their narratives. <b><i>Basta&rsquo;t Kasama Kita</i></b><i> </i>(As Long as I&rsquo;m with You), 2003, ABS-CBN, starring popular soap actor <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4673\"><strong>Judy Ann Santos</strong></a></strong></strong> and action film actor <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4583\"><strong>Robin Padilla</strong></a></strong></strong>, can be considered one of the earliest examples of what was dubbed as <b>action<i>-</i>serye</b>&mdash;a drama series that fully appropriates and absorbs the conventions and structure of the action genre. The narrative centers on Ambet Catindig (Padilla), a veteran NBI agent, and his rookie partner, Princess Gonzales (Santos), a young law graduate embarking on a search for her father, a former NBI agent, who mysteriously disappeared. They are given tasks of solving various cases under the NBI crime-busting Eagles squad. The series swiftly moves from case to case in weeklong episodes that brim with action-filled sequences ranging from fistfights to shoot-outs, while charting the deepening romantic involvement of the two leads. Another example is <b><i>Asian Treasures</i></b>, 2007, GMA, topbilled again by Padilla, this time with Angel Locsin. Weaving folkloric elements into historical fiction and the treasure hunt narrative, this primetime series follows the exploits of the lead characters as they embark on a search for the treasures of the legendary <i>datu</i> (chieftains) of Panay. As evident in these two action series, the presence of the female action hero is noticeably more pronounced, deviating from the typically male-centered narrative with which the action genre has been identified for so long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In spite of being dominated by macho men, the action genre in the Philippines showcased female characters as powerful leads in history-fantasy-action dramas.<i> <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1436\"><strong>Encantadia</strong></a></b> </i>(Fairlyland), 2005, GMA, topbilled by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4309\"><strong>Iza Calzado</strong></a></strong></strong>, Diana Zubiri, Sunshine Dizon, and Karylle Tatlonghari, tells a story of four <i>diwata</i> (goddesses) tasked to protect and keep the balance of four kingdoms in Encantadia. Although the characters can control the four elements of nature (earth, wind, fire, and water), the women characters fight best with their sword, dagger, and spear. Other shows that had female leads are <b><i>Krystala</i></b>, 2004, ABS-CBN, and <b><i>Amaya</i></b>, 2011, GMA.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_4\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Interestingly, the emergence and popularity of <b>fantaserye</b> (fantasy series) provided opportunity for the further deployment of action and adventure genre conventions, particularly in both the afternoon and primetime slots. Radio pioneered in this genre, the most popular of which is <b><i>Zimatar</i></b>, written by Pedro Tiangco, which started its run in the 1970s and went on air for two decades on DZRH. It is about a young prince searching for his lost mother and whose kingdom is threatened by a rival kingdom. On television, <b><i>Pintados</i></b> (Tattooed), 1999, GMA, regarded as the earliest fantasy series, foregrounds combat sequences in telling the adventures of five young characters who are enlisted to become members of a clandestine crime-fighting unit formed to protect humanity from the evil forces of the Philippine supernatural underworld. Another successful fantasy series in which action plays a significant part in the plot is <b><i>Mulawin</i></b>, 2004, GMA, which revolves around the war between two opposing factions of winged humans: the kindhearted Mulawin and the evil Ravena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A significant number of fantasy television shows, which commonly feature superheroes engaged in a series of battles against the evil creatures that populate Filipino folklore, are adaptations from other forms. After several big-screen adaptations, the famous Filipino komiks superheroine created by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\"><strong>Mars Ravelo</strong></a></strong></strong>, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong></i></b>, was adapted twice by GMA, featuring Angel Locsin in 2005 and Marian Rivera in 2009. <b><i>Darna</i></b> is the story of a young lady who, upon swallowing a magic stone, transforms into a heroine endowed with great strength and fighting skills that she uses to combat evil creatures. Another legendary Mars Ravelo superhero, <b><i>Captain Barbell</i></b>, was adapted by GMA Network in 2006. Incarnated in the big screen by action film actors Fernando Poe Jr and Ramon &ldquo;Bong&rdquo; Revilla Jr,<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1263\"><strong>Ang Panday</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(The Blacksmith), a komiks series created by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4312\"><strong>Carlo J. Caparas</strong></a></strong></strong> about a blacksmith who uses his magical sword to fight evil supernatural creatures, was first produced on television as an animation by Gerry Garcia in 1986 on RPN 9, then adapted for television by ABS-CBN in 2005. The story of the komiks hero <b><i>Palos</i></b><i> </i>(Eel), a secret agent armed with professional fighting skills who aims to avenge his mother&rsquo;s death, was loosely adapted for television by ABS-CBN in 2008. Some action-adventure series also took after action-adventure films. ABS-CBN, for instance, unveiled a series based on the fantasy adventure movies of action film star <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4626\"><strong>Ramon Revilla</strong></a></strong></strong> titled <b><i>Agimat: Ang Mga Alamat ni Ramon Revilla&nbsp;</i></b>(Amulet: The Legends of Ramon Revilla), which is about the adventures of different heroes who use the supernatural abilities bestowed upon them by their amulets to fight evil creatures. Following the traditions of the Filipino epic and similar to <b><i>Ang Panday</i></b> was <b><i>Juan de la Cruz</i></b>, 2013, ABS-CBN, starring <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4536\"><strong>Coco Martin</strong></a></strong></strong>, about an orphan boy, half-human, half-demon, who was brought up by a priest and is tasked to protect humanity from wicked nonhuman elements that threaten to dominate society.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_5\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some action series are also localized versions of foreign shows. An example is <b><i>Lupin</i></b>, 2007, GMA, a loose adaptation of the eponymous French crime fiction series, which was later adapted into a Japanese anime series. In this version, Lupin is a professional thief whose plan to leave a life of crime and settle down is foiled by the active machinations of his father who trained him in the art of theft. Another example is<i> <b>Zaido: Pulis Pangkalawakan</b></i> (Zaido: Space Police), GMA, a spin-off of the Japanese superhero series <b><i>Space Sheriff Shaider</i></b>, which centers on the alien-fighting adventures of armored space soldiers enlisted by the Galactic Force to protect the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Action genre conventions are also a staple in contemporary nonfantasy drama series, particularly with the integration of scenes of abduction, police rescue, gunfights, and fistfights. There are, however, contemporary series with a more pronounced link with the action genre than others. For instance, <b><i>Ang Utol Kong Hoodlum</i></b> (My Hoodlum Brother), 2011, TV5, the television remake of the 1991 blockbuster romantic action film of the same title, features mixed martial arts fight sequences in a story about a con artist who crosses paths with a sheltered heiress. <b><i>Huwag Ka Lang Mawawala</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Against All Odds</i></b>), 2013, ABS-CBN, starring Judy Ann Santos, weaves the theme of female empowerment with the narrative of a battered wife who decides to improve her fighting skills to take vengeance on her abusive husband. <b><i>Undercover</i></b>, 2013, TV5, follows the path to vengeance treaded by an investigator who is mysteriously abducted and tortured by unknown villains on his wedding day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">While action cinema has currently been making a slow revival in the independent film movement, television reruns of past Filipino action films and drama series that contain action elements have somehow assured the continued presence of the action genre in the popular cultural realm. Other than the pleasures offered by thrilling fight scenes and adrenaline-pumping physical combat sequences, the appeal of the action genre has been understood to lie precisely in the allegorical possibilities that it offers for the depiction of the violent struggles and triumphs of a people perpetually enduring and braving the assaults of social and political crises. <em><strong>Written by Laurence Marvin S.

While the 1990s were marked by the eventual decline of the action movie genre, a number of drama series beginning in the 2000s made action sequences integral to their narratives. <b><i>Basta&#x2019;t Kasama Kita</i></b><i> </i>(As Long as I&#x2019;m with You), 2003, ABS-CBN, starring popular soap actor <strong><strong><a href=\"/4/26/4673\"><strong>Judy Ann Santos</strong></a></strong></strong> and action film actor <strong><strong><a href=\"/4/26/4583\"><strong>Robin Padilla</strong></a></strong></strong>, can be considered one of the earliest examples of what was dubbed as <b>action<i>-</i>serye</b>&#x2014;a drama series that fully appropriates and absorbs the conventions and structure of the action genre. The narrative centers on Ambet Catindig (Padilla), a veteran NBI agent, and his rookie partner, Princess Gonzales (Santos), a young law graduate embarking on a search for her father, a former NBI agent, who mysteriously disappeared. They are given tasks of solving various cases under the NBI crime-busting Eagles squad. The series swiftly moves from case to case in weeklong episodes that brim with action-filled sequences ranging from fistfights to shoot-outs, while charting the deepening romantic involvement of the two leads. Another example is <b><i>Asian Treasures</i></b>, 2007, GMA, topbilled again by Padilla, this time with Angel Locsin. Weaving folkloric elements into historical fiction and the treasure hunt narrative, this primetime series follows the exploits of the lead characters as they embark on a search for the treasures of the legendary <i>datu</i> (chieftains) of Panay. As evident in these two action series, the presence of the female action hero is noticeably more pronounced, deviating from the typically male-centered narrative with which the action genre has been identified for so long."

Its application in Philippine television broadcast materials and programs is an offshoot of cartoon and comic illustrations commonly featured in local magazines, newspapers, and comic books as early as the 1920s. Foreign animation programs imported into the country, developments in technology in the 1960s, challenges offered by digital software in the 1990s, and the expansion of broadcast platforms in the 2000s have significantly informed the form and content of animation on Philippine television and related media. Animation in Philippine broadcasting comes in the form of advertising, opening, and closing credits in TV shows, special effects, full programs, and films.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A notable comic book illustrator, especially before and after World War II, was Jose Zabala Santos who illustrated comic characters, such as Titina, Lukas Malakas, Popoy, and Sianong Siano for <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4161\"><strong>Sampaguita</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b> and <b><i><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a></strong></strong></i></b> magazines. He pioneered the slice-of-life cartoon before <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3388\"><strong>Larry Alcala</strong></a></strong></strong> popularized the style (Orellana 2014). It was as a staff in the art department of the Manila Advertising Agency when he first ventured into animation as applied to commercial advertising. In 1955, while working on a project for the Philippine Manufacturing Company (PMC), now known as Procter &amp; Gamble, he and <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3735\"><strong>Francisco Reyes</strong></a></strong></strong>, also a comic artist, created the six-minute, 35 mm animated film&nbsp;<b><i>Juan Tamad </i></b>(Lazy Juan), intended to advertise Purico, a PMC product, but which was never shown in theaters or on television. But the very first Filipino animated cartoon on film that influenced animation on television was made in 1953 when cartoonist Larry Alcala did a black-and-white exercise in movement on regular 8 mm film of a girl jumping rope and a boy playing yo-yo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A figure in cartooning and animation who emerged in the mid-1960s was Zabala&rsquo;s nephew, Severino &ldquo;Nonoy&rdquo; Marcelo, who studied animation in New York. When he came back, Marcelo and Zabala were commissioned by presidential daughter Imee Marcos to create the 48-minute <b><i><strong>Tadhana</strong> </i></b>(Destiny), 1978, the first Filipino animated film-for-TV, which was based on the Philippine history book written by then president Ferdinand Marcos. <b><i>Tadhana</i></b><i> </i>was aired only once on RPN 9 on 21 Sep 1978, the sixth anniversary of the declaration of martial law. Imee&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s TV show <b><i>Kaluskos Musmos</i></b> (Kiddie Noise), 1978-89, RPN 9, featured in one of its episodes in Sep 1978 a teaser of <b><i>Tadhana</i></b>, which was the sequence of Magellan invading the Philippine islands using the tune of <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4224\"><strong>Yoyoy Villame</strong></a></strong></strong>&rsquo;s novelty song &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/934\">Magellan</a>.&rdquo; On 21 Sep 1979, RPN 9 aired a two-hour special, the animation version of the Iluko epic <b><i><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\">Biag ni <strong>Lam-ang</strong></a> </i></b>(Life of Lam-ang), written and co-directed by Marcelo with Salvii Casino.

It was the first Filipino television animated series. It was aired in the evening prime time, a deviation from the common morning or late afternoon programming for animation programs mostly coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. RPN 9 produced and aired two more animated series by Garcia from two Filipino comics novels by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\"><strong>Mars Ravelo</strong></a></strong></strong>: <b><i>Captain Barbel</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>first illustrated in 1963 by Jim Fernandez in <b><i>Pinoy <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1554\"><strong>Komiks</strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong></i></b>, first illustrated as <b><i>Varga</i></b> in 1947 by Ravelo himself in <b><i>Bulaklak Magazine</i></b>, and re-illustrated in 1950 by <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/17/3732\"><strong>Nestor Redondo</strong></a></strong></strong> in <b><i>Pilipino Komiks</i></b>.

This was followed by more stop-motion clay animation works for Sime Darby, Ramcar International, Consolidated Foods Corporation, Unilever, and the Central Bank, which were recognized in Ad Congresses, Araw Awards, Creative Guild Awards, and the Catholic Mass Media Awards (Alcazaren 2012). In 1993, their animated ad series for Pepsi won first prize in the HOW Magazine International Design Competition.

Its application in Philippine television broadcast materials and programs is an offshoot of cartoon and comic illustrations commonly featured in local magazines, newspapers, and comic books as early as the 1920s. Foreign animation programs imported into the country, developments in technology in the 1960s, challenges offered by digital software in the 1990s, and the expansion of broadcast platforms in the 2000s have significantly informed the form and content of animation on Philippine television and related media. Animation in Philippine broadcasting comes in the form of advertising, opening, and closing credits in TV shows, special effects, full programs, and films."

The segments of the magazine program highlighted music and theater, discussions on issues in arts and culture, and balagtasan on current sociopolitical issues. In 1990, the CCP Public Relations Division partnered with 98.7 DZFE to produce <em><strong>Culture Carousel</strong></em> hosted by Irene Rada. The weekly radio program features upcoming CCP music artists, interviews with members of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4125\">Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra</a> (PPO), and PPO recorded performances.

The CCP, in cooperation with the Alitaptap Storytellers Philippines, the Philippine Board on Books for Young People, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/8/4820\">DZAS</a> radio produced a 30-minute program titled <em><strong>Wan Dey, Isang Araw</strong></em> (One Day) from 2005 to 2013. The program, hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5329\">Luis&nbsp;Gatmaitan</a>, featured works in classical and contemporary Philippine children&rsquo;s literature that were considered outstanding, including stories written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3355\">Rene Villanueva</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2783\">Christine Bellen</a>, Gatmaitan, and Grace Chong. Despite its many awards, insufficient funding caused the production to fold up (Rada 2015; Tresvalles 2015).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><br />\r\nThe CCP also ventured into the production of TV programs to promote Philippine arts and culture. One of these was <em><strong>Pinoy Eh</strong></em>, a magazine show produced in 1990 and telecast over ABC 5. The show consisted of 13 episodes directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4409\">Marilou Diaz-Abaya</a> and hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3073\">Ces Quesada</a>. It discussed the Filipino language, music, cinema, architecture, literature, and dance. It also featured episodes on the Filipino observance of Christian rituals like Holy Week and Christmas, as well as on special topics like the Aeta ethnic group and the town of Angono (Sulicipan-Vibal 2015). Another CCP drama production for television was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1477\">Noli Me Tangere</a> (Touch Me Not), 1992, based on Jose Rizal&rsquo;s novel.

IBC 13 made a full-length Cooltura TV special to commemorate Philippine independence titled <em><strong>A Taste of History: Isang Malinamnam na Kalayaan</strong></em> (A Taste of History: A Delicious Freedom). The TV special, which aired in Jun 2012, explored the food&nbsp;preferences and culinary adventures of Filipino heroes and revolutionaries at the turn of the 20th century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Compared to commercial entertainment programs, there are but a handful of culture and art shows put up by commercial TV stations.

Responding to such a demand from viewers, ABS-CBN created programs on arts and culture. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1502\"><em><strong>Ryan, Ryan Musikahan</strong></em></a> (Music with Ryan) was a late-night show that featured guest musicians and singers from 1988 to 1995, with composer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3933\">Ryan Cayabyab</a> as host. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1420\"><em><strong>Caf&eacute; Bravo</strong></em></a> was a&nbsp;magazine show in Filipino produced in 1989, hosted by journalist Apa Ongpin, columnist Tweetums Gonzalez, and broadcast journalist Dave Celdran.

This type of show has generally been considered as educational and, as is usually the case in educational programming, less commercial. No such program in recent years has landed on prime time. It has increasingly been marginalized with the termination of such programs due to low audience ratings and the lack of support by institutions and advertisers.&nbsp;<strong><em>Written by Rosalie S.

Taking from earlier forms like the <i>duplo</i>, it involves a poetic joust between two poets who take opposing sides of an issue, with a mediator called <b>lakandiwa</b> if male and <b>lakambini</b> if female and a team of judges who select a winner. The issues debated on, often posed in the form of a question and a choice between two contrasting or conflicting alternatives, ranged from the political to the social and philosophical. It is a public display of wit, intelligence, eloquence, and poetic ability as well as an entertaining theatrical performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The first balagtasan was held on 6 Apr 1924 featuring three debates, from which <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a> aka Huseng Batute and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5180\">Florentino Collantes</a> aka Kuntil Butil emerged as winners and crowd favorites. They were hailed as the first kings of balagtasan as the form gained wide popularity. The verse debate became so famous that the Kapampangan created their own poetic joust called <b>crissotan</b>,<i> </i>in honor of their major writer <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3269\">Juan Crisostomo Soto</a>, while the Ilocano had <b>bucanegan</b>, after <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5134\"><strong>Pedro Bucaneg</strong></a></strong></strong>, who wrote the epic <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\">Biag ni Lam-ang</a> </i></b>(Life of Lam-ang).

Collantes, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5045\"><strong>Emilio Mar Antonio</strong></a></strong></strong>, Domingo Carasig, and Epifania Alvarez were frequent debaters (Jimenez 1996, 33B). In one episode, the poetic joust answered the question, &ldquo;Which affords greater pleasure: a married life or a life of singleness?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Balagtasan disappeared on radio during World War II.

Taking from earlier forms like the <i>duplo</i>, it involves a poetic joust between two poets who take opposing sides of an issue, with a mediator called <b>lakandiwa</b> if male and <b>lakambini</b> if female and a team of judges who select a winner. The issues debated on, often posed in the form of a question and a choice between two contrasting or conflicting alternatives, ranged from the political to the social and philosophical. It is a public display of wit, intelligence, eloquence, and poetic ability as well as an entertaining theatrical performance."

KZRM&rsquo;s <b><i>Newsreel of the Air</i></b> presented the news in drama form, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4973\"><strong>Francisco Trinidad</strong></a> and Lamberto Avellana dramatizing the news by impersonating the voices of important political personalities from around the world. In 1938, an early model of the Tagalog soap-opera-cum advice program, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1506\"><strong>Si Aling Juanang Mapag-impok</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(The Thrifty Madam Juana), hosted by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5296\"><strong>Lina Flor</strong></a></strong>, debuted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The genre called soap opera flourished after World War II. They were called soaps because the first such productions in the United States were sponsored by soap products. DZRH produced the first postwar soaps in 1949: <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1448\"><strong>Ilaw ng Tahanan</strong></a></i></b> (The Light of the Home), written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5458\"><strong>Liwayway</strong></a> Arceo, and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1441\"><strong>Gulong ng Palad</strong></a></i></b> (Wheel of Fortune) by Lina Flor. Both aired daily for 15 minutes and were about the highs and the lows in the lives of ordinary Filipino families and their friends. DZRH dominated the production of famous radio drama serials in the 1950s, such as <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1489\"><strong>Prinsipe Amante</strong></a></i></b> (Prince Amante), a <i>komedya</i>-type story written by Clodualdo del Mundo; <b><i>Ginang Hukom</i></b> (Mrs Judge), a legal drama by Lina Flor; and <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b> (A Night of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\"><strong>Horror</strong></a>), a horror drama. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5272\"><strong>Genoveva Edroza-Matute</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i>Aklat ng Pag-ibig</i></b> (Book of Love), also on DZRH, can be considered the first radio novel, a limited run of unique stories that lasted only months instead of the usual years of a typical melodrama. Other memorable soaps of the period include DZPI&rsquo;s child-oriented <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1471\"><strong>Mga Kuwento ni </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Basyang</strong></i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a> of Grandma Basyang), based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>&rsquo;s serial on <b><i>Liwayway</i></b> magazine, and Clodualdo del Mundo&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1496\"><strong>Recuerdo</strong></a></i></b> (Memento) and <b><i>Mercedes Cruz</i></b>; DZBB&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1519\"><strong>Tony Narra</strong></a></i></b>, which was the first detective type of narrative on Philippine radio, Gloria Villaraza-Guzman&rsquo;s love stories <b><i>Mga Lihim ng Puso</i></b> (Secrets of the Heart), and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1421\"><strong>Camay Theater of the Air</strong></a></i></b>, a Sunday-night, 60-minute reenactment of an upcoming Filipino movie, with the film actors coming to the studio and reenacting the movie dialogue live; DZBC&rsquo;s <b><i>Panata ng Puso</i></b> (Heart&rsquo;s Promise) and <b><i>Digmaan ng Damdamin</i></b> (Battle of Emotions), both written and directed by Artemio Marquez, and the horror drama <b><i>Sepulturero sa Lumang Libingan</i></b> (Undertaker in the Old Cemetery); and Fundador Soriano&rsquo;s <b><i>Kahapon Lamang</i></b> (Just Yesterday) and <b><i>Flordeluna</i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceto 1997; Enriquez 2003).

The soaps were either serials with no end in sight or short stories aired as the episode for the day. In the 1970s until the 1980s, from DWWW came <b><i>Maja Vida</i></b> (Pleasant Life) and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/913\"><strong>Kapantay ay Langit</strong></a></i></b> (As High as Heaven); from DZRH were <b><i>Kasaysayan ni Aida Nu&ntilde;ez</i></b> (The Story of Aida Nu&ntilde;ez), <b><i>True Confessions</i></b>, <b><i>Pinagpala</i></b> (Blessed), <b><i>Love Story</i></b>, and <b><i>Bukang-Liwayway sa Takipsilim</i></b> (Dawn at Dusk).

A hit melodrama that came out in 1973 and is still airing on DZRH is the daily soap <b><i>Ito ang Palad Ko</i></b> (This Is My Fate). The soaps of Radio Mindanao Network continued their popularity during the post-martial law period in Visayan-speaking audiences in the Visayas and Mindanao. Examples are <b><i>Kun Ako ang Pasultihon</i></b> (If I Were to Speak), an advice comedy drama; <b><i>Kini ang Akong Suliran</i></b> (This Is My Problem), which dramatizes legal and medical issues sent by listeners; and <b><i>Handumanan sa Usa ka Awit</i></b> (Memories of a Song), stories of love based on songs sent in by listeners (<b><i>Mindanao Examiner</i></b> 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_3\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">On television, the soap first appeared on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> through the horror drama <b><i>Hiwaga sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/220\"><strong>Bahay na Bato</strong></a></i></b> (Mystery at the House of Stone), 1963-64.

There seems to be no end in the stories in these soaps. They usually end when the program&rsquo;s popularity begins to wane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most melodrama anthologies on television are family-oriented or are about romantic love, are mainly focused on women, and feature women actors as the lead.

Prominent among these is <b><i>Balintataw</i></b> (The Mind&rsquo;s Eye), 1968-71, ABC-RTV5, which adapted award-winning Filipino novels, short stories, and stage plays for television.

Examples coming from civil society groups were the weekly anthologies on radio, such as <b><i>Pintig ng Konsyumer</i></b> (Pulse of the Consumer), DWXI, about consumers&rsquo; issues produced by the Citizens&rsquo; Alliance for Consumer Protection; <b><i>Punlaan sa <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1179\"><strong>Himpapawid</strong></a></i></b> (Seedling Plots on Air), 1987 to mid-1990s, on DWBC, then on DWAN, produced by the Philippine Peasant Institute, about peasant issues and agrarian reform; <b><i>Radyo Lundayan</i></b> (Lundayan Radio), DZEC, 1991-95, produced by the Tambuyog Development Center, about the political ecology of fisherfolk concerns; and <b><i>Pitlag!: Kuwento ng Buhay, Isyu ng Bayan</i></b> (Jolt!: Narratives of Life, Issues of Community and Nation), 2000-2006, first on Radio Veritas then on RMN, produced by Pathway Productions, about corruption issues that hounded the presidency of Estrada and other national issues like the social cost of the war in Mindanao, the struggles of indigenous peoples, the death penalty, and child labor. <b><i>Pitlag!</i></b> was the first radio drama program in the Philippines that won an award from the New York Festivals. On television, the Task Force Detainees of the Philippines produced <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1470\"><strong>Melinda</strong></a></i></b>, 1995, GMA, a single-airing drama about the rape of young student activists by the military; and the Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA) created <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/896\"><strong>Handog</strong></a> ng PETA</i></b> (An Offering of PETA), 1990-92, and <b><i>PETA-bisyon</i></b> (PETA Vision), 1993, PTV 4, then RPN 9 and ABC 5, which examined relevant sociopolitical issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The telenovela has become the most popular form of the drama beginning in the 2000s. The word comes from the Spanish words <i>televisi&oacute;n</i>, or the Portuguese <i>televisao</i>, and the Spanish and Portuguese word <i>novela.</i> In the Philippines, it is also called teleserye. A long story or a novel is watched in episodes, each lasting 30 minutes to one hour. The most popular telenovelas come from Latin American countries, such as Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, and Colombia. Telenovelas may be in the form of drama, fantasy, and action. Drama, however, is the usual fare. Melodrama, to be specific, is the usual format, wherein a happy ending caps the whole series of struggle and suffering of the main character or characters. A lead character, for example, or a star-crossed young couple, ends up in a happy wedding. The <i>kontrabida </i>(antagonist), who causes all the woes of the <i>bida</i> (protagonist), is jailed or dies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1970s, Mexico pioneered in airing highly popular telenovelas. Mexican telenovela produced a phenomenon in the Philippines with its show <b><i>Marimar</i></b>, 1996, RPN 9, starring Thalia. <b><i>Marimar</i></b> was so popular at the time that the world seemed to come to a temporary stop whenever it was shown on Philippine television. <b><i>Marimar</i> </b>has left its mark. Its most obvious influence on Philippine teleserye is in the use of crosscutting, where scenes simultaneously happen. It also changed the programming landscape of Philippine television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The early daily soaps in the Philippines can be considered telenovelas. Unlike current telenovelas, however, these drama serials spanned as long as they were rating and as long as there were sponsors. The current format of the telenovela, on the other hand, is a limited-run drama serial. The first telenovela in the Philippines with a limited-run format is <b><i>Malayo Pa ang Umaga</i></b> (The Morn Is Yet So Far), 1979, RPN 9, based on the novel <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1829\"><strong>Without Seeing the Dawn</strong></a></i></b>, 1947, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5400\"><strong>Stevan Javellana</strong></a> and produced by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4169\"><strong>Armida Siguion-Reyna</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">ABS-CBN contemporary blockbuster teleseryes include <b><i>Pangako sa &rsquo;Yo</i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>The Promise</i></b>), 2000; <b><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa_Dulo_Ng_Walang_Hanggan\"><span style=\"text-underline:none\">Sa Dulo ng Walang Hanggan</span></a></i> </b>(At Eternity&rsquo;s End), 2001-03; <b><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basta%27t_Kasama_Kita\"><span style=\"text-underline:none\">Basta&rsquo;t Kasama Kita</span></a></i></b><i> </i>(As Long as I&rsquo;m with You), 2003-04; <b><i>Sa Piling Mo </i></b>(With You), 2006; <b><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maging_Sino_Ka_Man\"><span style=\"text-underline:none\">Maging Sino Ka Man</span></a></i></b><i> </i>(Whoever You May Be), 2006-07; <b><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tayong_Dalawa\"><span style=\"text-underline:none\">Tayong Dalawa</span></a></i></b><i> </i>(The Two of Us), 2009; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1469\"><strong>May Bukas Pa</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(There&rsquo;s Still Tomorrow), 2009-10; <b><i>Magkaribal</i></b><i> </i>(Rivals), 2010; <b><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_Careful_With_My_Heart\"><span style=\"text-underline:none\">Be Careful with My Heart</span></a></i></b>, 2012-14; <b><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ina_Kapatid_Anak\"><span style=\"text-underline:none\">Ina, Kapatid, Anak</span></a></i></b><i> </i>(<b><i>Her Mother&rsquo;s Daughter</i></b>), 2012-13; and <b><i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legal_Wife\"><span style=\"text-underline:none\">The Legal Wife</span></a></i></b>, 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Very few are in the vein of comedy such as <b><i>Betty la Fea</i> </b>(Ugly Betty), 2007, GMA,<b> </b>or action/adventure like <b><i>Asian Treasures</i></b>, 2007, ABS-CBN,<i> </i>starring Angel Locsin and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4583\"><strong>Robin Padilla</strong></a>. Most are drama or melodrama. Most revolve around the family, dealing with the personal and with strong emotions.

The political drama <b><i>Sa Ngalan ng Ina</i></b> (In the Name of the Mother), 2011, TV5, starring Nora Aunor, reflects the dirty politics in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The multi-awarded actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4536\"><strong>Coco Martin</strong></a>, dubbed the &ldquo;prince of telenovelas,&rdquo; starred in famous teleseryes on ABS-CBN, such as <b><i>Minsan Lang Kita Iibigin</i></b><i> </i>(I Will Love You Only Once), 2011;<i> <b>Walang Hanggan</b> </i>(<b><i>My Eternal</i></b>), 2012,<i> </i>a remake of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4681\"><strong>Carlos Siguion-Reyna</strong></a>&rsquo;s movie <b><i>Hihintayin Kita sa Langit</i></b><i> </i>(I Will Wait for You in Heaven); <b><i>Ikaw Lamang</i></b> (<b><i>No Greater Love</i></b>), 2014; and <b><i>FPJ&rsquo;s Ang Probinsyano</i></b> (FPJ&rsquo;s The Country Boy), starting in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Telenovelas have also given rise to a &ldquo;new image&rdquo; of the modern woman. The female kontrabida appears to be a more rounded character, more alive, more intelligent and witty, and more interesting than the trite and boring goody-goody bida. For this reason, young female viewers tend to identify themselves with the kontrabida. Most telenovelas, of course, have the stamp of escapism.<em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5436\"><strong>Marra PL.

They are produced by an organization or an individual that adhere to a particular religion. They air on the organization&rsquo;s own network or are programmed by commercial stations as blocktimers. Early and contemporary programs of this type operated not for profit but for evangelization. These shows would later on take a more public service orientation. Recent faith-based programs, however, have creatively combined commerce and religion into their formats. In the Philippines, faith-based programs fall under several types and formats, such as evangelism, the devotionals, talk-public affairs, counseling, public service, news, music, variety, children&rsquo;s show, and drama. Groups produce and air these programs in stations they own, or buy airtime as blocktimers in commercial or in government-run broadcast networks. In many cases, nonreligious stations themselves produce these shows, and many of these shows are now on electronic media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The earliest radio station that propagated the owners&rsquo; brand of faith was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4820\"><strong>DZAS</strong></a>, 1948, on KZAS 680 kHz, later 702 DZAS, under the then newly established Protestant Far Eastern Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>. The Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) established the Eagle Broadcasting Corporation in 1968 and began its broadcasts on DZEC. The Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines tapped radio for evangelization beginning only in 1969 when it began operations of DWRV Radio Veritas. The government of Ferdinand Marcos during martial law did not seem to be too strict on these stations. Maintaining good relations with established religious groups made it easier for Marcos to run the nation under an authoritarian regime. Immediately following the ouster of Marcos through the EDSA Revolt in 1986, ownership of the new free TV network, VHF station Channel 11, was contested by two religious charismatic groups: the Jesus Is Lord Movement (JIL) of Brother Eddie Villanueva and the El Shaddai of Brother <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4217\"><strong>Mike Velarde</strong></a>. Through the years, religious programs paved the way for either the propagation of new faith or the strengthening of their respective religions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Faith-based programs on television during martial law were imported canned shows programmed during Sundays, and later in the daily evening time slot. Examples were <b><i>The 700 Club</i></b> and <b><i>The Rev. Ernest Angley Hour</i></b>, both on GMA 7; <b><i>Rex Humbard World Outreach Ministry</i></b>, <b><i>Jimmy Swaggart</i></b>, and <b><i>The Baptist Hour</i></b>, on IBC 13; and <b><i>Gospel Crusade</i></b> on GTV 4, which also aired the local program <b><i>The Sunday Mass</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1980s saw the more pronounced incursion of religious groups into both radio and television to reach a wider audience. Among them are The Lord&rsquo;s Flock of Fr Sonny Ramirez, the JIL of Villanueva, the El Shaddai of Velarde, the 700 Club of Pat Robertson, and the Iglesia ni Cristo. Their programs on television combine preaching, testimonies of religious experiences, inspirational music, masses, the recitation of the rosary for Catholics, and healing sessions. There are religious programs on the Eternal World Television Network, such as the popular talk show of Mother Angelica (Panopio and Santico-Rolda 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Evangelization shows that persuade non-adherents to convert run on religious stations operated by the groups themselves.

They air on the organization&#x2019;s own network or are programmed by commercial stations as blocktimers. Early and contemporary programs of this type operated not for profit but for evangelization. These shows would later on take a more public service orientation. Recent faith-based programs, however, have creatively combined commerce and religion into their formats. In the Philippines, faith-based programs fall under several types and formats, such as evangelism, the devotionals, talk-public affairs, counseling, public service, news, music, variety, children&#x2019;s show, and drama. Groups produce and air these programs in stations they own, or buy airtime as blocktimers in commercial or in government-run broadcast networks. In many cases, nonreligious stations themselves produce these shows, and many of these shows are now on electronic media."

The Iglesia ni Cristo (INC) established the Eagle Broadcasting Corporation in 1968 and began its broadcasts on DZEC. The Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines tapped radio for evangelization beginning only in 1969 when it began operations of DWRV Radio Veritas. The government of Ferdinand Marcos during martial law did not seem to be too strict on these stations. Maintaining good relations with established religious groups made it easier for Marcos to run the nation under an authoritarian regime. Immediately following the ouster of Marcos through the EDSA Revolt in 1986, ownership of the new free TV network, VHF station Channel 11, was contested by two religious charismatic groups: the Jesus Is Lord Movement (JIL) of Brother Eddie Villanueva and the El Shaddai of Brother <a href=\"/5/42/4217\"><strong>Mike Velarde</strong></a>. Through the years, religious programs paved the way for either the propagation of new faith or the strengthening of their respective religions."

They are often in <b>educational magazine talk shows</b> and <b>public service programs</b>, and usually have an interview segment of an expert. <b>Lifestyle </b>and<b> game shows</b> are recently emerging as health programs that promote healthy living and are secondarily educational in nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In a country with a severe lack of adequate and accessible health care, the media in the Philippines has played an important role as auxiliary informative tools to the existing, albeit meager and unevenly developed, health-care system. Frequently produced on broadcast radio channels, these shows are able to reach underdeveloped areas and marginalized sectors in the Philippines and serve as access points for poor Filipinos to seek free medical help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A pioneer of the health program format, but for an entirely political purpose, was <b><i>Rajio Taiso</i></b>, a 15-minute calisthenics program on KZRH during the Japanese occupation. The station signed on at 7:55 am with this program beginning not later than Oct 1942. The program was repeated at noon. Government employees and schoolchildren were required to tune in to the program so they could follow the exercise commands of the odd unseen instructor. The physical exercise program, for some historians, was the station&rsquo;s way to push forward the &ldquo;Japanization&rdquo; of Filipinos, best expressed through obedience to an invisible authority (<b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1308\"><strong>Tribu</strong></a>ne</i></b> 1942, 1943; Ampil 1986; Jose 1992).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Health programs gained prominence only in the 1970s, mainly in the form of public service programs. On radio, DZRH launched the program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tion Tulong </i></b>(Operation Assistance), 1979, which aired from midnight until 2:00 am and was hosted by Manny Calpito, who interviewed on air and assisted people in need of medical care and all sorts of immediate help. Financial and other forms of support come from the listeners, not from government and corporations. On television, health shows in the form of public service were aired in the late afternoon programming, such as the charity shows <b><i>Damayan </i></b>(Helping <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Another), 1976, GTV 4, with film actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4651\"><strong>Rosal Rosa</strong></a>l calling on various organizations to help alleviate the plight of indigent people going to the program to seek help, and <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko </i></b>(I Love My Fellowman), 1974, GMA 7, with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4904\"><strong>Orly Mercado</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4264\"><strong>Boots Anson</strong></a>-Roa, Cielito del Mundo, and kidney specialist Dr Antonio Talusan helping those who need medical attention. <b><i>Kapwa Ko, Mahal Ko</i> </b>is the first program to feature volunteer sign-language interpreters from the Philippine School for the Deaf on a portion of the TV monitor. Rosal would also become one of <b><i>Kapwa Ko</i></b>&rsquo;s regular hosts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">An indicator of the Filipinos&rsquo; need for medical education and accessible health services was the rise to prominence of John <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/689\"><strong>William</strong></a> Joseph Y. Xerez-Burgos Jr, known as Johnny Midnight, a pioneer reporter for <b><i>Radyo Patrol </i></b>in the 1960s. He set up a radio show aired from midnight to 2:00 am on DZBB that dispensed health tips enfolded in religious rhetoric. In 1981, a healing segment was inserted into his radio program.

A fantasy program draws out wonder or amazement by tackling phenomena beyond ordinary and mundane reality. The combination of the two genres is a reliable formula to hold the sustained interest of radio and TV audiences. This penchant for horror and fantasy has a deeper basis. Filipino cosmology from precolonial times to the present consists of realms populated by otherworldly beings. These entities are gods, goddesses, fairies or <i>encantada</i>, ethereal fetus snatchers or the <i>manananggal</i>, shape-shifting witches called the <i>aswang</i>, and nature spirits like the <i>kapre </i>or giant, <i>duwende</i> or elf, and <i>tikbalang </i>or horselike creature<i>. </i>Our folklore abounds with mythical creatures like winged serpents and giant birds. Filipino consciousness embraces belief in the afterlife, which makes ghosts and wandering spirits part of reality. Our literature is replete with epic heroes like Aliguyon, Bantugan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1891\"><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a> who all possess incredible powers that rival those of Superman or the X-Men.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">No wonder then that <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\"><strong>Severino Reyes</strong></a>&rsquo;s <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1471\"><strong>Mga Kuwento ni </strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1215\"><strong>Lola</strong></a> Basyang</strong></i></b> (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/79/2065\"><strong>Stories</strong></a> of Grandma Basyang), about fantastic tales in Philippine folklore, has been told and retold in literature, theater, film, radio, and television. In the 1950s, <b><i><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/612\"><strong>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</strong></a></strong></i></b> was serialized into a DZRH radio drama with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4830\"><strong>Luz Fernandez</strong></a> as Lola Basyang. Due to the unfading popularity of the long-running radio drama, it was made into a movie in 1985 with comic actor <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4784\"><strong>Chichay</strong></a> in the title role. Then in 2007-08, GMA Network produced <b><i>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang </i></b>with storyteller Manilyn Reynes as the granddaughter of Lola Basyang. In 2008, DZRH again produced <b><i>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</i></b> into a special radio drama trilogy still with Luz Fernandez as Lola Basyang (Socorro 2011; Gonzales 2007).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Also in the 1950s, DZRH aired <b><i>Kapitan Kidlat</i></b> (Captain Lightning), a radio drama about a discreet man who was given fantastic powers by the god Zeus to fight crime. The popularity of the radio program led to a film of the same title with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4463\"><strong>Armando Goyena</strong></a> as Kapitan Kidlat in 1953. Another popular radio program then was <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim </i></b>(Night of Terror). The program was heralded by the creepy howling of a dog, the demonic voice of Mike Perez announcing &ldquo;<i>Ito ang gabi ng lagim!</i>&rdquo; (This is the night of terror!), and the screams of a woman over the sinister laughter of Perez. Due to its tremendous popularity, <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim</i></b> was made into a film in 1960 and was subsequently produced as a TV series on MBC 11. Many decades later, the spine-chilling voice of Mike Perez is still used to scare carnival thrill-seekers in Star City&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1067\"><strong>Horror</strong></a> House (DZRH 2014; Cruz 2014; Dalisay 2013; <i>Komixrama</i> 2011). After a long absence, <b><i>Gabi ng Lagim </i></b>is back on the air weeknights on DZRH (Benjamin 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A suspense-horror series in 1972 was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/937\"><strong>Malikmata</strong></a></i></b> (Illusion) over ABC 5 in 1972. First directed by Lupita Concio and then by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4303\"><strong>Lino Brocka</strong></a>, the episodes presented chilling stories like cannibalism and communicating with spirits through the Ouija board. The modern treatment of the horror genre, sometimes with camp or with quiet fear, was gaining viewership for <b><i>Malikmata </i></b>when TV stations closed with the declaration of martial law in Sep 1972 (veroli1974 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Situational comedies</b> or <b>sitcom</b> became popular in the 1980s. A new approach was to marry fantasy and comedy as shown in the Okay Ka, Fairy Ko! (You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy!) series that became a big hit for 10 years. The first cast was composed of Vic Sotto as Enteng the human husband, Alice Dixson as Faye the fairy wife, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4959\"><strong>Aiza Seguerra</strong></a> as the crossbreed daughter, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4688\"><strong>Charito Solis</strong></a> as the fairy grandmother. <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!</i></b> ran in 1987-89 on IBC 13, then on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> in 1989-95, and then on GMA 7 in 1996-97. The story revolved around the problems of a marriage between an ordinary human and a fairy princess. Two films with the same title based on the TV sitcom became box-office hits in the early 1990s (Retro Pilipinas 2012).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">TV primetime programming in the 1980s also saw the development of gruesome horror series, like Regal Television&rsquo;s <b><i>Regal Shockers</i></b>, 1985-91. The drama anthology was meant to terrify audiences with gore, violence, and dark terror. However, it gradually lost the support of advertisers due to its perceived negative effect, especially on minors. In an effort to depart from the ghastly treatment of the horror genre, MAQ Productions, a subsidiary of Regal Television, launched <b><i>Lihim<em> ng Gabi</em></i></b>(Secrets of the Night) in 1996-97 over GMA Network. The show pioneered in the mixed format of documentary and dramatic feature that present real people telling their supernatural experiences with commentaries from paranormal experts or researchers. Episodes included real-life stories on reincarnation, extraterrestrials, <i>kulam</i> or hex, <i>gayuma</i> or magic love potion, haunted house, near-death experience, and being possessed by spirits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To conquer children&rsquo;s viewership, ABS-CBN created its own long-running fantasy program, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1524\"><strong>Wansapanataym</strong></a></i></b>, premiered in 1997. The anthology is patterned after <b><i>Mga Kuwento ni Lola Basyang</i></b> and western fairy tales. It utilizes digital computer graphics and prosthetics to create a more modern look. Famous stars are billed with child actors to portray roles like kings, queens, fairies, elves, genies, and witches.

An extension of the anthology called <b><i>Nginig: The Hidden Files</i></b> was aired over Studio 23 hosted by hip-hop dancers Spencer Reyes, Jhong Hilario, Danilo Barrios, and Nico Manalo (ABS-CBN Interface 2004; ABS-CBN wikis).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The importance of the fantasy genre is demonstrated by the fact that GMA Network unseated ABS-CBN as top-rating network through the fantasy drama series that was repackaged as <b>fantaserye</b> or <b>telefantasya</b><i> </i>(fantasy series). The fantaserye capitalizes on grand production design, bizarre prosthetics, and digital imaging. GMA Network was able to achieve ratings supremacy first through <b><i>Mulawin</i></b>, 2004, about creatures who were half-human and half-bird, featuring the love team of Angel Locsin and Richard Gutierrez. The success of <b><i>Mulawin </i></b>prompted GMA Network to produce its film version in 2005. GMA Network also produced the expensive fantaserye <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1436\"><strong>Encantadia</strong></a> </i></b>(Fairyland), 2005, which portrayed the power struggles in a world of fairies, warriors, and mythical creatures divided into four kingdoms representing water, earth, wind, and fire. The sustained victory in the fantaserye ratings encouraged GMA Network to adapt <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5623\"><strong>Mars Ravelo</strong></a>&rsquo;s <i>komiks</i> characters like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1156\"><strong>Dyesebel</strong></a> the mermaid and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1148\"><strong>Darna</strong></a></strong> the celestial heroine. Marian Rivera&rsquo;s <b><i>Dyesebel</i></b>, 2008, and <b><i>Darna</i></b>, 2009,<i> </i>were great hits. But it was Angel Locsin&rsquo;s previous <b><i>Darna</i></b>, 2005, that reached a record high of 52.1 rating when Locsin first wore the Darna attire in the series (Philippine <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong> Series 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Determined to regain its position as the top TV station, ABS-CBN lured Locsin to transfer to its camp. She was immediately given her own two-part series, paired with leading ABS-CBN actors <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4590\"><strong>Piolo Pascual</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4352\"><strong>John Lloyd Cruz</strong></a>.

Both fantasy-horror series were derivatives of Hollywood movies, like <b><i>Underworld</i></b>, 2003, and <b><i>Twilight</i></b>, 2008, that deal with the gothic world of vampires and werewolves (Santiago 2009; <b><i>IMDb</i></b> 2014a; Mendoza 2009; Philippine Drama Series 2010).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Even the news and public affairs department of broadcast networks capitalize on horror and fantasy. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the favorite topics is tracking down ghosts in the infamous Manila Film Center (MFC) building that collapsed in 1981, allegedly burying hundreds of workers.

The combination of the two genres is a reliable formula to hold the sustained interest of radio and TV audiences. This penchant for horror and fantasy has a deeper basis. Filipino cosmology from precolonial times to the present consists of realms populated by otherworldly beings. These entities are gods, goddesses, fairies or <i>encantada</i>, ethereal fetus snatchers or the <i>manananggal</i>, shape-shifting witches called the <i>aswang</i>, and nature spirits like the <i>kapre </i>or giant, <i>duwende</i> or elf, and <i>tikbalang </i>or horselike creature<i>. </i>Our folklore abounds with mythical creatures like winged serpents and giant birds. Filipino consciousness embraces belief in the afterlife, which makes ghosts and wandering spirits part of reality. Our literature is replete with epic heroes like Aliguyon, Bantugan, <a href=\"/9/78/1891\"><strong>Labaw Donggon</strong></a>, and <a href=\"/9/78/1893\"><strong>Lam-ang</strong></a> who all possess incredible powers that rival those of Superman or the X-Men."

A sitcom has a predictable plot: someone makes a mistake, the error puts the characters in unexpected situations, the mistake is discovered at the end, and the characters patch things up. A gag show is a mixed bag of sketches, spoofs, and music that parodies human foibles, plays practical jokes about everyday life, caricatures products and services, or critiques sociopolitical issues and personalities. In stand-up comedy, a performer recites a monologue or performs an act in humorous ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The sitcom follows various formats. The straight narrative, some slapstick in rendition and with themes focusing on family and friends, is the most common, such as <b><i>Tang-Tarang-Tang </i></b>(a play on &ldquo;Tatang,&rdquo; a variant of the term for a male parent), about a dysfunctional Filipino family and its patriarch, which started in the 1950s on KZRH and became a popular show in the late 1960s until the 1970s on Channel 3; <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1453\"><strong>John en Marsha</strong></a> </i></b>(John and Marsha), 1973-90, RPN 9, about a poor family&rsquo;s hilarious responses to its social condition; <b><i>Iskul Bukol</i></b> (School Bumps), 1977-90, IBC 13, about a bunch of lazy, ambition-less students making fun of people around them; <b><i>Hapi House</i></b> (Happy House), 1987-88, IBC 13, which showed the oddities, ironies, and awkward moments of a typical Filipino family; <b><i>Buddy en Sol</i></b> (Buddy and Sol), 1991-93, RPN 9, about friendships and loyalties in the midst of conflicts; and <b><i>Pepito Manaloto</i></b>, which premiered in 2010, GMA, about the funny daily experiences of an instant-millionaire family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some comedy programs are infused with fantasy, such as <b><i>Okay Ka, Fairy Ko!</i></b> (You&rsquo;re Okay, My Fairy!), 1987-97, first on IBC 13, then <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>, and GMA, about the marriage of a human being and a supernatural, and <b><i>Vampire ang Daddy Ko</i></b> (My Daddy Is a Vampire), which premiered in 2013, GMA, about the battle between good and evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some sitcoms carry a political tone that comment on Filipino manners, politics, customs, and government.

Similar sitcoms are <b><i>Barrio Balimbing</i></b><i> </i>(Barrio of Turncoats), 1986 on IBC 13, then 1987-88 on ABS-CBN, about ordinary people&rsquo;s perception of political and social issues; and <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1401\"><strong>Abangan ang Susunod na Kabanata</strong></a> </i></b>(Watch for the Next Chapter), 1991-97, ABS-CBN, about the peccadilloes of a morally depraved elite family foisting their whims on the rest of society as other people imitate, repel, fight, praise, and hobnob with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Lately, the comedy forms part of light romance stories, called the <b>rom-com</b>, although this format is often used in films than in broadcast. The comedic sequences, however, recede at some point of the narrative to give way to the more dramatic moments of the show, but ends in a light, positive mood. An example is the telenovela <b><i>Kahit Konting Pagtingin</i></b> (Just <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> Glance), 2013, ABS-CBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early gag shows were features of the variety show, the earliest of which was de la Costa&rsquo;s <b><i>Common Weal Hour</i></b> in the 1930s on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a>.

The cases brought before the hosts for legal opinion include wills and inheritance, quarrels and disagreements among relatives, unfaithful spouses, and unpaid lease rentals. Real names of callers are kept confidential. The more well-known examples are <b><i>Compa&ntilde;ero y Compa&ntilde;era</i></b> (in Spanish, male colleague and female colleague), which aired on DZMM from 1994 until it moved to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> in 1997, then to GMA Network in 1998, and to RPN 9 in 2000 until 2001. It was hosted by lawyer and later senator Renato Cayetano with Gel Relos while on DZMM and Channel 2. On the air on DZMM since 1996 is <b><i>Usapang de Campanilla</i></b> (referring to discourse between prominent lawyers), hosted by lawyer Danilo Concepcion. Another lawyer, Mel Sta. Maria, gives legal advice in the radio program <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1271\"><strong>Relasyon</strong></a></i></b> (Relations) on Radyo5 and &ldquo;Makatarungan Ba?&rdquo; (Is it Just?), a segment on TV5&rsquo;s news program <b><i>Aksyon</i></b> (Action). On Channel 11 from 1992 to 1996, lawyer Joji Antonio-Alonso hosted <b><i>The Police Hour</i></b> every midnight. She has been hosting the <b><i>Legal Forum</i></b> on the same channel since 1994, daily for 15 minutes. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the latest legal advice programs to go on air is <b><i>Legal Help Desk</i></b> on CNN Philippines Channel 9, since 2012, hosted by lawyer Karen Jimeno.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Radio has so far produced only one legal drama, <b><i>Ginang Hukom</i></b> (Madame Judge) on DZRH in the 1950s, based on cases decided by Philippine courts. When television began showing courtroom drama and other legal drama subgenres, such as crime investigation, beginning also in the 1950s, no other similar radio show followed <b><i>Ginang Hukom</i></b>. On television, actual legal cases are dramatized on <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1449\"><strong>Ipaglaban Mo</strong></a></i></b> (Fight for It), since 1988 on IBC Channel 13, GMA Channel 7, and ABS-CBN, hosted by lawyer Jose Sison. This program inspired two movies, <b><i>Ipaglaban Mo: The Movie </i></b>(<b><i>Redeem Her Honor</i></b>), 1995, directed by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4409\"><strong>Marilou Diaz-Abaya</strong></a>, and <b><i>Ipaglaban Mo: The Movie II </i></b>(Fight for It: The Movie 2), 1997, directed by Rory B. Quintos. Another program that dramatized actual legal cases was <b><i>Calvento Files</i></b>, 1995-98, ABS-CBN, which was also produced into a movie, <b><i>Calvento Files: The Movie</i></b>, 1997, directed by Lauren Dyogi and Michael de Mesa. Other legal dramas include <b><i>Scene of the Crime <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tives (S.O.C.O.)</i></b>, 2005-11, DZMM TeleRadyo; <b><i>Crime Klasik</i></b> (Crime Classic), since 2012, Aksyon TV; <b><i>Dahil May Isang Ikaw</i></b> (Because There Is One You), 2009-10, ABS-CBN; and <b><i>Case Unclosed</i></b>, 2008-10, GMA Network. A real-life drama that unfolds live before a studio audience is <b><i>Public Atorni: Asunto o Areglo?</i></b> (Public Attorney: Lawsuit or Amicable Settlement?), 2010, on TV5, where lawyer Persida Rueda-Acosta arbitrates disputes over small claims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Given the high-profile depiction of lawyers and the exciting portrayal of courtroom combat and crime investigations, legal dramas and legal advice programs are expected to endure on the air, with the courts providing an almost inexhaustible file of actual cases to a mesmerized audience. <em><strong>Written by Victor C.

The more well-known examples are <b><i>Compa&#xF1;ero y Compa&#xF1;era</i></b> (in Spanish, male colleague and female colleague), which aired on DZMM from 1994 until it moved to <a href=\"/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> in 1997, then to GMA Network in 1998, and to RPN 9 in 2000 until 2001. It was hosted by lawyer and later senator Renato Cayetano with Gel Relos while on DZMM and Channel 2. On the air on DZMM since 1996 is <b><i>Usapang de Campanilla</i></b> (referring to discourse between prominent lawyers), hosted by lawyer Danilo Concepcion. Another lawyer, Mel Sta. Maria, gives legal advice in the radio program <b><i><a href=\"/4/24/1271\"><strong>Relasyon</strong></a></i></b> (Relations) on Radyo5 and &#x201C;Makatarungan Ba?&#x201D; (Is it Just?), a segment on TV5&#x2019;s news program <b><i>Aksyon</i></b> (Action). On Channel 11 from 1992 to 1996, lawyer Joji Antonio-Alonso hosted <b><i>The Police Hour</i></b> every midnight. She has been hosting the <b><i>Legal Forum</i></b> on the same channel since 1994, daily for 15 minutes. <a href=\"/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the latest legal advice programs to go on air is <b><i>Legal Help Desk</i></b> on CNN Philippines Channel 9, since 2012, hosted by lawyer Karen Jimeno."

When television began showing courtroom drama and other legal drama subgenres, such as crime investigation, beginning also in the 1950s, no other similar radio show followed <b><i>Ginang Hukom</i></b>. On television, actual legal cases are dramatized on <b><i><a href=\"/8/67/1449\"><strong>Ipaglaban Mo</strong></a></i></b> (Fight for It), since 1988 on IBC Channel 13, GMA Channel 7, and ABS-CBN, hosted by lawyer Jose Sison. This program inspired two movies, <b><i>Ipaglaban Mo: The Movie </i></b>(<b><i>Redeem Her Honor</i></b>), 1995, directed by <a href=\"/4/26/4409\"><strong>Marilou Diaz-Abaya</strong></a>, and <b><i>Ipaglaban Mo: The Movie II </i></b>(Fight for It: The Movie 2), 1997, directed by Rory B. Quintos. Another program that dramatized actual legal cases was <b><i>Calvento Files</i></b>, 1995-98, ABS-CBN, which was also produced into a movie, <b><i>Calvento Files: The Movie</i></b>, 1997, directed by Lauren Dyogi and Michael de Mesa. Other legal dramas include <b><i>Scene of the Crime <a href=\"/5/35/786\"><strong>Opera</strong></a>tives (S.O.C.O.)</i></b>, 2005-11, DZMM TeleRadyo; <b><i>Crime Klasik</i></b> (Crime Classic), since 2012, Aksyon TV; <b><i>Dahil May Isang Ikaw</i></b> (Because There Is One You), 2009-10, ABS-CBN; and <b><i>Case Unclosed</i></b>, 2008-10, GMA Network. A real-life drama that unfolds live before a studio audience is <b><i>Public Atorni: Asunto o Areglo?</i></b> (Public Attorney: Lawsuit or Amicable Settlement?), 2010, on TV5, where lawyer Persida Rueda-Acosta arbitrates disputes over small claims."

Other networks that also aired music videos in the Philippines were Channel [V] Philippines, 1994-2011, MYX, beginning in 2001, and UNTV, 2001-04, counterpart of the FM rock radio station NU 107.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Initial MTV programming were countdowns of the top music videos, adopted from FM radio stations. A rotating cast of video jockeys (VJs), instead of disc jockeys (DJs), hosts these charts that factor in airplays and album sales. Francis Magalona, &ldquo;King of Pinoy Rap,&rdquo; was the first Filipino VJ on MTV Asia.

Among MTV&rsquo;s animated shows seen in the Philippines were the claymation <b><i>Celebrity Deathmatch</i></b>, where stars of the international music industry fight to the death in a wrestling ring; and <b><i>Beavis and Butthead</i></b>, where the two eponymous teenagers comment and watch music videos, often making fun of them.

Francis &ldquo;Brew&rdquo; Reyes of rock band <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3957\"><strong>The Dawn</strong></a> hosted the TV show and its corresponding radio show on NU 107, featuring demos and sessions of unsigned bands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Early music video performances were TV guestings in the 1980s.

In the said online platform, Tower of Doom has been uploading episodes of <b><i>Tower Sessions</i></b> featuring performing live bands from different music genres. Most &ldquo;official&rdquo; music videos, however, show band members in cinematic shots from different camera angles. Others insert fragments to compose stories and invoke collective tributary memories of musical influences such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4147\"><strong>Rivermaya</strong></a>&rsquo;s cover of punk band legend The Wuds&rsquo;s &ldquo;Inosente Lang ang Nagtataka&rdquo; (Only the Innocent Wonders) and Kamikazee&rsquo;s rendition of master rapper Francis M&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meron Akong Ano&rdquo; (I Have What), featuring Ian <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/105\"><strong>Tayao</strong></a> of Queso, Chito Miranda of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4114\"><strong>Parokya ni Edgar</strong></a>, and Reg Rubio of Greyhoundz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some videos reference popular culture. Sandwich&rsquo;s &ldquo;Betamax&rdquo; triggers nostalgia of the 1980s and the 1990s, as suggested by the title. As the song prompts images from these decades when &ldquo;there was no MTV yet,&rdquo; the footage shows children playing Filipino street games such as <i>piko</i> (hopscotch) and <i>tumbang preso </i>(knock the can down). While Kiko Machine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Takeshi&rsquo;s Castle&rdquo; explicitly reminds us of the imported Japanese TV game show, Up Dharma Down&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sana&rdquo; (Hopefully) mishmashes the said show with the Atari video games. Two of Wolfgang&rsquo;s music videos were soundtracks to video games: &ldquo;No Falter&rdquo; for the film adaptation of the <b><i>Final Fantasy</i></b><i> </i>franchise and<i> </i>&ldquo;Novus Is Burning&rdquo; for LevelUp!, both of which employ 3D graphics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Beyond recorded footage, some artists push the boundaries of the music video and use animation techniques, such as 3D animation in &ldquo;Tumatakbo&rdquo; (Running) by pop rock band Mojofly; stop-motion in <b><i>Mottaka</i></b> by metal band Queso, formerly Cheese; stylized vector-like flash animation in &ldquo;Quick to Panic&rdquo; by Cebu-based indie band Sheila and the Insects; and rotoscoping in &ldquo;Dream Systems&rdquo; by The Purplechickens. Maximizing technological innovations and the Internet to sing about overseas Filipino workers, the 360-degree music video &ldquo;#GoogleMissKoNa&rdquo; enables the viewer to &ldquo;rotate&rdquo; the camera using arrow buttons on the video interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music on television also served as venues for the proliferation and distribution of &ldquo;novelty songs.&rdquo; Rapper Abra offers a scathing critique, when his chorus scoffs at popular mass media &ldquo;not to make a fool out of me&rdquo; while the video shows him drawing the million-peso prize from a hat, accompanied by upbeat rhythms, similar to those of novelty songs. Sung in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5121\"><strong>Bisaya</strong></a>, the music video &ldquo;Ako si M16&rdquo; (I am M16) by Cebu-based reggae band Junior Kilat, aired on national TV initially via UNTV, tells of the arms trade and overspending on guns and violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Employing chiaroscuro effects to the band members and framing a narrative based on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5634\"><strong>Edgardo M.

Besides cinematic shots and local literary roots of the story being told, the words of the chorus &ldquo;rage against the dying of the light&rdquo; reference Dylan Thomas&rsquo;s classic villanelle poem &ldquo;Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night,&rdquo; but the quoted phrase in the lyrics followed by &ldquo;sing a song against this terrible sight&rdquo; modifies the originally personal message of Thomas&rsquo;s poem to the political and social. The song remains relevant until now not just because of its aesthetic influences but also because it contains and critiques social realities. Inspired by rap-metal band Rage Against the Machine, Dicta License&rsquo;s &ldquo;Alay sa mga Nagkamalay noong Dekada Nobenta&rdquo; (An Offering to Those Who Were Enlightened in the 1990s) stresses the call and need to change the grave ills besetting Philippine society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Paying tribute to the martyrs of Hacienda Luisita, the <b><i>HLMX Trilogy</i></b>, produced by Luisita Watch and Molotov Pilipinas, tells about the decades-long agrarian reform struggle in the country, as concretely manifested in Hacienda Luisita. Calling to action, the chorus of 5 Year Plan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pagbawi&rdquo; (To Take Back) calls on the listeners to take the land back; Goons N&rsquo; Guns&rsquo;s &ldquo;Luisita&rsquo;s Cry&rdquo; wails &ldquo;blood, sweat and tears, Lusita&rsquo;s been crying for years&rdquo; with Tagalog verses rapped to contain the chants, ending with the slogan: &ldquo;<i>tunay na reporma sa lupa ipaglaban</i>&rdquo; (fight for genuine agrarian reform). In Gazera&rsquo;s<b> </b>&ldquo;Kung Puntod na ang mga Bukirin&rdquo;<b><i> </i></b>(When Farms Have Turned into Graves), based on Axel Pinpin&rsquo;s poem of the same title, the ghosts of the victims come alive, expressed in the articulation that &ldquo;the land is breathing, demanding for justice,&rdquo; haunting the despotic landlords who perpetrated their killing. Combining the three videos together is a little girl traversing the sugarcane field, interspersed with real documentary footage of the struggle for land, concluding with raised red flags in the <i>azucarera </i>(sugar refinery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With these variety of themes discussed in music videos on television, Philippine social realities have been and are still being recorded, not just as an appendage of the business ventures of the entertainment industry but also as avenues for the expression of aspirations for a better future and as warning shots of unrest that may be transformed into offensives of collective resistance. <em><strong>Written by Arbeen Tilde Acu&ntilde;a</strong> </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"src\">\r\n<p>AbraTV 2013; Caruncho 1996; Caven Studios 2014; Dalmacion 2009; Dicta License 2015; Dubeye74 2010; Edralin 2006; Gil 2001; <i>GMA News Online</i> 2007; Google Philippines 2015; Ianumali 2008; Liongoren 2007; Luisita Watch 2015; Mabuhay 2011; Maniemjr 2006; MCA Music Inc 2009; Moller 2011; Pastor 2015; Peake 2015; <b><i>Philstar.com</i></b> 2014b; Pinoyhiphop, n.d.; PinoyTV.pitas.com, n.d.; Puertollano 2008; Rivera 2007; Schizo Archives 2014; Schizo102 2007; Stompworks Studios 2006; The Jerks 2015; UniversalRecPH 2011; Valenzuela 2005; WolfgangPhilippines 2008; <i>World Heritage Encyclopedia</i>, n.d.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n",

The performance of compositions is through singing, dancing, or instrument playing. <b><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/21/1069\"><strong>Musical</strong></a>s</b> are shows with music as the main element that drives the narrative and dramatic plot forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music programs can be <b>variety</b> or <b>magazine shows</b> combined with talk and special features. While often an incongruous mixture of styles and elements characterize most music programs, some have a common theme that weaves the segmented pieces together. The thematic focus can be on an artist, composer, choreographer, genre, period, or trend. Early music programs in the Philippines had live acts with the attendance of studio audiences. The format began to include singing contests. In the 1970s, some singers lip-synched the song performances, but this practice has declined through the years, owing to the requirement of audiences for good, honest performance. Lately, music videos and reality talent shows have become a trend, setting new formats of a music program.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Music programs have been mainstays in Philippine broadcast media since it began. Henry Herman&rsquo;s experimental broadcasts in 1922 featured music and news. Isaac Beck, whose <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a> station began to air in 1925, broadcast Filipino artists and <i>sarsuwela </i>singers in <i>bodabil</i> and radio shows. In a society rooted soundly in strong oral traditions, it is no wonder these shows, which cover variety show musicals, live performances and concert series, singing contests, and personality platter shows, easily captured and continue to arrest the attention of many Filipinos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Many early Philippine music programs were patterned after American formats like the vaudeville, with its mix of cheerful music and comical skits to entertain audiences. It was during this era that Philippine radio popularized such characters as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pugo</strong></a> and Togo, German San Jose and Leonora Reyes, Andoy Balun-balunan and Dely Atay-atayan, and Vicente Ocampo and Diana Toy. In the mid-1930s, the rise of blocktimers and blocktime shows augmented the bodabil-type of variety show to feature multiple sponsors and multiple ensembles of performers and radio artists. The format stayed and evolved in Philippine radio until its golden years, the decades from post-World War II until the martial law era, which saw the resurgence of music radio shows after years of taking a backseat to news, commentary, and Japanese anti-American propaganda during World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The post-World War II years saw a more distinctly Filipino approach to radio programming and content production in spite of still markedly American influences. With the coming of television, the emergence of the Philippine recording industry, the development of the stereo and, by consequence, the popularization of FM radio transmissions, Philippine media companies began to tap more local artists for recording and distribution of music, resulting in a resurgence of music programs. Through the golden years of Philippine radio, Filipino singers rose to fame, with the 1950s yielding Bimbo Danao, Phil Delfino, Belle Gonzales, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3905\"><strong>Don David</strong></a></strong>; the 1960s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3943\"><strong>Pilita Corrales</strong></a>, Sylvia La Torre, RJ Jacinto, and several teenage bands; and the 1970s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4277\"><strong>Nora Aunor</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4211\"><strong>Basil Valdez</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4357\"><strong>Sharon Cuneta</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3863\"><strong>Hajji Alejandro</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4041\"><strong>Celeste Legaspi</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3937\"><strong>Jose Mari Chan</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/3933\"><strong>Ryan Cayabyab</strong></a>, and other artists who formed the so-called Pinoy Rock and Manila Sound anteceding the Original Pilipino Music (OPM) brand in later years. Throughout these periods, the Filipinized bodabil<i> </i>gained much traction, giving birth to derivative formats of the variety show genre in music programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> launched<b> <i>Jam Session</i></b>, 1961, a youth-oriented music program starring Bobby Ng and a band called the Hi-Jacks; <b><i>The Lucky Strike Show</i></b>, 1963,<i> </i>hosted by Nelda Lopez Navarro; and evening variety shows like <b><i>Oras ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/926\"><strong>Ligaya</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Happy Hour) and a discotheque program called <b><i>Nineteeners</i></b>, both in 1966.

It drew its appeal from a soundly Filipino-anchored selection of music, with revivals of old folks songs, lullabies, kundiman, <i>harana </i>(serenade), and <i>balitaw </i>(courtship song); and costumed singers in traditional garb singing in rural and historical settings.

In 1950, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1513\"><strong>Tawag ng Tanghalan</strong></a></i></b><i> </i>(Call of the Stage) started airing on DZBB, featuring aspiring singers who competed with each other for a career as professional singers. Contestants were either eliminated by the interruption of a gong or a bell or allowed to finish their renditions. Some of its notable winners were <strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4931\"><strong>Pepe Pimentel</strong></a></strong></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4079\"><strong>Diomedes Maturan</strong></a>, Cenon Lagman, Eva Adona, Ofelia Dayrit, Novo Bono Jr, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4071\"><strong>Ric Manrique</strong></a> Jr, Edgar Mortiz, and Jonathan Potenciano. The show was adapted to television in 1965 and aired on Channel 3, hosted by one of its previous winners Pepe Pimentel. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of its most notable champions was Nora Aunor in 1967, whose victory through a rendition of &ldquo;Moonlight Becomes You&rdquo; won her roles on broadcast variety shows and bolstered her eventually long-standing career in film, radio, and television. <b><i>Hamon sa Kampeon </i></b>(Challenge to the Champion), hosted by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4891\"><strong>Dely Magpayo</strong></a> and Pepe Pimentel, also became immensely popular when it was launched in 1965. In 1984, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4220\"><strong>Regine Velasquez</strong></a> was catapulted into public attention when she became the grand champion of <b><i>Ang Bagong Kampeon</i></b><i> </i>(The New Champion) singing &ldquo;In Your Eyes.&rdquo;<b><i> </i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Singing competitions remained popular on television for decades to follow. Local versions of foreign and international competitions were later launched on national television, with <b><i>Star for a Night</i></b>, 2002-03, IBC 13, based on the United Kingdom&rsquo;s program of the same title, and the reality singing competition <b><i>The Voice Philippines</i></b>, 2013-15,<b> </b>ABS-CBN,<b> </b>adapted from the format of <b><i>The Voice of Holland</i></b>, with four judges gauging undiscovered talents in search of the best singers in the country.

An announcer, later called a disc jockey or DJ, hosted a show and played a selection of records while engaging listeners between songs. This type of programming was designed to bolster record sales. Indulging song requests sent by mail and dedicating particular songs to particular listeners added to the novelty of the format. Among the most popular were <b><i>Cashmere Bouquet Top Tunes</i></b> hosted by Larry Ng, <b><i>Latina Americana</i></b> hosted by Louie Garcia, and <b><i>Roll of Honor</i></b> hosted by Eddie Mercado. Shows that catered specifically to audience requests and dedications included <b><i>Request Jamboree</i></b> hosted by Dick Taylor, <b><i>Night Owl</i></b> hosted by Lito Gorospe, <b><i>All Night Stand</i></b> hosted by Jo San Diego, <b><i>Mailbag Jukebox</i></b> hosted by Angelo and Cherrie Castro, and <b><i>Platter <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/222\"><strong>Bungalow</strong></a></i></b> hosted by Bong Lapira.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Specialized programming also came to popularity due to the rise of television. Radio programs were reinvented to cater to niche markets and specific audiences. <b><i>Voice of Firestone</i></b>,<b><i> </i></b>hosted by Ray <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1253\"><strong>Oliver</strong></a>, featured Broadway melodies, and <b><i>Silahis ng Pag-asa</i></b> (Ray of Hope), hosted by Ric Tierro, featured light classical music. Stations also became identified with certain markets. Among the commercial stations that sprouted after World War II was DZRJ in 1963, a station managed by music enthusiast <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4020\"><strong>Ramon Jacinto</strong></a> specializing in playing rock and roll music and, later, popular music and dance. Mareco Broadcasting Network Inc, owned by the Manila Record <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, advocated locally produced music. DZFX of the Makati Broadcasting Network first went on the FM airwaves in 1968 with a broadcast of mood music, film soundtracks, and period pieces. Popular among teenagers were DZXX, which set the trend by specializing in popular music. Workers and housewives were drawn to the radio dramas in DZAQ, DZRH, and DZXL. Local popular music by local singers were featured in DWOW. On the FM band, old-fashioned and instrumental music were played on DZFX.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">To date, <b>niche programming</b>, or <b>format radio</b>, has dictated modern radio programming especially on FM-band stations. From the 1990s onward, stations began to produce shows that were programmed according to the perceived station brand. In 1991, Mareco Broadcasting Network Inc tailored Power 105 to play only &ldquo;easy listening&rdquo; and &ldquo;world-class music,&rdquo; which later shifted to 105.1 &ldquo;crossover&rdquo; sounds. Makati Broadcasting Company pulled out of the platter show race by converting 101.1 Kiss <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/779\"><strong>Jazz</strong></a> into DWST Showbiz Tsismis. In 1992, GMA Network relaunched The Giant 97.1 DWLS as the youth-oriented Campus Radio 97.1 LS FM. In 1995, DWAD 97.9 became DWQZ 97dot9 Home Radio with the change of station hands from the Crusaders Broadcasting Company to <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1101\"><strong>Aliw</strong></a> Broadcasting Company. DWRX 93.1 was rebranded as Monster Radio RX 93, &ldquo;Metro Manila&rsquo;s First Creative Radio Station&rdquo;; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4775\"><strong>Bombo Radyo Philippines</strong></a> transformed 102.7 Gentle Wind into Star FM 102.7; and Radio Partners Inc repackaged DWCD 103.5 as 103.5 K-Lite. In 1996, Far East Broadcasting Company&rsquo;s DZFE 98.7 specialized in classical and Christian music with the slogan &ldquo;Christ for the World by Radio.&rdquo; In 1998, UR 105 identified itself as Underground Radio. Various other music-driven radio stations became widely popular. NU 107 was the go-to station for modern rock radio. CityLite 88.3, which had focused on adult contemporary music, later became Jam 88.3, with a more modern and alternative music selection. Mellow Touch, which previously had a predominantly easy listening format, was repackaged into Mellow 94.7, moving into mellow pop-alternative and light rock. RJ 100, previously The Hive 100.3, which used to play alternative music and classical rock, was rebranded to an all-oldies format. Wave 98.1 became the go-to station for easy listening rhythm and blues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as many stations have shifted or extended to online radio formats with the advent of the digital age, music programs remain staple programming in traditional media. With the range of forms and types developed across history, the choices for mediated musical experiences have also expanded such that, in whatever medium, for whatever purpose, in whatever time, catering to whomever&rsquo;s taste, there is always something for everyone&rsquo;s listening needs.<em><strong><span style=\"text-justify:inter-ideograph\">Written by Louise Jashil R.

The format began to include singing contests. In the 1970s, some singers lip-synched the song performances, but this practice has declined through the years, owing to the requirement of audiences for good, honest performance. Lately, music videos and reality talent shows have become a trend, setting new formats of a music program."

Stations also became identified with certain markets.

Mareco Broadcasting Network Inc, owned by the Manila Record <a href=\"/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, advocated locally produced music. DZFX of the Makati Broadcasting Network first went on the FM airwaves in 1968 with a broadcast of mood music, film soundtracks, and period pieces. Popular among teenagers were DZXX, which set the trend by specializing in popular music. Workers and housewives were drawn to the radio dramas in DZAQ, DZRH, and DZXL. Local popular music by local singers were featured in DWOW. On the FM band, old-fashioned and instrumental music were played on DZFX."

In 1992, GMA Network relaunched The Giant 97.1 DWLS as the youth-oriented Campus Radio 97.1 LS FM.

In 1996, Far East Broadcasting Company&#x2019;s DZFE 98.7 specialized in classical and Christian music with the slogan &#x201C;Christ for the World by Radio.&#x201D; In 1998, UR 105 identified itself as Underground Radio. Various other music-driven radio stations became widely popular. NU 107 was the go-to station for modern rock radio. CityLite 88.3, which had focused on adult contemporary music, later became Jam 88.3, with a more modern and alternative music selection. Mellow Touch, which previously had a predominantly easy listening format, was repackaged into Mellow 94.7, moving into mellow pop-alternative and light rock. RJ 100, previously The Hive 100.3, which used to play alternative music and classical rock, was rebranded to an all-oldies format. Wave 98.1 became the go-to station for easy listening rhythm and blues."

A story is either broadcast live or prerecorded from the field by a reporter. For radio, the anchor reads the entire story, or introduces the story that is followed by a field reporter&rsquo;s narration of the event, which is either prerecorded or covered live from the field. For television, the anchor provides the lead of the story, followed by a reporter&rsquo;s coverage of the news. The reporter&rsquo;s presentation often includes a voice-over narration, video and audio clips, animated or digital images and graphics, and brief sound bites of interviews. Lately, sound effects or music accompanies the presentation of the news, and some news programs have short editorials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The history of Philippine broadcast news can be traced along two lines: the political and the economic. The Philippine press, including broadcast, is often cited the freest in Asia. Broadcast stations at various stages in the country&rsquo;s history have suffered repression from the state, and in turn have checked the abuses of the state through reports that have had significant impact on nation-building. Yet, in the economic sense, broadcast news in the country faces significant restrictions, which stem from the nature of their ownership: broadcast networks are owned by entrepreneurs who have business interests elsewhere and who consider news a commodity, subject to the contest for ratings and profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Newscasts in the 1920s were <b><i>El Conde de Guell</i></b> and <b><i>Sunkist News</i></b>, both on KZRM, which were sponsored by brands of cigars and a juice drink, and <b><i>Palmolive Newsreel of the Air</i></b>, DZIB, sponsored by a brand of bath soap. The best announcers of the period were Americans; Filipinos broke into newscasting only in 1934. Among the first announcers were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4801\"><strong>Ira Davis</strong></a>, Vero Perfecto, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4944\"><strong>Norman Reyes</strong></a>, Leon Ma. Guerrero III, and Koko Trinidad, who was the first Filipino to be given an English newscasting assignment on KZRM. Newscasts in Spanish were read by local Spaniards, among them Conchita Garriz. Newscasts in the Visayas were trilingual. On KZRC in Cebu, Jose del Mar and Gaudencio Pe&ntilde;a read the news in Spanish while Jose Bautista announced the news in Cebuano, and American Harry Fenton read the news in English (Alburo 1997; <b><i>History of Philippine Radio Stations</i></b> 1979). Radio stations started producing radio commentaries. While many Filipino announcers spoke like American newscasters, Tagalog was slowly gaining its entry into broadcast. By 1940, most of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a>&rsquo;s programs were in Tagalog, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>KZRF</strong></a> had <b><i>News in Tagalog </i></b>(<b><i>Broadcast Media Development Program</i></b>, n.d.; Jimenez 1996; Lent 1973; Trinidad 2000; Reuter 2001). Some news were dramatized, particularly the weekly news summaries of the early 1940s, with Trinidad and Lamberto Avellana impersonating the voices of important political personalities from around the world. Regular news programs, however, were brief and comprised only five percent of programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">With war looming on the horizon, news programs on all radio stations increased in length and frequency. News programs were closely monitored by the American colonial administration to check the loyalty of the Filipinos. The government put up <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4871\"><strong>KZND</strong></a> for its own newscasts and announcements. On 5 Jan 1942, the station <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4989\"><strong>Voice of Freedom</strong></a>, so named by Gen Douglas MacArthur, went on the air with the program of the same name, <b><i>Voice of Freedom</i></b>, which broadcast nightly at 6:00, on varying frequencies to elude interference. Romulo, Guerrero, and <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5464\"><strong>Salvador P. Lopez</strong></a></strong> wrote the news and commentary in English which Romulo, Guerrero, and Norman Reyes took turns reading on the air (Reyes 1995). The English newscast and commentary were followed by the program <b><i>Tinig ng <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4027\"><strong>Kala</strong></a>yaan</i></b>&mdash;Tagalog for voice of freedom&mdash;voiced by Philippine Army Lieutenant Francisco Isidoro, who translated the English scripts to Tagalog and delivered them on the air. These news broadcasts did not last because Japanese forces advanced toward Manila. The surrender of Corregidor silenced the <b><i>Voice of Freedom</i></b>. In early May 1942, the <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4990\"><strong>Voice of Juan de la Cruz</strong></a></i></b> went on the air. It was the voice of 18-year-old Carlos Malonzo, broadcasting comments about events happening in Manila. The program lasted for two months. The Japanese cornered and executed him, but his wife, Violet Brown, carried on the broadcast for another two months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Broadcast news during the Japanese occupation was mainly overt propaganda through endless lectures and political speeches. The Japanese-captured KZRH, later renamed PIAM, broadcast announcements from the Japanese Military Administration. Newscasts in English, Tagalog, and Spanish of 15 minutes each were aired three times a day. Eventually, the news was also regularly read in Nihongo. Broadcasters of the Japanese-controlled radio station were Filipinos, among whom were, ironically, KZND station manager Vero Perfecto and Voice of Freedom news writer, commentator, and announcer Leon Ma. Guerrero III. KGEI was a critical source of news from the United States, with Filipinos on its staff translating and reading the news in English to Tagalog, Ibanag, Ilocano, Pangasinan, Pampango, Bikol, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5383\"><strong>Hiligaynon</strong></a>, Cebuano, and Moro. Indeed, radio news immediately before World War II and during the Japanese occupation was a tug of war between American forces and Japanese troops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Post-World War II broadcast news was a mix of politics and economics. The amount of airtime dedicated to news programs increased. There was more coverage of live news events and commentary. These developments were partly helped by advances in broadcast technology, but were also provoked by opposing political forces that increasingly used broadcasting for political gain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Most remembered commentators of the 1960s were <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4991\"><strong>Rafael Yabut</strong></a>, in his early morning program <b><i>Gumising sa Pagsikat ng Araw </i></b>(Wake Up at the Break of Dawn), DZRH, and Damian Sotto, in <b><i>Mangatwiran Ka</i></b> (Reason Out), DZAQ; both were critics of organized religion and government corruption. <b><i>Radyo Patrol</i></b> (Patrol Radio) of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>&rsquo;s DZAQ would become the model for news reporting on radio and would produce the likes of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4904\"><strong>Orly Mercado</strong></a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4950\"><strong>Barr Samson</strong></a>, Rey Langit, Emmy Arcilla, Joe Taruc, and Bobby Guanzon. Robert Stewart editorialized the late evening news<b><i> </i></b>in <b><i>The News with Uncle Bob</i></b> on RBS-TV. The leading news television program of its time was <b><i>The Big News</i></b>, beginning in 1962, ABC Channel 5, with Duds Rivera and Bong Lapira, who would be replaced by Jose Mari Velez. In 1970, KBS-TV launched <b><i>Newswatch</i></b>, with Harry Gasser as main anchor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">When Marcos placed the country under martial rule in 1972, the media was among the first to be silenced, literally in the case of radio and television. The first of the regular evening television news programs to go on the air was the government-produced <b><i>The DPI Reports</i></b>. News programs included <b><i>NewsWatch</i></b>, KBS-RPN;<sup> </sup><b><i>News at Seven</i></b>, RBS-GMA; <b><i>Newsday</i></b>, IBC 13; <b><i>Newscenter 4</i></b> and <b><i>News Today</i></b>, both on GTV 4; and <b><i>BBC Balita </i></b>(BBC News), Channel 2, the first primetime news program in Filipino after martial law was declared. Broadcast news programs during martial law were monitored and censored. The networks kept silent about the many inconvenient truths about the Marcos dictatorship. All news about the activities of the political opposition was absolutely forbidden on the air. An interesting development, however, was the entry of women into broadcast news.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The character of broadcast news radically changed in the aftermath of the assassination of Sen Benigno Aquino Jr on 21 Aug 1983. Events chanced upon each other in rapid succession that led to the EDSA Revolt in Feb 1986 which unceremoniously ousted the government of Marcos. The revolt was kindled by <b><i>Radyo Bandido </i></b>(Bandit Radio), the clandestine program of <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>June Keithley</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> who called on the people, via Radio Veritas and DZRJ, supported by the voice of Jaime Cardinal Sin on the airwaves, to rally behind a group of the military that turned its back on Marcos. The news on radio and television, both from the government and the mutineers, tugged on the hearts and minds of the Filipinos. Contending political forces competed in controlling the airwaves, with the people participating in the reality of the visuals and the sounds of the fury of the times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News became the most valued program after the 1986 EDSA Revolt. The restoration of freedom and democracy emboldened AM radio stations to strengthen their news programming. Filipino became the language of television news, spearheaded in 1987 by <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, ABS-CBN. News programming was highly marked by what critics would call the tabloidization of news that skewed the content, format, and style of reporting toward entertainment and sensationalism, all in the rush to capture a wider audience reach and increase ratings and profits. Interestingly, however, broadcast companies started sending their journalists to do war and disaster coverage all over the globe. A remarkable development was the live coverage of impeachment trials of the country&rsquo;s leaders and legislative hearings on the scandalous corruption perpetrated by government officials. News programs also began engaging a transnational audience, addressing the news information needs of overseas Filipinos, and bringing the news to a wider international audience.<em><strong>Written by Elizabeth L.

All news about the activities of the political opposition was absolutely forbidden on the air. An interesting development, however, was the entry of women into broadcast news."

Events chanced upon each other in rapid succession that led to the EDSA Revolt in Feb 1986 which unceremoniously ousted the government of Marcos. The revolt was kindled by <b><i>Radyo Bandido </i></b>(Bandit Radio), the clandestine program of <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"/8/69/4874\"><strong>June Keithley</strong></a></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong> who called on the people, via Radio Veritas and DZRJ, supported by the voice of Jaime Cardinal Sin on the airwaves, to rally behind a group of the military that turned its back on Marcos. The news on radio and television, both from the government and the mutineers, tugged on the hearts and minds of the Filipinos. Contending political forces competed in controlling the airwaves, with the people participating in the reality of the visuals and the sounds of the fury of the times."

				"value": "News became the most valued program after the 1986 EDSA Revolt. The restoration of freedom and democracy emboldened AM radio stations to strengthen their news programming. Filipino became the language of television news, spearheaded in 1987 by <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>, ABS-CBN. News programming was highly marked by what critics would call the tabloidization of news that skewed the content, format, and style of reporting toward entertainment and sensationalism, all in the rush to capture a wider audience reach and increase ratings and profits. Interestingly, however, broadcast companies started sending their journalists to do war and disaster coverage all over the globe. A remarkable development was the live coverage of impeachment trials of the country&#x2019;s leaders and legislative hearings on the scandalous corruption perpetrated by government officials. News programs also began engaging a transnational audience, addressing the news information needs of overseas Filipinos, and bringing the news to a wider international audience.<em><strong>Written by Elizabeth L.

It featured five women candidates called &ldquo;reyna&rdquo; (queens), who are each interviewed to share their individual experiences. The one who earns the loudest applause is adjudged the &ldquo;reyna&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5044\"><strong>Ani</strong></a>ceto 1945).</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">During the early days of reality programming&rsquo;s inception on Philippine television, its presence consisted primarily in the deployment and integration of its conventions in different television genres, resulting in hybrid shows. Several television shows during the 1990s included segments that contain elements of reality programming. The country&rsquo;s longest-running gag show <b><i>Wow Mali</i></b><i> </i>(Oh No, It&rsquo;s a Mistake), 1996-2006, 2009-15, ABC/TV5, conceptualized by host-comedian Joey de Leon, involves a roving crew playing and documenting practical jokes on real people on the streets, with the humor aspect generated by the spontaneous reactions and responses of the prank victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">At the beginning of the new millennium, some television shows resorted to assimilating the conventions of reality-based programming to gain ground in the ratings war. For instance, the lifestyle show <b><i>Extra, Extra</i></b> was reformatted to <b><i>Extra Challenge</i></b>, 1999-2006, GMA Network, a reality-based show inspired by American reality-based challenge competitions that featured celebrities pitted against one another in a weeklong series of challenges ranging from extreme sports to immersion in the lives of ordinary citizens. <b><i>Click</i></b>, 1997, GMA,<i> </i>a youth-oriented afternoon television series, briefly ran a promotional reality game show, in which the teen cast competed against one another in a series of island challenges. Television talk shows and noontime variety shows also included occasional reality-based challenge segments that involved celebrity guests participating in studio games, or accomplishing a series of challenges in different outdoor locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 2000s has been marked by the massive importation and localization of various foreign reality television franchises that range from reality-based challenge series to talent searches. Among these television imports are <b><i>Pinoy Big Brother</i></b><i> </i>(Filipino Big Brother), which premiered in 2002 on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>, arguably the most sensational among the reality-based franchises, which features participants living together in a house subjected to perpetual surveillance for the duration of the show while accomplishing different challenges contrived by the unseen game master &ldquo;Kuya&rdquo; (Big Brother); the reality game show cum social experiment, and the talent-search <b><i>Pinoy Dream Academy</i></b>, 1996, ABS-CBN, which combines the format of <b><i>Big Brother</i></b><i> </i>and reality-based singing competitions by confining the contestants in a monitored house, as they battle against one another in a series of singing challenges; <b><i>Philippine Idol</i></b>, 2006, ABC 5, a reality-based singing competition patterned after the successful <b><i>American</i> <i>Idol</i></b><i> </i>franchise, which follows the journey of hopefuls from the audition phase to their live performances; and <b><i>Survivor Philippines</i></b>, 2008-12, GMA, a competitive survival challenge that gathers celebrities in an isolated tropical island bereft of any luxuries of modern living. These reality television shows have also served as springboards for the careers of celebrity hopefuls, as eventually the winners and even finalists pursue successful show business careers after signing contracts with the respective networks that released these franchises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Visibly influenced by the global successes of international reality television franchises, as well as by the palpable enthusiasm of local audiences for the genre, local television networks have created original reality television shows. Locally created &ldquo;<i>artista</i> searches&rdquo; (talent searches) <b><i>Starstruck</i></b>, 2003, GMA, and <b><i>Star Circle</i> <i>Quest</i></b>, 2004, ABS-CBN, follow the journey of youth participants aspiring to enter show business in a series of auditions and workshops. Another reality show, <b><i>30 Days</i></b>,<i> </i>launched in 2004, GMA, features former television and film actors and actresses aspiring to revive their careers as they are pitted against one another in a series of challenges intended to determine who among them is the worthiest to gain a second chance in the show business. <b><i>Born Diva</i></b>, 2004, ABS-CBN, integrates the conventions of a singing competition with an actual documentation of the cosmetic transformation of female contestants. In what can be construed as an effort to invite the sympathy of viewers, local reality-based talent searches noticeably integrate documentary modes to foreground the dramatic life stories of the participants (Sanico and Papa 2006). Another observable element in these local reality-based competitions is that, similar to their foreign counterparts, they forward the impression of a high level of interactive participation from the viewers, as television audiences decide who leaves, stays in, and eventually wins the competition by casting votes through telecommunication channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Various local reality-based challenge shows were also produced in recent years. The paranormal reality show <b><i>Philippine Scariest Challenge</i></b>, 2008, TV5, highlighted celebrity contestants accomplishing a set of challenges in a haunted location. Sports-related challenges are showcased in programs like <b><i>Pinoy Mano Mano: Celebrity Boxing Challenge </i></b>(Filipino Hand to Hand: Celebrity Boxing Challenge), 2007, ABS-CBN, and the long-running lifestyle-reality show <b><i>Sports Unlimited</i></b>, 1997-2015, ABS-CBN. Integrating reality-based challenges with the conventions of a wish-granting show, <b><i>Day Off</i></b>, 2005, QTV-11, features celebrities taking on the occupational duties of selected individuals, who are then luxuriously treated to a single-day vacation leave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">News and public affairs programs have also been formatted to appropriate the conventions of reality television. Investigative shows like <b><i>Isumbong Mo Kay Tulfo</i></b><i> </i>(Report It to Tulfo), 1993-2006, RPN 9, make use of hidden cameras, a questionable practice, to catch offenders in the act of committing crimes during entrapment operations, as well as to document the arrest procedures of law enforcement authorities. GMA Network&rsquo;s <b><i>Imbestigador</i></b><i> </i>(Investigator), an investigative show that began in 2000 and hosted by Mike Enriquez, documented (through the use of hidden cameras) illegal activities both in private and public offices, and the entrapment operations conducted by authorities. In 2010, GMA Network launched <b><i>Rescue</i></b>, hosted by Arnold Clavio, a reality-documentary program that featured actual footage of rescue operations conducted by authorities and civilians in response to accidents, calamities, and crimes. Another public affairs program is <b><i>Face to Face</i></b>, 2014, TV5, dubbed the &ldquo;Barangay Hall On-Air,&rdquo; which invites disputing individuals on studio to settle their personal arguments with the help of the show&rsquo;s resident counselors. Elements of reality television can likewise be gleaned in the inclusion of closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage, as well as in the presence of civilian newscasters in news programs, as in the case of the CCTV Patrol and Citizen Patrol segments in ABS-CBN&rsquo;s <b><i>TV Patrol</i></b>. These elements somehow heighten the impression of increased public participation in the accomplishment of the mass media industry&rsquo;s mandate as purveyors of socially relevant information and avenue for the articulation of mass grievances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reality television series have also been developed to document the lives of local celebrities, particularly highlighting aspects of their lives previously unexposed to the public eye. <b><i>Melason</i></b>, 2010, ABS-CBN, dubbed as the first spin-off to <b><i>Pinoy Big Brother</i></b><i> </i>(PBB), documented the lives of real-life couple and former PBB<i> </i>contestants Melai Cantiveros and Jason Francisco, as they face the pressures that go with their newfound fame and the challenges it brings to their relationship. <b><i>It Takes Gutz to Be a Gutierrez</i></b>, 2014, TV5, focuses on the lives of the members of one of the biggest celebrity families in the local show business, following them in their domestic and career engagements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Reality television brings forth difficult questions concerning the blurring of the line between public and private spheres. In addition to this, even the genre&rsquo;s claim to reality remains an open sphere for interrogation, since the mediating dynamics that go into the processes of television production bring into the picture how a specific reality television program uneasily navigates the tension between authenticity and artificiality. Programs that bear elements of reality programming have also received accusations of exploitation and sensationalism. For instance, <b><i>Pinoy Big Brother</i></b><i> </i>has faced controversies and was censured by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board, the government regulatory board, for airing intimate scenes that &ldquo;violate public norms of taste and decency.&rdquo; Nevertheless the consistently vigorous response of television viewers to this mode of programming, along with the widened accessibility to technologies that allow users to document and upload virtual captures of actual events in real time, implies that reality television&mdash;or at least, its conventions&mdash;will remain an enduring presence in the local media landscape. <em><strong>Written by Laurence Marvin S.

		"text": "<p class=\"SectionItemhead\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\"><b>Talk shows</b>, also known as <b>talk entertainment programs</b> or <b>chat shows</b>, are radio and television programs in which a host or several hosts discuss various topics, usually with celebrity guests or with experts on the subject of the day. Audiences are typically enjoined to participate, whether through call-ins or, in more recent formats, through online engagements in the show&rsquo;s website or Facebook page. Many notable talk shows draw their entertainment value from the boldness, unconventionality, or humor of the host, and from the popular or controversial nature of the topics they engage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Talk entertainment was not a major genre during the early days of broadcasting in the Philippines. The genre would see its full potential on television only during the few years before the declaration of martial law in 1972. Talk focused on selling the shows of movie stars and recording artists, slowly segueing to interview formats that took special interest in their lives as showbiz personalities and, beginning in the mid-1980s, in the lives of ordinary people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A pioneer of the genre was <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b>, a talk-public affairs program, first aired on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>, then DZXL-TV 9 from 1967 to 1972, on GMA from 1979 to 1986, and then again on ABS-CBN from 1986 to 1987. Hosted by Elvira Manahan and Joey Lardizabal (later Nestor Torre Jr), it was known for bold and edgy discussions that were particularly controversial because the program first aired before the dark ages of martial law. Johnny Litton began in 1969 as a segment host of <b><i>Two for the Road</i></b>, then went on to host the 13-year run of <b><i>Oh No, It&rsquo;s Johnny</i></b>, 1987-99,<i> </i>ABS-CBN, with society columnist Maurice Arcache, and, a few years later, <b><i>Oh Yes, Johnny&rsquo;s Back</i></b>, also on ABS-CBN, with Anton San Diego and Tessa Prieto-Valdes<i>. </i>Known for his congenial wit, he conducted his shows with a propriety appealing to the show&rsquo;s more elite target audiences, veering away from the brusque, often abrasive, styles typical of show business talk shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Jose &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; Quirino, also known as JQ, hosted a television show on IBC 13 called <b><i>Seeing Stars with Joe Quirino</i></b>, 1975-86. The show featured his interviews with movie celebrities and television stars and had a song-and-dance segment for added entertainment. With the same formal, dignified approach, but more interesting and engaging, and with more wit and humor, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4531\"><strong>Edu Manzano</strong></a> hosted <b><i>Not So Late Night with Edu</i></b>, 1985, GMA, and <b><i>Late Night with Edu</i></b>, 1992-94, and <b><i>What&rsquo;s Up Doods?</i></b>, 2013, both on ABC/TV5<i>. </i>In <b><i>MAD:</i></b> <b><i>Martin After Dark</i></b>, 1988-93, GMA, retitled <b><i>Martin Late at Night</i></b>, 1993-98, ABS-CBN, singer and wacky host <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4101\"><strong>Martin Nievera</strong></a> interviewed showbiz personalities, often teasing them and forcing his guests to reveal something about their personal lives, before ending the show with a song number dedicated to his guest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&ldquo;Queen of Intrigues&rdquo; Inday Badiday, whose real name was Lourdes Jimenez-Carvajal, handled talk entertainment with candid bluntness and evident familiarity with the ins and outs of show business that allowed her to dish out juicy scoops and exclusive interviews with celebrities and fledgling personalities alike, through the many programs she hosted in her long career. Known to many as &ldquo;Ate Luds,&rdquo; she hosted shows that set the template for later talk show programs, such as <b><i>Nothing but the Truth</i></b>, 1976, and <b><i>Would You Believe?</i></b>, 1978, both on BBC 2, then <b><i>See-True</i></b>, 1979-87, IBC 13 then on GMA, followed by <b><i>Movie Patrol</i></b>, 1986, <b><i>Eye to Eye</i></b>, 1988, and <b><i>The Truth and Nothing but the Truth</i></b>, 2000, all on GMA<i>. </i>These programs centered on showbiz gossips and scandals, with a panel of movie reporters who queried guests, mostly vulnerable young actors, aging starlets, soft-core porn actors, superstars, and showbiz personalities eyeing public office, who often lied in their answers. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4910\"><strong>Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB)</strong></a> admonished the show several times for what the board called trash and trivia on television. The Philippine Association of National Advertisers (PANA), badgered by concerned audiences offended by these programs, had in some instances called the attention of these programs for the guests&rsquo; and co-anchors&rsquo; foul language and rude behavior on television, and PANA members, bowing to public pressure, once withdrew their sponsorship of these shows.

In the 2000s, Magic 89.9 had <b><i>Good Times with Mo Twister</i></b><i> </i>and <b><i>Boys&rsquo; Night Out</i></b>.

Mass-based radio talk entertainment, many of them hosted by two gay guys for an added fun factor, became characterized by comical and energetic banter between hosts, steady streams of jokes and witticisms, and droll exchanges with awkward yet excited guest callers, all punctuated by canned laughter and other, often cartoonish, sound effects.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"text-align:justify; margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Talk entertainment has served mainly to amuse and regale Filipino audiences, although historically they have flirted with pertinent issues and serious journalism. While many talk show programs have been criticized for exploiting controversies and for turning private issues into public spectacles, their appeal continues to stem from the voyeuristic draw of digging into lives of glitz and glamour and humanizing perceived stars and idols. Furthermore, the ruthless candor and unsanitized banter provide a welcome relief from the rigors of more formal media genres and open up spaces for more flexible public discourse as it invites audiences to participate in discussions however spontaneously. As such, talk entertainment remains an important platform for shaping opinion and dictating the loci of public attention. Greater vigilance is thus needed in contending with its continuing production and consumption. <em><strong>Written by Louise Jashil R. Sonido</strong> </em><em><strong>with notes from Eulalio R.

The term teleradyo is a stylized portmanteau, meaning television and radio. Its origin comes from the word simulcast, which refers to simultaneous broadcasting, a term coined in 1948 by a press agent at WCAU-TV, Philadelphia, USA (Crosby 1948). Based on the definition of this term, the simultaneous airing of programs over radio and television is not a new concept in many countries, including the Philippines. Important presidential public addresses, milestone coverages such as Congress hearings, huge rallies, and the launching of celebrities, commercial products, or network programs have been recurring depending on the importance or significance of these events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Thus, the idea of a teleradyo, as closely identified with the Philippines&rsquo; largest broadcast network, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a>&rsquo;s DZMM TeleRadyo, is not new. What makes ABS-CBN a &ldquo;pioneer&rdquo; in teleradyo is that it is the first radio network that simultaneously aired its entire programs, not just a portion of the day&rsquo;s programming, on cable television 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Thus, DZMM, found on 630 khz on the AM band, is also available on Skycable Channel 26 in Metro Manila, and on TVplus, the network&rsquo;s digital TV box, as well as in other cable stations nationwide, every day.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">DZMM TeleRadyo, as initiated by ABS-CBN, was formally heard and seen on 12 Apr 2007. The audience simultaneously hears the radio station DZMM and sees a live-feed of the radio booth and the program hosts on television. However, no advertising content is fed into the TeleRadyo; instead, video materials promoting the station&rsquo;s programs are aired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aside from seeing the broadcasters inside the radio booth on television, the latest news, other information relevant to the day&rsquo;s current issues, and advertisements are flashed on an assigned corner of the television monitor or the computer screen. Text messaging and the use of any electronically mediated platform by the viewers and listeners are utilized for a more interactive broadcasting and livestreaming experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The other radio station that airs simultaneously on radio and cable TV is DZRH, the flagship AM radio station of Manila Broadcasting <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/131\"><strong>Company</strong></a>, which has the biggest number of radio stations, almost 500, in the country. DZRH is on the 666 frequency on the radio set and can be seen on Cablelink Channel 3 in Metro Manila, as well as in other cable stations nationwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"photo_holder_2\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">It is interesting to note that DZRH claims that it is the first on-air screen channel seen on Skycable and, later, on Dream SatelliteTV and other cable TV channels nationwide with 300 cable affiliates. It was first known as TV Natin, which was launched in Dec 2008. It was then rebranded as DZRH RadioVision, and much later changed to DZRH Television (RHTV). Finally, in Oct 2013, it was renamed as DZRH News Television.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Aksyon TV of TV5 Network Inc is a hybrid news channel that broadcast its radio programs on 92.3 News FM simultaneously on UHF free TV Channel 41 in Metro Manila and Channel 1 on CIGNAL Digital TV.

				"value": "<b><a href=\"/8/64/1370\"><strong>Teleradyo</strong></a></b> is the simultaneous transmission of a radio and/or television signal over two or more networks or stations, or two or more platforms, such as combining or blending AM, FM, television, cable, and, with the new digital technology, <b>online streaming</b> or <b>webcasting</b>. The term teleradyo is a stylized portmanteau, meaning television and radio. Its origin comes from the word simulcast, which refers to simultaneous broadcasting, a term coined in 1948 by a press agent at WCAU-TV, Philadelphia, USA (Crosby 1948). Based on the definition of this term, the simultaneous airing of programs over radio and television is not a new concept in many countries, including the Philippines. Important presidential public addresses, milestone coverages such as Congress hearings, huge rallies, and the launching of celebrities, commercial products, or network programs have been recurring depending on the importance or significance of these events."

What makes ABS-CBN a &#x201C;pioneer&#x201D; in teleradyo is that it is the first radio network that simultaneously aired its entire programs, not just a portion of the day&#x2019;s programming, on cable television 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Thus, DZMM, found on 630 khz on the AM band, is also available on Skycable Channel 26 in Metro Manila, and on TVplus, the network&#x2019;s digital TV box, as well as in other cable stations nationwide, every day."

		"text": "<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\"><b>Television specials</b> are produced to cover or celebrate significant national or international events of high audience interest that happen rarely or only once annually, such as papal visits, beauty pageants, awards nights like the Oscars, the Olympics, and high-prize boxing matches.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey are typically longer than the one-hour weekly show, lasting anywhere between a few hours of one-time programming, such as a Christmas musical special, to several days of intermittent coverage such as that of elections. Traditionally, specials had high production value and were elaborately planned entertainment shows. Of late, the subject matter of specials has included controversial news events and issues, as in special documentaries and reportage. Not part of regular programming, specials are a product of attempts to attract the largest percentage of viewers at a specific time. In the United States, the costly extravaganza called television spectacular in the 1950s gave way to the scaled-down television special toward the end of the 1960s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Considered the first television special in the Philippines was the live coverage by ABS DZAQ TV of the world junior lightweight boxing championship match between Filipino boxer Gabriel &ldquo;The Flash&rdquo; Elorde and Harold Gomes of the United States on 16 Mar 1960. With 36,000 watching inside the newly built <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/263\"><strong>Araneta Coliseum</strong></a> in Cubao, Quezon City, Elorde won the 12-round fight, and his victory made him a boxing legend in Philippine sports. Another first was the inauguration of President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Fernando Lopez in Dec 1965, which was promoted as a television special. Since then, all presidential and vice presidential inaugurations were covered by the television media. Also for the first time, a national election was covered live by radio and television. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4749\"><strong>ABS-CBN</strong></a> Channel 3 conducted a 36-hour coverage of the 1967 national elections for eight Senate seats and local government positions in<b><i> Halalan &rsquo;67 </i></b>(Elections &rsquo;67). It covered the balloting and the first day of the canvass, benchmarking succeeding election coverages. In 1971, the <b><i>Bilang ng Bayan</i></b><i> </i>(Count of the Nation), which covered the canvass of votes in polls for president, vice president, eight senatorial seats, congressional seats, and local government positions, was considered a special coverage that raised the bar for special election coverages first set by <b><i>Halalan &rsquo;67</i></b>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"carousel_holder_1\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">In the 1960s, only a few specials were broadcast on Philippine television, mostly emanating from the United States, the most memorable of which were the historic twin broadcasts of the Apollo 11 lunar space launch at Cape Kennedy, Florida, on 16 Jul 1969 and the lunar landing four days later on 20 Jul 1969. Then president Marcos declared the day of the launch, a Wednesday, a special national holiday to allow the people to watch the live coverage of the liftoff. All the television channels in the Philippines carried the satellite transmission simultaneously, with Robert Stewart of RBS-TV Channel 7 as the main anchor of the Philippine segment. The following Sunday, Apollo 11 landed on the moon and the live broadcast was again carried by all Philippine TV channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The 1970s saw several television specials, many of which were international boxing matches between prizefighters. The most memorable is the 1 Oct 1975 match between heavyweights Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier at the Araneta Coliseum dubbed <b><i>Thrilla in Manila</i></b>, covered live by RPN Channel 9. With Filipino professional boxing referee <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4581\"><strong>Carlos Padilla</strong></a> Jr as the third man in the ring, the prizefight put the Philippines on the boxing map of the world. Before the <b><i>Thrilla in Manila</i></b>, ABC Channel 5 brought to Filipino audiences the 5 Apr 1970 fight between Japanese Yoshiaki Numata and Filipino Rene Barrientos for the World Boxing Council super featherweight title at the Metropolitan Gym in Tokyo, Japan. Barrientos lost the fight, which was aired as a television special, although not broadcast live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Three decades later, boxing matches again became the subject of television special productions. The first several international title bouts of Filipino boxing champion Emmanuel &ldquo;Manny&rdquo; Pacquiao were aired as television specials, including those held abroad, mostly in the United States. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the best remembered is his bout with Oscar Larios of Mexico for the World Boxing Champion Super Featherweight title on 2 Jul 2006 at the Araneta Coliseum. It was broadcast live to Philippine audiences as Pacquiao won the 12-round match. Later Pacquiao matches, however, were watched by viewers through specialized cable channels and, by the second decade of the 21st century, over pay-per-view facilities. This meant that boxing matches no longer met the definition of the traditional television special, but became a new type of program format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Television specials featuring beauty pageants, particularly the Miss Universe, Miss International, and Miss World pageants and their local counterparts, have generally enjoyed good audience ratings from past to present. In 1974, RPN Channel 9 covered the first Miss Universe pageant hosted by the Philippines. Held at the Folk Arts Theater in Manila, Amparo Mu&ntilde;oz of Spain won the title. Twenty years later, in 1994, the Philippines hosted the pageant anew, this time at the Philippine International Convention Center in Pasay City. The crown went to Sushmita Sen of India. Since the 1970s, international beauty contests were aired via satellite through local TV stations. In the 2010s, the consecutive victories of Filipino contestants in many international beauty competitions made the latter a lucrative TV production venture. Audiences were glued to the live or recorded telecast to witness how Philippine candidates successfully competed. In the Miss Universe pageant, Venus Raj was fourth runner-up in 2010; Shamcey Supsup and Ariella Arida were third runners-up in 2011 and in 2013, respectively; Janine Tugonon was first runner-up in 2012; and Pia Wurtzbach won the crown in 2015. In 2013, Megan Young won the Miss World contest, Bea Rose Santiago got the Miss International crown, and Mutya Datul won the title of Miss Supranational (<b><i>Rappler</i></b> 2013).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Celebrity marriage proposals and weddings are made into specials owing to the <i>kilig </i>(thrill) factor as well as the glamour of these events. The wedding of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4459\"><strong>Richard Gomez</strong></a> and Lucy Torres was produced into a special by ABS-CBN in 1998. Zoren Legaspi&rsquo;s surprise marriage proposal to Carmina Villaroel was aired on ABS-CBN in 2012. Blurring the lines between fact and fiction was the special feature on the wedding reception of Maya and Richard &ldquo;Sir Chief&rdquo; Lim, played by actors Jodi Sta. Maria and Richard Yap, who were the romantic couple in the serial drama <b><i>Be Careful with My Heart</i></b>, 2012-14, ABS-CBN. The much-awaited wedding of Dingdong Dantes and Marian Rivera in 2014 was aired over GMA Network in early 2015. In the same year, GMA released a special coverage on the island wedding of politician Chiz Escudero and Heart Evangelista.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Papal visits to the Philippines, which have happened only four times in a span of 45 years, are also the subject of television specials. The first pope to visit was Paul VI in Nov 1970, but the news was transmitted only through the regular newscasts. When John Paul II came in Feb 1981 and Jan 1995, the coverage was extensive, and regularly scheduled programs had to give way. The same happened when Francis came in Jan 2015. Predominantly Catholic, audiences in record numbers watched the live television specials and the replays of the several events Francis attended while in the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Among the television specials that air once a year are the various media awards, such as the American Oscars for cinema, Emmy Awards for television, Grammy Awards for the recording industry, and Tony Awards for stage arts and sciences. Local award-giving bodies that produce coverage of awarding ceremonies are the Filipino Academy of Movie Arts and Sciences, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4530\"><strong>Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino</strong></a>, the Film Academy of the Phlippines, the Philippine Movie Press Club, and the Metro Manila Film Festival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Apart from the traditional Christmas specials, there are yearly specials during designated times of the year. <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Peek-a-Boo!) departs from its daily variety show and produces a dramatic series with a moral or religious theme during Holy Week. News and public affairs departments of broadcast networks produce yearender retrospectives to highlight the big issues and to summarize the newsmakers of the departing year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Some TV specials are produced to influence public opinion on national and international issues. <b><i>Dear Sam &hellip; Sumasaiyo, Juan</i></b> (Dear Sam &hellip; Yours, Juan), 1989, was an anti-US bases documentary that exposed the negative social, cultural, and political effects of the presence of the US military bases in the Philippines. It was censored by the <em><span style=\"font-style:normal\">Movie and Television Review and Classification Board </span></em>under the Cory Aquino administration. Its suppression escalated into a heated public issue and became the subject of a Senate hearing. The TV special was finally aired in 1990 over ABS-CBN. The anti-US bases special won Best TV Special of the Year in the 1990 Gawad CCP para sa Telebisyon. Then in 1991, the Philippine Senate voted to end the presence of American military bases in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Never-to-be-repeated occurrence, such as the turn of the new millennium in 2000, was a big media event. All TV and radio networks aired how peoples and nations all over the world celebrated the coming of the year 2000. News events also end up as television specials, both as special coverage of breaking news and as subjects of documentary specials. These include the declaration of martial law in 1972, the EDSA Revolt of 1986, the coup d&rsquo;etat attempts against the administration of Corazon Aquino in 1987 and 1989, the impeachment of President <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/26/4424\"><strong>Joseph Estrada</strong></a> in 2000-1 that led to EDSA 2 in 2001, and the trial of Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona in Jan 2012. In 2013, the Lahad Datu standoff in Sabah revived the issue of the Sultanate of Sulu&rsquo;s historic claim over Sabah. This was followed by the confrontation between the Moro National Liberation Front and the Philippine military in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1318\"><strong>Zamboanga</strong></a> City in the same year (Medina 2013). Government functions, such as state visits, have all been the subject of special television specials. Every year, there are special live coverages and features on the annual State of the Nation Address of the incumbent president of the Republic of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Natural disasters and calamities have been the subject of TV special reports since the time of the 1968 earthquake that reduced Manila Chinatown&rsquo;s Ruby Tower into rubble, killing hundreds of people. Other major calamities that were the topic of special reportage on radio and TV were the 1990 earthquake, the 1991 Mount Pinatubo explosion, and the 2009 deluge caused by Typhoon Ondoy. As climate change ushers in extreme weather disturbances, the phenomenon became a tragic reality in 2013 with the advent of super typhoon Yolanda, which came right after the earthquake that damaged many parts of the Visayas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Developments in broadcast cable television, the impact of digital technologies, and the consequent rise in pay-per-view television service have reduced the value of the television special as a programming strategy. By the second decade of the 21st century, the only specials left on television apart from the news and documentary specials are the traditional international beauty pageants and annual awards ceremonies. The lucrative pay-per-view boxing specials are no longer aired live; they are still aired on television but only by way of delayed telecast or replay. Although the television special is still around, the competition presented by specialized cable television channels and the on-line media has taken away some of the splendor originally associated first with the television spectacular, and later with the television special. <em><strong>Written by Victor C.

The most memorable is the 1 Oct 1975 match between heavyweights Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier at the Araneta Coliseum dubbed <b><i>Thrilla in Manila</i></b>, covered live by RPN Channel 9. With Filipino professional boxing referee <a href=\"/4/26/4581\"><strong>Carlos Padilla</strong></a> Jr as the third man in the ring, the prizefight put the Philippines on the boxing map of the world. Before the <b><i>Thrilla in Manila</i></b>, ABC Channel 5 brought to Filipino audiences the 5 Apr 1970 fight between Japanese Yoshiaki Numata and Filipino Rene Barrientos for the World Boxing Council super featherweight title at the Metropolitan Gym in Tokyo, Japan. Barrientos lost the fight, which was aired as a television special, although not broadcast live."

The first several international title bouts of Filipino boxing champion Emmanuel &#x201C;Manny&#x201D; Pacquiao were aired as television specials, including those held abroad, mostly in the United States. <a href=\"/5/40/964\"><strong>One</strong></a> of the best remembered is his bout with Oscar Larios of Mexico for the World Boxing Champion Super Featherweight title on 2 Jul 2006 at the Araneta Coliseum. It was broadcast live to Philippine audiences as Pacquiao won the 12-round match. Later Pacquiao matches, however, were watched by viewers through specialized cable channels and, by the second decade of the 21st century, over pay-per-view facilities. This meant that boxing matches no longer met the definition of the traditional television special, but became a new type of program format."

In 1974, RPN Channel 9 covered the first Miss Universe pageant hosted by the Philippines. Held at the Folk Arts Theater in Manila, Amparo Mu&#xF1;oz of Spain won the title. Twenty years later, in 1994, the Philippines hosted the pageant anew, this time at the Philippine International Convention Center in Pasay City. The crown went to Sushmita Sen of India. Since the 1970s, international beauty contests were aired via satellite through local TV stations. In the 2010s, the consecutive victories of Filipino contestants in many international beauty competitions made the latter a lucrative TV production venture. Audiences were glued to the live or recorded telecast to witness how Philippine candidates successfully competed. In the Miss Universe pageant, Venus Raj was fourth runner-up in 2010; Shamcey Supsup and Ariella Arida were third runners-up in 2011 and in 2013, respectively; Janine Tugonon was first runner-up in 2012; and Pia Wurtzbach won the crown in 2015.

Both the show and the performers were sponsored by blocktimers, which were commercial products that bought blocks of airtime. These sponsors included a wet market, a shopping center, and brands of automobiles, delivery truck, battery, cooking lard, alcoholic drink, toothpaste, milk, cigar, juice drink, oatmeal, and bath soap. These shows had live performances and had fans inside the radio studio to provide live laughter and applause. Examples include <b><i>Chevrolet Jamboree</i></b> on KZRM, <b><i>Purico Troubadors</i></b>, <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1421\"><strong>Camay Theater of the Air</strong></a></i></b>, and <b><i>Glossy Merrymakers</i></b> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4869\"><strong>KZIB</strong></a>, and <b><i>The San Miguel Brewery Hour</i></b> on <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4874\"><strong>KZRF</strong></a>.

The next year, <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> became a noontime television program on DZXL-TV Channel 9. The show consistently topped the ratings in noontime programming until 1964, and during its return to Philippine television in 1975, GMA. It had its final run in 1990 on RPN 9.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The show that beat <b><i>Student Canteen</i></b> was <b><i><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/67/1435\"><strong>Eat Bulaga!</strong></a></i></b> (Peek-a-Boo!), which premiered in 1979 and continues to dominate the noontime slot. It is hosted by the comic trio of Tito Sotto, Vic Sotto, and Joey de Leon. It first aired on RPN 9, then on ABS-CBN, and has been airing since 1994 on GMA. <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> follows the conventional segments of a variety show, but periodically introduces new concepts that have helped maintain its popularity to audiences nationwide. Examples are &ldquo;Bulagaan&rdquo; (Joke Time), &ldquo;Little Miss Philippines,&rdquo; &ldquo;Laban o Bawi&rdquo; (Wager or Take Back), &ldquo;Pinoy Henyo&rdquo; (Genius Filipino), &ldquo;Juan for All, All for Juan,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kalyeserye&rdquo; (Street <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>Drama</strong></a></strong> Serial) that created the monster hit &ldquo;Al-Dub&rdquo; phenomenon, a tongue-in-cheek comic sketch that mixes the scripted and the unscripted, as well as reality, hilarity, and virtuality. The show has been franchised by a leading television network in Indonesia, to which it exports all its contests and segments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">The public has hurled numerous criticisms at the program, mainly for the &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; mode of comedy of its main hosts, and the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board has either admonished or suspended members of the cast for various instances of below-the-belt and sexist innuendos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">Formidable competitors of <b><i>Eat Bulaga!</i></b> were variety shows produced by ABS-CBN, which included <b><i>&rsquo;Sang Linggo nAPO Sila </i></b>(The APO Now Runs for a Week), 1995-98, <b><i>Magandang Tanghali</i></b>,<b><i> Bayan</i></b> (Good Noon, Nation), 1998-2005, <b><i>Wowowee</i></b>, 2005-10, and <b><i>It&rsquo;s Showtime</i></b>, which began in 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\" style=\"margin:0in 0in 0.0001pt; text-align:justify\">A very popular host of the talk variety program was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/8/69/4979\"><strong>Ariel Ureta</strong></a>, who captured the hearts of the Filipino audience via the noontime show called <b><i>12 O&rsquo;Clock High</i></b> on BBC 2. From <b><i>Noontime Matinee</i></b> and <b><i>For the Boys</i></b> on IBC 13, Ureta moved back to BBC 2 with <b><i>Ariel con Tina </i></b>(Ariel with Tina), and the early-evening variety show <b><i>Ariel &amp; Co.
