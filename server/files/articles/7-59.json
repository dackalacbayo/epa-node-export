Quezon City: University of the Philippines (UP) Library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book contains a foreword by Marina Dayrit, UP librarian; a preface by editor Edna Zapanta-Manlapaz; Manlapaz&rsquo;s introduction on <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>&rsquo;s life and writings; eight selected works; and a bibliography of Tolentino&rsquo;s 33 extant pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anthology highlights Tolentino&rsquo;s most important and representative works. His best-known piece, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow), 1903, labeled the most seditious of his plays, caused his arrest during its staging at the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">Teatro</a> Libertad in Manila. Other works in the collection are <strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong>, 1913, a narrative in verse allegorizing the nation&rsquo;s struggle against, but eventual submission to, the new colonizer; <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/510\"><strong>Bagong Cristo</strong></a></em></strong> (New Christ), 1907, a three-act prose <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> depicting the plight of the Filipino laboring class; and <strong><em>La&nbsp;</em><em>Rosa</em></strong> (The Rose), 1908, a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> about two men trying to deceive another man into selling his tobacco factory, La Rosa. It also includes <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2357\">Pampango</a> pieces such as <strong><em>Damayan</em></strong> (Mutual Aid), 1911, a one-act sarsuwela; <strong><em>Ing Poeta</em></strong> (The Poet), undated, a one-act drama; and <strong><em>&iexcl;Hilat! &iexcl;Aray!</em></strong> (Ouch!), 1908, a one-act sarsuwela; as well as a Spanish one-act lyric drama, <strong><em>Boda Maldita</em></strong> (Damn Wedding), 1908.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The selections were culled from the manuscripts, typescripts, holographs, and other materials donated by Tolentino&rsquo;s daughters Corazon Tolentino and Raquel Tolentino-Victoria to the UP Library in 1973. The anthology&rsquo;s purpose is to provide the text of Tolentino&rsquo;s works to theater and literature students and researchers. However, space limitations allowed the publication of only eight works. All the texts are printed in their entirety except for <strong><em>Bagong Cristo</em></strong> and <strong><em>Ing Poeta</em></strong>, which have several missing pages. Manlapaz assures readers, however, that the works remain sufficiently intact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the introduction, Manlapaz presents a tally of the playwright&rsquo;s total works, numbering 67 and distributed as follows: 33 <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> works, 21 Pampango, and 13 Spanish, as derived from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5493\">E. Arsenio Manuel</a>&rsquo;s appendix to his own biography of the dramatist.

Though the <strong>mambabalagtas</strong> (poet performers) displayed proficiency in spontaneous versification&mdash;as exemplified by Jose Corazon de Jesus and Florentino Collantes, rivals for the title &ldquo;Hari ng Balagtasan&rdquo; (King of Balagtasan)&mdash;they wrote scripts that worked as outlines of their performance. The more a script was staged, the easier it became for the mambabalagtas to improvise arguments and punch lines in rhyme and meter, to the amusement of the audience. Another example is the false impression that the balagtasan was confined to the Tagalog-speaking region. Due to the form&rsquo;s massive appeal to the public, poets in other Philippine languages, particularly Pampango, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a>, as well as Spanish and English, devised their own poetic jousts similar to the balagtasan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zafra narrates that the form also became popular in print and broadcast media. The first balagtasan script by Patricio A. Dionisio came out in <strong><em>Bagong Lipang Kalabaw</em></strong> on 5 Apr 1924 and served as the prototype for the three pairs of poets who joined the first balagtasan contest held at the Instituto de Mujeres on 6 Apr 1924. Balagtasan scripts published in magazines were well received, proven by a lively voting system of readers asked to choose among competing poets who argued on a national issue, by sending in coupons found on the page their preferred script appeared. For instance, in the &ldquo;<em>balagtasan sa pahina</em>&rdquo; (balagtasan on page) about <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow) that came out in the weekly magazine <strong><em>Sampagita</em></strong> from Aug to Dec 1926, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2764\">Julian Cruz Balmaseda</a>, who stood for &ldquo;Bukas,&rdquo; received 14,337 votes; Ramos, who sided with &ldquo;Ngayon,&rdquo; received 8,168 votes; and Regalado, who defended &ldquo;Kahapon,&rdquo; received 7,612 votes. Following the same pattern, when the balagtasan was brought to the radio, listeners cast their votes via phone calls or mail sent through the postal service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 19 scripts collected in the book cover the wide range of topics or themes discussed in the balagtasan. The author categorized three prevalent general themes in the period covered by his study:&nbsp;<em>pampolitika at panlipunan&nbsp;</em>(political and social),&nbsp;<em>pag-ibig at iba pang birtud&nbsp;</em>(love and other virtues), and&nbsp;<em>pangkaraniwang bagay&nbsp;</em>(conventional matters). All three, however, revolve around the central ideas of deliverance from colonial rule, espousing Filipino heroism, recovering the glorious past, and asserting native identity and culture. These scripts prove that the balagtasan is a literary form that affirms the keen relationship between art and life. Specifically, it manifests how art can be of service to people by treating its audience not as mere spectators but as jurors who have the power to decide the winning argument. Finally, since the balagtasan uses the common language of the people, it is a critical exercise that enlightens about the deceptions of political domination and is a means to ward off such an imperialist act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book won the Gawad Chanselor for Best Published Research, University of the Philippines Diliman, in 2002, and the Gintong Aklat Award for literature from the Book Development Association of the Philippines in 2000. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5187\"><strong>Michael M.

Quezon City: Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research and Development, University of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Published in celebration of the centennial of the 1896 Revolution, this book is an anthology of 35 political plays written from 1967 to 1996, culled from the different Philippine regions, within three years of research. The plays were chosen to represent the different periods of revolutionary struggle in Philippine history&mdash;namely, the First Quarter Storm, 1967-72; the Marcos Dictatorship and Martial Law, 1972-86; the Aquino Regime&ndash;Low Intensity Conflict and Total War Policy, 1986-92; the Ramos Regime and the Philippines 2000, 1992-96; and the Underground Movement, 1968-96. Plays from the underground movement were difficult to date and document in terms of their time of writing and production, so they are given a section separate from the chronological listing of plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plays are described as&nbsp;<em>mapanghimagsik&nbsp;</em>(revolutionary) as they embody the people&rsquo;s revolutionary struggle against all forms of oppression and exploitation. Set in context of different periods and regions, they highlight the strength of mass and revolutionary movements and the correctness of the armed revolution. Themes center on the plight of workers, peasants, and the ordinary Filipino, and how these people act against their abject conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anthology journeys through the development of revolutionary plays from one period to another, explaining changes in the plays brought about by historical and sociopolitical contexts and the processes that theater collectives underwent to write scripts and stage them. Through summaries and annotations, the anthology covers revisions and the enactment of multiple versions that clarify the genealogy of some plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plays range from the serious, comedic, realistic, expressionistic, to the musical in form. Some adopt traditional Filipino theater forms such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> (passion play) or <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><strong>dupluhan</strong></a> (poetic joust). The influence of Chinese stances, such as in the tableaux, thrust positions, and waving of red flags, is also evident in some plays. Minimalist and experimental pieces also have a place on the progressive and revolutionary stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the plays included in the anthology are unpublished, available only as encoded, typewritten, or handwritten manuscripts. Some plays from the underground movement are not inscribed for security reasons. Some of the more familiar pieces are from theater groups like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3338\">University of the Philippines Repertory Company</a>, and from published books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common characteristic of the plays is the flexibility of production, based on the need to adapt to security situations, considering the political themes of the works and the nature of the organizations staging them. Most productions survived on the principle of the &ldquo;aesthetics of poverty&rdquo; to manage the meager resources of theater groups. Some of the plays were staged in traditional venues such as university theaters, but many were performed in nontraditional venues&mdash;streets, picket lines, school corridors, open areas of communities, and even far-flung villages, as in the case of the plays of the New People&rsquo;s Army. Some plays engaged the audience to interact with the actors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anthology not only documents <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\">drama</a> as a response of the people to the oppression of the different regimes but also brings to the surface the many stories of people whose everyday lives are a stage for political and economic struggles. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

A very helpful feature is the diagrammatic flow of the theater module under study.

Respeto</a>. Department of Filipino and Philippine Literature, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This study follows the &ldquo;construction&rdquo; of the town of Pakil through its literary texts, performances, and religious practices. Observing the well-known <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">ritual</a>s for the Virgin of Turumba, the author asserts that a town&rsquo;s identity is built on narratives culled from its literature and performances. His concept of &ldquo;<em>bayang panitikan</em>&rdquo; (town as literature/literature as town) regards the&nbsp;<em>panitikang namamayani&nbsp;</em>(dominant literature) as open literary texts that embody a critical &ldquo;<em>kamalayan</em>&rdquo; (consciousness). These become the town&rsquo;s literature through ritualization and the people&rsquo;s practice of the <strong>pag-ako</strong> (taking on), reflecting its geography and economy, translated and constantly validated through the performance of the religious rituals. These give rise to a constant redefinition of the&nbsp;<em>bayan&nbsp;</em>not only in terms of territoriality, politics, or class but also in terms of the town&rsquo;s consciousness and identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1 tackles the complex interweaving of local rituals as historical and spiritual narratives that translate to new narratives as they are performed. Drawing from previous studies by anthropologists and performance theorists, the author asserts that local literature represents the town&rsquo;s ethos, and its expressions are evolved by the people, further validated as ritualized and performed. The author&rsquo;s research methodology comprises&nbsp;<em>pakikipamuhay&nbsp;</em>(living in the community),&nbsp;<em>pakikipanayam&nbsp;</em>(interview), attendance of the holy rituals,&nbsp;<em>dokumentasyon&nbsp;</em>(note-taking and photo documentation),&nbsp;<em>paggalugad sa mga lugar&nbsp;</em>(searching the locale), and doing research in local libraries and university libraries in the Philippines and abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 explores the relevant demographic information of Pakil, Laguna&mdash;such as its geography, land use, population distribution among its 12 barangays, infrastructure and urban development, major calamities, uprisings and social upheavals, political and socioeconomic profile, local artistic expressions such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> and <strong>prusisyon ng Turumba</strong> (procession of Turumba), and places of interest&mdash;providing a backdrop for discussion on the religious narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 3, Respeto argues that the narratives, stored in the people&rsquo;s memory, are the foundation of spirituality in Pakil, popularized by word of mouth since Spanish colonization, and rationalize Pakil&rsquo;s origins, the power of nature, the miracles of saints, and the potency of the sacramental. Dances and dramatic scripts draw inspiration from the miraculous episodes attributed to the Virgin and to Jesus Christ. The spaces where these supposed miracles occur become spaces for the performance of rituals related to the Virgin of Turumba.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4 describes the rituals associated with the Virgin of Turumba as performance and as a continuing process of meaning formation&mdash;putting up the main procession, its conduct, and narratives interwoven into song, dance, costumes, and visual design; the reenactment of finding the miraculous image of the Virgin of Sorrows in the shoreline of Laguna Lake; the <strong>pag-ahon&nbsp;</strong><strong>sa Ping-as</strong> (climbing in Ping-as), which pertains to the reenactment of the <strong>Daan ng Krus</strong> (Way of the Cross) on the path leading to the top of the Ping-as mountain; and the <strong>Pagsusuob sa Senyor</strong> (burning incense under the body of the dead Christ). The author posits that the&nbsp;<em>kamalayang pandula&nbsp;</em>(theater consciousness) can be gleaned from these various dramatic elements and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5 discusses common local areas, such as the church, plazas, streets, mountains, and lakeshore, as spaces for the performance of the rituals. Such spaces are also transformed into little stores for local products such as the&nbsp;<em>pamaypay&nbsp;</em>(fans),&nbsp;<em>taka&nbsp;</em>(papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;), and food products. The rituals create opportunities for social collaboration in support of the town&rsquo;s livelihood and unique beliefs, deeply ingrained as they are in the people&rsquo;s consciousness. Specific schedules and spaces are allotted for the integration of people from the neighboring towns of Laguna; the yearlong calendar lists a number of activities devoted to the Virgin, a celebration that sets the people of Pakil apart from other towns. The ritual, as performed, is a holistic expression of the bayan, its evolving concept of territory and people&rsquo;s participation determined by their level of engagement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 6, a synthesis, illustrates the various religious processions in the town&rsquo;s local topography. The author argues that these religious rituals, their narratives and performances, provide the materials for the production of literary texts, which encapsulate the town&rsquo;s religiosity. These rituals are lived activities that through time have transformed everyday spaces into performative areas and have provided opportunities for community collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, through the practice of the pag-ako, the rituals are performed repeatedly and thus bring to life expressions of faith, gratitude, and sacrifice for the Virgin of the Turumba. The pag-ako has led to the creation of texts and the performance of the ritual as part of the continuing creation and redefinition of Pakil&rsquo;s identity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Included in the dissertation are pictures of the Turumba, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/453\">Flores</a>, Panghulo Swimming Pool, Reenactment, Senyor, and Pag-ahon sa Ping-as, as well as narratives on the history of Pakil and the Turumba, religious songs and prayers, and documents and laws from Pakil. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2755\">Glecy C.

University of Wales, Aberystwyth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 422-page manuscript is a study of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/448\"><strong>dotoc</strong></a> (pilgrimage), the religious devotion of the Bikolnons to the Holy Cross. It focuses on the dotoc as currently practiced in three Camarines Sur towns (namely, Baao, Nabua, and Canaman) and one Albay town (namely, Tinago, Bigaa). The dotoc, an exclusively Catholic devotion enacting the journey of pilgrims to the Holy Land to visit the Holy Cross, or Santa Elena&rsquo;s search for and eventual location of the cross, is undeniably a colonial and thus a non-Filipino/Bikolnon text. Llana examines the dotoc as a problem of representation, weaving through questions of subjectivity and agency as contextualized specifically in coloniality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study is marked by a &ldquo;grappling,&rdquo; to use Llana&rsquo;s word, with questions that beset an academic not just from a former colony but a former member of the underground movement whose politics and ethics explicitly ground the research. With Baao as her own hometown, Llana interrogates the double position (subject/object) she occupies in her research, as well as the propriety of ethnography itself as a discipline and methodology.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Llana finds that the researcher is &ldquo;caught between two opposing positions&rdquo;&mdash;an endless multiplicity or fluidity against absolute totality. Dialoguing with various postcolonial scholars, Llana eventually discovers, or more precisely rediscovers, the Bikolnon word&nbsp;<em>anduyog&nbsp;</em>(co-performance) as a possible methodological route. Anduyog allows the researcher to simultaneously take the position of subject/object as it gathers in a word the six principles that guided the research: presence, paying attention, participation, visibility, reflexivity, and activism. Llana, a Filipino, a Bikolnon from Baao, and a theater person, actually sang and participated in the dotoc, thereby taking the position of object as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study begins with the question of form, tracing the different positions taken by earlier scholars, and eventually taking the dotoc as theater. This allows Llana to underline the performance of the devotees. The notion of performance brings Llana to the question of the &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; of the dotoc. By looking at dotoc as performance, Llana is able to demonstrate the iterability of the dotoc; in each performance of the dotoc by the community, it is not the Roman Catholic alone who speaks but the Bikolnon as well. Llana asserts that rather than the story itself, the Bikolnon are drawn to the act of storytelling.

				"value": "The 422-page manuscript is a study of the <a href=\"/7/55/448\"><strong>dotoc</strong></a> (pilgrimage), the religious devotion of the Bikolnons to the Holy Cross. It focuses on the dotoc as currently practiced in three Camarines Sur towns (namely, Baao, Nabua, and Canaman) and one Albay town (namely, Tinago, Bigaa). The dotoc, an exclusively Catholic devotion enacting the journey of pilgrims to the Holy Land to visit the Holy Cross, or Santa Elena&#x2019;s search for and eventual location of the cross, is undeniably a colonial and thus a non-Filipino/Bikolnon text. Llana examines the dotoc as a problem of representation, weaving through questions of subjectivity and agency as contextualized specifically in coloniality."

With Baao as her own hometown, Llana interrogates the double position (subject/object) she occupies in her research, as well as the propriety of ethnography itself as a discipline and methodology."

Dialoguing with various postcolonial scholars, Llana eventually discovers, or more precisely rediscovers, the Bikolnon word&#xA0;<em>anduyog&#xA0;</em>(co-performance) as a possible methodological route. Anduyog allows the researcher to simultaneously take the position of subject/object as it gathers in a word the six principles that guided the research: presence, paying attention, participation, visibility, reflexivity, and activism. Llana, a Filipino, a Bikolnon from Baao, and a theater person, actually sang and participated in the dotoc, thereby taking the position of object as well."

				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "The study begins with the question of form, tracing the different positions taken by earlier scholars, and eventually taking the dotoc as theater. This allows Llana to underline the performance of the devotees. The notion of performance brings Llana to the question of the &#x201C;meaning&#x201D; of the dotoc. By looking at dotoc as performance, Llana is able to demonstrate the iterability of the dotoc; in each performance of the dotoc by the community, it is not the Roman Catholic alone who speaks but the Bikolnon as well. Llana asserts that rather than the story itself, the Bikolnon are drawn to the act of storytelling. Each telling of the story, therefore, is simultaneously a retelling of the Catholic story and a telling of the community&#x2019;s current aspirations. As a symbolic act of a community, performed annually by the community as a community, Llana nevertheless finds the dotoc as multiple in its very singularity. The multiplicity is such that Llana asserts she can only present the dotoc in its very multiplicity, studying the different texts and their structures as used in the four towns.

		"text": "<p>Published 1976. Author, Felicidad M. Mendoza. Makati City: Society of St. Paul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book summarizes Mendoza&rsquo;s years of involvement in the production and popularization of the <strong>comedia</strong>. Published for students, teachers, and professors-researchers of drama and theater, both local and foreign, the book is one of the first references on comedia as an indigenous art form. The book has an introduction by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/42/4030\">Lucrecia R. Kasilag</a>, a foreword by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5653\">Alejandro R. Roces</a>, and four parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 1 offers a background of the comedia. Chapter 1 of part 1 is a historical overview of the comedia as an art form, the Philippine comedia, and comedia as a national art form. Mendoza starts from the Western concept of comedy as a dramatic form that arouses laughter. She compares this with the <strong>batalla</strong>, a display of martial art or movement, which projects a comic rather than tragic tone. This chapter further investigates the origin of the <strong>moro-moro</strong>, ending with the popularization phase of the comedia, which has since gained a following in the provinces despite the influences of the <strong>zarzuela</strong>, movies, and television. Mentioned are comedia performances in Para&ntilde;aque, Quezon, Laguna, La Union, Pangasinan, Pampanga, Naga City, Ilocos, Bicol region, and Cebu, as well as the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3029\">Kudyapi Community Theater</a> (later called Kudyapi, Philippines), founded by Mendoza herself. Mendoza concludes that the popularization of the comedia affords it a place as a national art.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 details the dramatic and stage elements of the Philippine comedia. Used as a medium for religious propaganda, the comedia&mdash;as a verse drama, a dance drama, a religious play, a stylized drama, and melodrama&mdash;follows a similar plot. Mendoza describes the process of designing the stage, costumes, music, and sound, as well as the skills and movement for handling weapons for battle scenes. She compares stage movement patterns among the comedia performances in Marinduque, Ilocos, and Laguna. She also elaborates on arnis or&nbsp;<em>kali&nbsp;</em>as an art or technique of defense, which is incorporated into the comedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapters 3 and 4, artistic and sociocultural processes in the Philippine comedia are presented. Mendoza frames the comedia as a folk enterprise because of the participation of community members. In chapter 5, the comedia is compared to its European versions: the <strong>morisca</strong> (dance showing Moors in battle), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/458\"><strong>moros y cristianos</strong></a> of Spain, <strong>juegos de moros y christianos</strong> (outdoor mock battles between Moors and Christians), and versions of Santiagos and Negritos (of Mexico). She also enumerates local parallels in the <strong>sinulog</strong>, <strong>sayaw</strong>, <strong>sugayon</strong>, and <strong>maglalatik</strong>. The chapter ends by introducing Arsenio Rodriguez, one of the pioneer members of Kudyapi Community Theater, who wrote and directed new comedia such as <strong><em>Prinsipe Divino</em></strong> (Divine Prince).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mendoza chronicles her encounters with comedia practitioners in the provinces in part 2. She documents her interview with Mr Cesario Gamboa, who spoke proudly of his acting career as Lizardo, a legendary hero of Pampanga. She describes other comedia like Aklan&rsquo;s sayaw; the comedia in Cuyo, Palawan; and that in Currimao, Ilocos Norte. In the last section, Mendoza gives a brief autobiographical account of how she discovered the comedia, an experience that motivated her to form the Kudyapi Dulaang Munti ng Comedia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In part 3, Mendoza suggests the development of comedia as an Asian traditional drama. She identifies various strategies for consideration: videotape or film documentation of comedia performances; film versions; a comedia library and &ldquo;museum town&rdquo;; an agency devoted to information dissemination about the comedia; comedia translations in English; the inclusion of the comedia in the college curriculum; a comedia center; and most importantly, joint efforts by the community members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 4 contains the dramaturgical notes for <strong><em>Prinsesa Perlita</em></strong> (Princess Perlita), written by Mendoza herself. She critiques the comedia as a dramatic text that has a divisive, lengthy, and ahistorical plot, and explains how she transformed the old text into new material. <strong><em>Prinsesa Perlita, Isang <strong>Komedya</strong>ng Makabayan</em></strong> (Princess Perlita, A Nationalist Komedya), based on <strong><em>Sa Dakong Silangan</em></strong> (In the East), a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romance</a> written by <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5225\">Jose Corazon de Jesus</a>, was the first comedia performed at the <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/289\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a>. Mendoza includes the script in both Filipino and English, along with other scripts.

At the time of composition, he covered a number of komedya theater productions in <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\">Teatro</a> Rizal, mentioning titles like <strong><em>Don Juan Ti&ntilde;oso</em></strong>, <strong><em>Jason at Medea</em></strong> (Jason and Medea), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1880\"><strong><em>Ibong <strong>Adarna</strong></em></strong></a> (Adarna Bird), and <strong><em>Amazonas</em></strong>.

Section 1 reveals context of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s dismissal of some members of his <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> theater company because they appeared in komedya productions. De los Reyes granted Reyes the right to dismiss disloyal company members, but said that if this was done against belief in the komedya as genre, then he would register his objections. To de los Reyes, although the komedya had been introduced by the Spaniards, its character had become markedly different and truly Filipino&mdash;<em>ang tunay na&nbsp;</em>(the true) Tagalog theater&mdash;not to be abolished, but bolstered. In section 2, he argued the rootedness of the komedya to the indigenous, citing the similarities of the komedya to Japanese and Chinese theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beyond the komedya, sections 3 and 4 highlight other genres of the period, particularly the sarsuwela. In both the komedya and sarsuwela, de los Reyes underscored the originality and unique Tagalog sensibility of the artists. While acknowledging shortcomings on the dramaturgical and staging aspects, he asserted that Filipinos did not simply imitate but improved on the original Spanish models. In section 5, de los Reyes posited this metaphor of the komedya: &ldquo;para sa isang castilang gumuhit sa papel ng isang sasacyan at tayong mga tagalog ang gumawa sa sasacyan sa ating sariling dunong, at ugali at atin ding lahat ang ginamit, cahoy, bacal, tali, atbp&rdquo; (it is as if a Spaniard sketched on paper a vehicle, and we Tagalog constructed the vehicle with our own wisdom and ways, and using our own wood, steel, ropes, etc.).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the komedya&rsquo;s weak points, de los Reyes blamed <strong>empresarios</strong> (producers) for neglecting to provide adequate training for the artists and foregrounding profit. He pointed out the need for masters of the art as trainers, those up-to-date on the theater of Europe and elsewhere. In section 6, he listed aspects of the komedya to be retained and developed: the mythical and magical mode, the choreographed marches and battles, and the <strong>tono</strong> or stylized delivery of lines. A longer list of aspects for improvement cited better conduct for the <strong>pusong</strong> (trickster), faster costume changes, finer writing and acting skills, better musical accompaniment, and professionalism and discipline for artists. In section 7, de los Reyes pushed for the use of &ldquo;comedia&rdquo; as opposed to the more popular &ldquo; <strong>moro-moro</strong>.&rdquo; He mentioned as exemplary the actors, writer, director, and impresario of Teatro Rizal.

Manila: Far Eastern University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is a collection of all 39 poems of <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&mdash;from his preadolescent &ldquo;Sa Aking mga Kabata&rdquo; (To My Childhood Companions) to the poem presumably written on the eve of his execution, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1911\">Mi Ultimo Adios</a>&rdquo; (My Last Farewell)&mdash;and his three plays. The poems, arranged in chronological order, are presented with the English translations facing the original texts, which, with the exception of two, were written in Spanish. The plays appear in their English translations only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plays are <strong><em>San Eustaquio, Martir</em></strong> (Saint Eustachius, Martyr), a tragedy in five acts about the martyrdom of a Roman general; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/532\"><strong><em>El Consejo de los Dioses</em></strong></a> (The Council of the Gods), an allegory in one act and a glorification of Cervantes; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/575\"><strong><em>Junto al Pasig</em></strong></a> (Beside the Pasig), a <strong>zarzuela</strong> with the themes of Christianity versus paganism and innocence against evil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of Rizal&rsquo;s plays were authored before he turned 20. At 14, he had written <strong><em>San Eustaquio</em></strong>. His professor Fr Francisco Sanchez, who had translated it from the original Italian to Spanish prose, encouraged him to write it in Spanish verse. At the beginning of the manuscript is Rizal&rsquo;s note to readers, where he humbly apologizes for what he claims as a poor translation of this play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two other plays were written when Rizal was a 19-year-old student at the University of Santo Tomas. <strong><em>El Consejo</em></strong> was his winning entry in the annual literary contest of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5449\">Liceo Artistico Literario</a> de Manila. Joaquin declares this the most sensuous of Rizal&rsquo;s writings. <strong><em>Junto</em></strong> was written for a performance during the feast of the Immaculate Conception in Ateneo de Manila University. With the native scene of a fluvial procession of the Virgin of Antipolo, it reflects the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> side of Rizal. Joaquin claims it as the crowning achievement of Rizal&rsquo;s early period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his signature style, Joaquin is able to provide in his foreword, &ldquo;Rizal the Bard,&rdquo; the pictures of Rizal as a boy in love with poetry, consumed by ambition, and changed by events in his environment. He suggests that Rizal&rsquo;s literature is an unconscious depiction of his dreams and prophecies. One such prophecy is that of his own death, a fate he assigned to Elias and Simoun, his characters in the novels <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Touch Me Not) and <strong><em><strong><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1734\"><strong>El Filibusterismo</strong></a></strong></em></strong> (Subversion).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joaquin also produces an evaluation of Rizal&rsquo;s works. He divides into periods Rizal&rsquo;s production age. The early period, notably Rizal&rsquo;s most productive, covers the bard&rsquo;s youthful writing before he moved to Spain. The plays <strong><em>San Eustaquio</em></strong> and <strong><em>Junto</em></strong> are among the jewels of this period, Joaquin notes. The middle period includes Rizal&rsquo;s writings during his stay in Europe; Joaquin observes changes in the poet&rsquo;s style as he embraces the looser, less traditional forms of poetry in the continent. The final period includes work that ultimately locates Rizal&rsquo;s role in the making of the revolution. It is also said to have been the period that Rizal retreated to mellower scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joaquin provides notes on his translations as well as other pertinent information, in the form of guides and references for the readers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Jose Rizal is among the most documented writers in Philippine literature, Joaquin&rsquo;s rendering distinguishes this book from others. He provides superb translations for Rizal&rsquo;s works, and interprets them in a manner that reveals the bard&rsquo;s own psyche, dilemma, and manifesto. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Ma.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2755\">Glecy C. Atienza</a>. College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dissertation argues for <strong>improbisasyon</strong> (improvisation) as an important aspect of Philippine political theater. Written by Glecy C. Atienza for her doctoral degree in Filipino (Panitikan [Literature]), the study implies that improbisasyon is an unrecognized but important element in <strong>dula</strong> (Philippine drama). The arguments are based on Atienza&rsquo;s active participation in and observation of the different improvisational performances between 1970 and 1992. Atienza notes the significance of the period, as the concept and practice of improvisation became widely popular in the archipelago at this time, particularly in the political theater scene of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atienza documents how improbisasyon became a central force in Philippine theater, noting its power to mirror Philippine society. The theoretical argument of the dissertation segues into an analysis of the textual implication of improbisasyon in the completion of drama. As Atienza posits, there is a persistency of text in improbisasyon despite the absence of an actual literary form (drama). In this regard, the dissertation is also a critique of the canonization of the written drama as the end-all of theater. Atienza celebrates the absence of text in improbisasyon as a manifestation of an active presence. Hence, she argues for what she calls <strong>kontra estado</strong> (against the status quo) of the canon through a proposal of the spontaneous creations of events, buffoonery, satire, and <strong>talinghaga</strong> (figurative expressions) as the foundation of a Philippine dramatic aesthetics and politics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atienza&rsquo;s study comprises three chapters. The first chapter maps the theoretical and analytical lens of the study, anchored on the question &ldquo;Saan ilulugar ang improbisasyon sa karanasang pandula?&rdquo; (Where is improvisation in the theatrical experience?). Chapter 1 links the <strong>teksto</strong> (text), <strong>pagsasadula</strong> (staging), and <strong>proseso</strong> (rehearsal) as central idioms in the construction of <strong>ganap</strong> (event), the motif of improbisasyon. This juxtaposition emphasizes the continuous change and the persistency of experimentation in political theater making, which are asserted as the <strong>tanging tiyak</strong> (constant) in improbisasyon. Here, Atienza also illustrates her criticism against the persistency of the written text in the theater. To celebrate the power of improbisasyon as the persistent absent-present, she looks back to the oral tradition of the Philippines and the tradition of improvisation in some theater forms introduced in the colonial periods, such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>. In doing so, Atienza implies that the bias toward the written text as the end-all of theater springs from the legacy of colonialism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 is an in-depth analysis and a close reading of different improbisasyon performances from 1970 to 1992. In chapter 3, the final chapter, Atienza frames improvisation as a political tool for the foundation of aesthetics in Philippine drama. She highlights improbisasyon as a key feature toward the identification of Philippine theater ontology via a discussion of how improbisasyon is constantly used by Filipino artists in the writing of drama and the staging of plays, and how the sanctity or sacredness of the written text disappears in the history of Philippine theater. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3312\">Sir Anril P.

		"text": "<p>Published 2009. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2991\">Daisy Hontiveros Avellana</a>. Pasig City: Anvil Publishing Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this autobiography, Daisy Hontiveros Avellana writes about her husband, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/4/4282\">Lamberto Avellana</a>, as well as about early Philippine theater and film. The two have been recognized as National Artists for committing their lives to the development of Philippine theater and film from the 1930s to the 1990s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1938, the Avellanas and 50 friends founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2769\">Barangay Theater Guild</a> (BTG) because they believed in &ldquo;the great art of theatre&rdquo; and &ldquo;the Filipino artistic heritage.&rdquo; During the Japanese occupation, BTG produced legitimate three-act plays in Filipino in movie houses emptied by the Japanese ban on films. After the war, BTG provided quality programming on radio through weekly readings of local and foreign plays. Daisy Avellana&rsquo;s grief over her father&rsquo;s death became the creative wellspring for her movie script of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5402\">Nick Joaquin</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\"><strong><em><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></em></strong></a>, the Avellanas&rsquo; &ldquo;legacy to Philippine theater.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The seven chapters of this autobiography are supported by folios on her early writing as well as by photographs on theater, film, and family. In the early writing folio, Daisy Avellana, also an award-winning short story writer, narrates how her family survived the Japanese occupation. She recalls the continuous evacuation of parents and children from one house to another, taking refuge in a church or a burnt home, the hazardous birth of her child, the scarcity of food, the near execution of her husband, the insane and the upright among the enemy. She is awed by the courage and greatness of Filipino guerrillas. The film folio shows the multi-awarded Bert Avellana passionately at work in theater and film and appealing for support of quality films and the creation of a genuine Philippine cinema. In the 67 films he directed, Bert Avellana tried to eschew vacuous popular melodrama and introduce national issues. He pioneered realistic Philippine cinema, beginning with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1275\"><strong><em>Sakay</em></strong></a>, 1939, then moving on to the internationally acclaimed <strong><em>Kandelerong Pilak</em></strong> (Silver Candlesticks), 1954, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1104\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> Dalita</em></strong></a> (<strong><em>The Ruins</em></strong>), 1956, and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a></em></strong>, 1957, and culminating with <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/4/24/1267\"><strong><em>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</em></strong></a>, 1965.

In the early writing folio, Daisy Avellana, also an award-winning short story writer, narrates how her family survived the Japanese occupation. She recalls the continuous evacuation of parents and children from one house to another, taking refuge in a church or a burnt home, the hazardous birth of her child, the scarcity of food, the near execution of her husband, the insane and the upright among the enemy. She is awed by the courage and greatness of Filipino guerrillas. The film folio shows the multi-awarded Bert Avellana passionately at work in theater and film and appealing for support of quality films and the creation of a genuine Philippine cinema. In the 67 films he directed, Bert Avellana tried to eschew vacuous popular melodrama and introduce national issues. He pioneered realistic Philippine cinema, beginning with <a href=\"/4/24/1275\"><strong><em>Sakay</em></strong></a>, 1939, then moving on to the internationally acclaimed <strong><em>Kandelerong Pilak</em></strong> (Silver Candlesticks), 1954, <a href=\"/4/24/1104\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> Dalita</em></strong></a> (<strong><em>The Ruins</em></strong>), 1956, and <strong><em><a href=\"/4/24/1109\"><strong>Badjao</strong></a></em></strong>, 1957, and culminating with <a href=\"/4/24/1267\"><strong><em>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</em></strong></a>, 1965.

Respeto</a>. College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman. 2 volumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first of Respeto&rsquo;s two volumes serves as the main study, analyzing the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a>, a genre of Philippine theater that flourished alongside the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> in the early decades of American colonialism. This covers the <strong>dramang Tagalog</strong> (<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> drama) from its rise in 1899 to its decline in 1944. The second volume anthologizes 56 drama synopses and 10 drama texts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the first volume&rsquo;s introductory chapter, chapter 2 traces the urbanization of Manila by the American colonial government and its attendant social programs. Colonial influence permeated the public school system, in the use of English as medium of instruction; was the foundation of new sets of values and moral standards for men and women; and shaped economic orientations and political policies like the system of free enterprise, which led to the rise of labor unions, and the continuing persecution of revolutionaries, labeled &ldquo;brigands.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3 discusses popular theater forms during the late Spanish and early American periods: the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, the Spanish <strong>zarzuela</strong> and European opera, and the <strong>dulang panrelihiyon</strong> (religious plays) like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within chapter 4 are the biographies and works of 17 drama playwrights, among them <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3202\">Tomas Remigio</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2998\">Hermogenes Ilagan</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3215\">Jose Ma.

Because these dramatists witnessed the same crucial events in Philippine history and shared a common social and cultural milieu, their plays exhibit similarities in subject matter (relationships of parents and children, of husbands and wives; romantic love; abuses during the Spanish period; the Philippine revolution; American exploitation of the Philippine economy; politics under American occupation), as well as theme (parental love, unity in the family, love of country, search for freedom).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5 defines the &ldquo;drama&rdquo; as the genre of Tagalog theater written in prose and/or verse, which tackles everyday lives and social issues. The drama&rsquo;s dialogue is spoken, differing from the music of the sarsuwela and the opera. Antecedents of the drama comprise the Spanish dramas of the 19th century, such as Manuel Lorenzo D&rsquo;Ayot&rsquo;s <strong><em>El Poder de Una Pasion</em></strong> (The Power of Passion), 1886, as well as the opera, <strong>sainete</strong>, <strong>entremes</strong>, and komedya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 6 differentiates two types of the dramang Tagalog, the <strong>drama alegoriko</strong> (allegorical drama) and the <strong>drama historikal</strong> (historical drama).

The documentary mentions the main dramatic forms during the four periods in the development of theater. These are the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/73\">mimetic dances</a>, and customs of the indigenous period; the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, and religious <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/433#playlets\">playlets</a> of the Spanish period; the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>, and English plays of the American period; and the realistic and nonrealistic plays of the contemporary period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part, <strong><em>Dulaan: A Documentary on Ethnic Theater</em></strong>, 1992, attempts to describe the indigenous theater forms that continue to exist among the ethnolinguistic groups of the Philippines today. These include rituals like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/34\"><strong>atang-atang</strong></a> in Isabela; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/432#mimeticdance\">mimetic dances</a> like the <strong>kadal blilah</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2376\">Tboli</a> of South Cotabato and <strong>bumbuwak</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2343\">Gaddang</a>; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/54/432#mimeticcustoms\">mimetic customs</a> like the <strong>sinuhon no bata</strong> in Kitataw, Bukidnon; and short mimetic narratives like the <strong>binabayani</strong> in Pampanga and the <strong>panonoroon</strong> of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2365\">Maranao</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third documentary, <strong><em>Dulaan: A Documentary on the Spanish Influence on Philippine Theater</em></strong>, 1996, highlights the theater forms introduced to and assimilated by Filipinos during the Spanish period. The documentary focuses on five theater forms: the komedya, religious playlets, sinakulo, sarsuwela, and drama. The komedya featured are the <strong><em><strong>Komedya</strong> de San Miguel</em></strong> (The Play of San Miguel) in Iligan and <strong><em>Komedya sa Quezon</em></strong> (Play in Quezon). Playlets shown in the documentary include the <strong>palo-palo</strong> in Ivana, Batanes; <strong>kinabayo</strong> in <strong>Zamboanga</strong> del Norte; <strong>sayaw</strong> in Aklan; and Christmas <strong>kagharong</strong> in Baao, Camarines Sur. Examples of lenten playlets are the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/461\"><strong>osana</strong></a> in Plaridel, Bulacan; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> or <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/483\"><strong>via crucis</strong></a> in Paete, Laguna; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/462\"><strong>paghuhugas ng paa</strong></a> in Gasan, Marinduque; <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/476\"><strong>soledad</strong></a> in Manaoag, Pangasinan; <strong>araquio</strong> in Pe&ntilde;aranda, Nueva Ecija; <strong>pagsunog kay <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/454\"><strong>Hudas</strong></a></strong> in Mexico, Pampanga; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/459\"><strong>moriones</strong></a> in Gasan, Boac, and Mogpog, Marinduque. The long and short sinakulo is exemplified in several Luzon provinces. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\">Sarsuwela</a> include <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/686\"><strong>Walang Sugat</strong></a></em></strong> (No Wounds), 1902, and the contemporary sarsuwela in Bantay, Ilocos Sur.

Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is part of the Panitikan series, a project involving the translation of various Philippine regional literatures into the national language with the aim of broadening the scope of Philippine literature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his introduction to the book, Mojares locates the birth of modern <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> theater within its origins from the Spanish period up to the early decades of the American period. Mojares begins his narrative with the performance of religious <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">rituals</a> that bore the essential elements of theater upon the arrival of Magellan in 1521 and Legaspi in 1565, and the staging of a <strong>comedia Castellana</strong> (Castilian comedy) written by the Jesuit Francisco Vicente Puche, coinciding with the inauguration of a grammar school. Mojares notes the dearth of information about the development of Cebu theater in the next two and a half centuries. He surmises nevertheless that there were performances of religious plays in the more affluent towns of the province, while traditional forms of theater, such as the indigenous <strong>kolasisi</strong> and <strong>balitaw</strong>, persisted in homes and in peripheral communities. The latter part of the 19th century saw a more dynamic theater scene as a result of the economic progress from the opening of the Cebu port to foreign traders in 1869. This was followed by the introduction of the <strong>zarzuelang Espanyol</strong> (Spanish zarzuela) and the establishment of the Teatro Junquera, which became the main venue of many Spanish zarzuelas and, later, modern plays in Cebuano.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A vibrant theater form that emerged in areas outside the city was the <strong>linambay</strong> or <strong>moro-moro</strong>. One community that nurtured this tradition was Valladolid. Mojares traces the development of the form in Valladolid to the transformation of a Spanish narrative titled &ldquo;Alimpatar&rdquo; into a linambay. The staging required 100 characters, various&nbsp;<em>halimaw&nbsp;</em>(monsters) and mythical creatures, colorful costumes, an orchestra, and nine nights of presentation. The scope of the production was such that the entire community had to participate in the mounting of the play&mdash;a communal work of theater that consolidated the community. The linambay flourished in various parts of Cebu up to the 1930s. Mojares asserts that as a vehicle of moral and social consciousness, the linambay was limited since the situations it presented were foreign and unrealistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mojares continues that it is within this context that the modern Cebuano theater emerged. <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5707\">Vicente Sotto</a> was at the forefront of this new development, criticizing the religious plays and the linambay. He wrote <strong><em>Ang&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Paghigugma sa Yuta nga Nataohon</em></strong> (Love for the Native Land) in 1902, which, according to Mojares, launched the Cebuano realistic drama. He founded the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2848\">Compania de Aficionados</a>, which aimed to create an alternative theater to the Spanish zarzuela and the linambay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The four plays anthologized by Alburo and Mojares offer a glimpse of the features of Cebuano modern theater, which thrived in the early decades of the 20th century. The play <strong><em>Ang Paghigugma sa Yuta nga Nataohan</em></strong> by Sotto parallels the anticlerical <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Rizal</a> novels. <strong><em>Asawa sa Usa ka Sugarol</em></strong> (The Gambler&rsquo;s Wife), 1914, by Ismael Paras criticizes vices, particularly cockfighting. <strong><em>Mini</em></strong> (The Fake), 1925, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3221\">Buenaventura Rodriguez</a> adheres to the romantic notion that love overcomes class differences. <strong><em>Rajah Hamabar</em></strong>, 1960, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5155\">Potenciano Canizares Jr</a> dramatizes the history of Cebu before the Spanish colonization.

With financial help from the&nbsp;<em>samahan&nbsp;</em>(collective), Jose leaves for the city and returns to the town six years later a lawyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Bunal</em></strong> is a satire on the ways of the avaricious. Gerundio returns from Havana an inept lawyer and a snob, a stranger to the native language, and an ignoramus in any form of employment. Felicuda is his equally indolent and haughty sister who abuses the helpers. Intermittently out of work, Gerundio wastes his father&rsquo;s wealth, amassed through theft and usury. Ranged against them is the family of Pacifico Prudente, an honest workman, an affectionate father, and a kind master, whosefortunes&mdash;despitethe odds&mdash;turnout rather well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Balay ni Bilay Hilay</em></strong> (Bilay&rsquo;s House is Tottery) by Joel R. Arbolario is a comico-allegorical piece of street theater criticizing Philippine-American relations. The wobbly house stands for the Philippines; &rsquo;Nyora Inday Luisita vda de Mia stands for the local leadership conniving with the&nbsp;<em>guwapong Kano&nbsp;</em>(handsome American) and the&nbsp;<em>Heneral&nbsp;</em>(literally, the general; allegorically, the military).&nbsp;<em>Lalaki&nbsp;</em>(Man) and&nbsp;<em>Babae&nbsp;</em>(Woman), representing the common Filipino, at one point called &ldquo;the shits of oursociety,&rdquo; areforcibly driven out of their barangay for a factory, because as &rsquo;Nyora Inday&rsquo;s servant Menggay says: &ldquo;We need more dollar money, money /So that our&nbsp;<em>utang&nbsp;</em>[debt] we can pay.&rdquo; In theend, the play exhorts everyone to join hands and rebuild the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though written between 1916 and 1988, theplays anthologized and translated raise issues as relevant and contemporary as any dramatic piece being staged today. They are a testament to the vigor of Hiligaynon literature. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Manila: Institute of National Language.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essay, originally a lecture delivered by Balmaseda on 8 Sep 1943, follows the theme of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>&rsquo;s earlier discourse, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/712\"><strong>Dulang Tagalog</strong></a></em></strong> (<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> Theater), which asserts that an indigenous and distinct Filipino theater existed before the arrival of the Spaniards. Building on Reyes&rsquo;s arguments, Balmaseda enumerates local terms representing native theater forms like the <strong>karagatan</strong>, <strong>papuri</strong>, <strong>sabalan</strong>, <strong>pananapatan</strong>, <strong>tibaw</strong>, and <strong>tagayan</strong>, proof of a flourishing pre-Hispanic theater tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balmaseda points to the propagation of Christianity as context for the development of Tagalog theater during the Spanish period. From the colonizer&rsquo;s goal of spreading a new faith emerged a new theater form, the <strong>dulang pampananampalataya</strong> (religious theater). The first example of such a play, <strong><em>Pagpapakasakit kay Santa Barbara</em></strong> (Sacrifice for Saint Barbara), was presented in Bohol in 1609 by the Jesuits. Soon after Filipinos underwent various rituals and received lessons in Christianity, they created their own religious plays. Among them were <strong><em>Pagpugot kay Longinos</em></strong> (Beheading of Longinus) in Bulacan, which mentioned Jesus&rsquo;s crucifixion, and the <strong>tibag</strong>, or the dramatization of the tearing down of Mount Calvary to search for the cross on which Christ died. Balmaseda also notes the popularity of the <strong>comedia de capa y espada</strong> in Spain during the time. These plays were models for Filipino dramatists. Due to the intervention of the Spanish friars, they always concluded with the Christians winning over the Moors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balmaseda highlights the criticism from some Filipino writers of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>. One of the earliest was <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5085\">Francisco Balagtas</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/565\"><strong><em>La India Elegante y el Negrito Amante</em></strong></a> (The Elegant Indian Woman and the Negrito Suitor), his effort to introduce a new kind of play. Even in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Touch Me Not), the local leaders, in their meeting at the town hall of San Diego, denounced the komedya because there was nothing to learn from it, and instead suggested the mounting of plays that depicted Filipino customs. Nevertheless, Balmaseda acknowledges the signature of plays written by Balagtas, such as <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/629\"><strong>Orosman at Zafira</strong></a></em></strong> (Orosman and Zafira), <strong><em>Abdal at Miserena</em></strong> (Abdal and Miserena), <strong><em>Bayaceto at Darlisca</em></strong> (Bayaceto and Darlisca), and <strong><em>Almansor at Rosalina</em></strong> (Almansor and Rosalina), in which the moral ascendancy of the non-Christians are implied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the breakout of the Philippine-American War, there was a short hiatus for Tagalog theater. Then a new kind of theater emerged during the American period&mdash;plays that embodied the &ldquo;<em>diwang mapanghimagsik</em>&rdquo; (revolutionary spirit).

What resulted from this was a number of plays that Balmaseda calls <strong>dulang pangkaugalian</strong>, or plays that focused on the theme of love and depicted the customs and inclinations of the people, but did not necessarily allude directly to political issues. Meanwhile, the <strong>moro-moro</strong> or komedya&rsquo;s popularity waned when theater groups shifted to new forms such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tagalog theater suffered another period of decline, which Balmaseda attributes to economic issues.

It belongs to the tradition of colonialist criticism of Philippine literature, which denigrates native writings to prove that the Filipino &ldquo;belongs to the lower class of humanity,&rdquo; thus making him fit for nothing but subjugation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book comprises 11 chapters. Chapter 1 describes the &ldquo;literary characteristics&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Filipino tribes&rdquo; and concludes that &ldquo;there is no Filipino literature.&rdquo; Chapter 2 identifies the mythological images and figures used in the Filipino drama, the &ldquo;only department of literature in which the Filipino has done anything worthy of mention,&rdquo; and evidence of the superstitious nature of the &ldquo;tribesmen.&rdquo; Chapter 3 traces the development of the genre from the pre-Hispanic to the American period and divides the subject into four subgenres: the prehistoric, the religious, the <strong>moro-moro</strong>, and the seditious or revolutionary drama. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss the evolution of the seditious drama, which the author considers &ldquo;interesting and instructive.&rdquo; Riggs argues that the moro-moro, which features the Christian and Muslim conflict, was the model of the seditious play, as both plays show the efforts of the &ldquo;aborigine to throw off the yoke of the invader, who seemed to his distorted imagination to be a most grievous oppressor.&rdquo; Chapters 6-11 showcase five of the so-called seditious plays&mdash; <strong><em><strong>Luha</strong>ng Tagalog</em></strong> (<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> Tears) by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/595\"><strong>Malaya</strong></a></em></strong> (Free) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3202\">Tomas Remigio</a>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/673\"><strong>Tanikalang Guinto</strong></a></em></strong> (Golden Chain) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2711\">Juan Abad</a>, <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/560\"><strong>Hindi Aco Patay</strong></a></em></strong> (I Am Not Dead) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2862\">Juan Matapang Cruz</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/578\"><strong><em>Kahapon, Ngayon at Bukas</em></strong></a> (Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow) by Aurelio Tolentino&mdash;and an opera, <strong><em>Magdapio</em></strong>, by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/80/5576\">Pedro Paterno</a>.

Department of Southeast Asian Studies, National University of Singapore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dissertation analyzes the development of the <strong>moro-moro</strong> or the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, a traditional Philippine theater form revolving around the religious conflicts between Christians (particularly Catholics) and Muslims, usually performed in rural areas in the archipelago. The focus of the dissertation is the <strong>batalla</strong>, or the dance element of the theater form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Briones proposes &ldquo;choreographic logic&rdquo; as a useful idiom for the understanding of the batalla in the moro-moro. Close attention is paid to the structure, composition, production, and consumption of the batalla. Using this idiom, Briones links the present performances of the komedya to the performances during the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines. Choreographic logic is also Briones&rsquo;s strategy to illustrate the affinity of the moro-moro to Southeast Asian theater traditions and its rootedness to what she calls &ldquo;indigenous aesthetic sensibilities.&rdquo; The study asserts that the moro-moro is not only a mimicry and an import of the Spanish <strong>comedia</strong> but an authentic Filipino theater tradition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dissertation comprises seven chapters and a conclusion. Chapter 1 is a general introduction, which includes a historical overview of the theater form and a glimpse of academic literature covering the subject. In chapter 2, Briones explains why she uses &ldquo;moro-moro&rdquo; as opposed to &ldquo;komedya&rdquo; in exclusively referring to this theater form. She expounds that the moro-moro is rooted in the indigenous, covering a variety of native war dances in the archipelago, and has a direct link to other performance genres in Southeast Asia. Chapters 3-5 elaborate her arguments on the authenticity of the moro-moro as a Filipino performance form. Briones illustrates how modes of composition, delivery, and consumption of the moro-moro follow the &ldquo;choreographic logic,&rdquo; which she uses to highlight this sense of the &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; in the moro-moro. One particular example is the character of repetition and the monotonous delivery of lines, which are asserted to possess affinity with the chanting traditions of Philippine epics. Another example in the dissertation is the presence of the <strong>dictador</strong> or the prompter-playwright, who, in Briones&rsquo;s arguments, acts as a <strong>bricoleur</strong> &mdash;an expert in collating available stock imagery and scenarios during an actual performance of the moro-moro. The heart of this section is Briones&rsquo;s emphasis on the batalla, which is based on native conceptions of power and the efficaciousness of dance as offering, locally known as <strong>panata</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the contemporary performances of the moro-moro. Briones presents innovations of contemporary troupes in popularizing the form to younger audiences. This is followed by a reimagination of the moro-moro as the national theater form of the Philippines following the logic of early local theater scholars, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen Fernandez</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3316\">Nicanor G.

Carpio uses the imported term even as she refers to the Philippine version of the play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carpio divides the book into four chapters. Chapter 1 traces the early life of Ilagan, from his birth in Bigaa (now Balagtas), Bulacan; his exposure to the music of the church choir in Santa Cruz, Manila, as he was growing up; his theater tours in the provinces; up to the organization of his own sarsuwela troupe, Compania Ilagan, in 1902. Carpio uses interviews with Ilagan&rsquo;s brother, Angel, and writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5642\">Pedrito Reyes</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5757\">Engracio Valmonte</a> to gather anecdotes about the playwright.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 comprises the major part of the study, where the author looks into Ilagan&rsquo;s plays in terms of action, characterization, theme, and style. Thirteen plays are examined here: <strong><em>Bahay ng <strong>Himala</strong>&rsquo;t Kababalaghan</em></strong> (House of Miracles and Mysteries), <strong><em>Dalawang Hangal</em></strong> (Two Fools), <strong><em>Bill de Divorcio</em></strong> (Divorce Bill), <strong><em>Despues de Dios &hellip; El Dinero!</em></strong> (After God &hellip; Money!), <strong><em>Ang Sundalong Kapitan</em></strong> (The Soldier Captain), <strong><em>Venus: Ang <strong>Opera</strong>ng Putol</em></strong> (Venus: The Unfinished Opera), <strong><em>Dalagang Bukid</em></strong> (Country Maiden), <strong><em>Ang Buhay Nga Naman</em></strong> (Such is Life), <strong><em>Ilaw ng Katotohanan</em></strong> (Light of Truth), <strong><em>Ang Sigaw ng Bayan</em></strong> (The Cry of the People), <strong><em>Wagas na Pag-irog</em></strong> (Pure Love), and <strong><em>Panarak ni Rosa</em></strong> (Dagger of Rosa).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3 looks into the stagecraft and production techniques of Ilagan&rsquo;s sarsuwela. Carpio presents Ilagan as a director who was hands-on from the casting of characters to the rehearsals (perhaps the equivalent of present-day workshops), where he would teach voice projection and mastery of dialogue, breathing techniques, the blending of thought and emotion in interpreting roles, the creation of sets, and the use of music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4 summarizes the contribution of Ilagan&rsquo;s sarsuwela to Philippine drama and theater. Carpio regards him as the total showman, having written more than a hundred sarsuwela, which were regarded as both artistic and commercial successes on stage. Carpio reiterates Ilagan&rsquo;s boldness and vision as an artist who explored subjects such as homosexuality, divorce, capitalism, hypocrisy, and even the idea of what a play should be when it veers away from the traditional happy endings for the characters. Carpio cites the sarsuwela <strong><em>Panarak ni Rosa</em></strong> as the most accomplished of all his plays, even if it is not the most popular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book ends with a short conclusion on Ilagan as an artist whose plays are unmistakably marked by social values.

College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This study traces the development of scene design in Philippine theater within its sociocultural context&mdash;from the productions of the Spanish period in Manila, through its modernization under the American period, to the search for a national identity and the rise of the theater institutions in the late 1960s, as represented by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a>, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>, and the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP)</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study covers scene design, as well as costumes and makeup, lights and the lighting effects of selected productions, the milieu of the theater in which these productions were done, and the overall audience effect of each of these elements. Included are information on scene designers, their influences and style, and their roles in production, as well as discussion on the conventions and innovations of specific periods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data were sourced from available photographs, playbills, articles, reviews, or press releases of productions; interviews of theater artists and members of the audience; and archival materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1 presents the objectives, scope, methodology, conceptual framework and approach, and the significance of the study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 introduces theater design in the Spanish period with the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3293\">Teatro de Binondo</a> of 1846, the first formal theater in Manila at that time and a venue for the Spanish <strong>zarzuela</strong> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a>, as well as European <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a>. In the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/5/247\"><strong>teatro</strong></a>, the scenes were framed by the proscenium, and had several <strong>telones</strong> painted in perspective, with the last separating the backstage areas from the action on stage. The chapter also discusses design for Philippine theater forms such as the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\"><strong>drama simboliko</strong></a>.

Tiongson</a>. Manila: Integrated Research Center, De La Salle University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first work to bring together historical documentation and field data in order to limn the history of a Philippine theater form, <strong><em>Kasaysayan ng Komedya</em></strong> traces the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> from its Spanish sources&mdash;the <strong>comedia de santo</strong>, <strong>de capa y espada</strong>, <strong>a fantasia</strong> &mdash;and beginnings in the Spanish language, to the present. Its growth and development are divided into three periods: early growth in 1766-1820; first flowering in 1820-96; seasons of public attack in 1878-1920; and a second flowering in 1900-1982.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The period of first growth is fleshed out from the accounts of European travelers, priests, and scholars&mdash;de Morga, Colin, Delgado, Martinez de Zu&ntilde;iga, Le Gentil and, of course, Retana&mdash;and from the work of Filipino writers on the period, such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3215\">Jose Ma. Rivera</a> on Huseng Sisiw. The piecing together of information shows the form taking its Filipino shape: stories written in verse, imbued with magical elements, featuring royal battles and romances, with prince heroes and clowns as major characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first flowering of the komedya is shown to have come about because of the confluence of cosmopolitanization, urbanization, and Christianization in the 19th century. The accounts of eyewitnesses and current scholars show that the stories are clearly traceable to Spanish <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>, and that the play had by then been well established in different regions: Manila, Pampanga, Bicol, Ilocos, Antique, Iloilo, and Cebu. It was most frequently staged at town fiestas; there were theaters dedicated to it; and it had built up a dramaturgy, staging conventions, and an audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the third period, the komedya came under attack from writers influenced by the new liberalism, wafted from Spain by clashes between conservatives and liberals, and by the realism brought in by new plays and by education. The reform movement and the revolution against Spain made the educated attack the komedya even more, for being ignorant, unrealistic, and full of fantasy&mdash;and thus unable to purvey the truth expected of theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiongson sees a second flowering of the komedya in the 20th century. They were staged and revived in different regions&mdash;spreading where migration took their <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> writers/audiences (e.g., Mindanao); they confirmed and developed the form already set. The form waned, however, in some regions, like Manila, because of competition from more realistic forms, like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, and the impact of education and mass media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiongson concludes that the komedya cannot be said to have died in Philippine theater. It is a traditional drama form that still flourishes in many regions at community level. It has been reshaped by modern perceptions and practices, and survives, and can well be called a de facto national form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is illustrated with photographs and drawings old and new, and ends with an extensive bibliography and an appendix: the complete script of <strong><em>Comedia</em></strong> <em><strong>Famosa&nbsp;</strong><strong>Vida&nbsp;</strong><strong>de&nbsp;</strong><strong>Atamante</strong> </em>as written by Manuel Roque of Paete, Laguna, in 1910. Since few komedya were ever published and the Atamante story is so popular that it has versions in most regions, this is a treasure for the scholar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pioneering work does not only trace the history and development of the komedya but also shows the place taken by the komedya within community life, and its value as a theater form entrenched in Philippine folk perception and taste. It won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5489\">Manila Critics Circle</a> National Book Award for literary criticism in 1983. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Doreen G.

Rivera</a> on Huseng Sisiw. The piecing together of information shows the form taking its Filipino shape: stories written in verse, imbued with magical elements, featuring royal battles and romances, with prince heroes and clowns as major characters."

				"value": "The first flowering of the komedya is shown to have come about because of the confluence of cosmopolitanization, urbanization, and Christianization in the 19th century. The accounts of eyewitnesses and current scholars show that the stories are clearly traceable to Spanish <a href=\"/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>, and that the play had by then been well established in different regions: Manila, Pampanga, Bicol, Ilocos, Antique, Iloilo, and Cebu. It was most frequently staged at town fiestas; there were theaters dedicated to it; and it had built up a dramaturgy, staging conventions, and an audience."

				"value": "In the third period, the komedya came under attack from writers influenced by the new liberalism, wafted from Spain by clashes between conservatives and liberals, and by the realism brought in by new plays and by education. The reform movement and the revolution against Spain made the educated attack the komedya even more, for being ignorant, unrealistic, and full of fantasy&#x2014;and thus unable to purvey the truth expected of theater."

They were staged and revived in different regions&#x2014;spreading where migration took their <a href=\"/1/2/2348\">Ilocano</a> and <a href=\"/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> writers/audiences (e.g., Mindanao); they confirmed and developed the form already set. The form waned, however, in some regions, like Manila, because of competition from more realistic forms, like the <a href=\"/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, and the impact of education and mass media."
			},
			{
				"type": "paragraph",
				"value": "Tiongson concludes that the komedya cannot be said to have died in Philippine theater. It is a traditional drama form that still flourishes in many regions at community level. It has been reshaped by modern perceptions and practices, and survives, and can well be called a de facto national form."

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Philippine Theatre: History and Anthology</em></strong> was originally planned as a five-volume series, introducing Philippine theater traditions to scholars, students, and academics in theater and performance studies, Philippine studies, literary studies, art studies, area studies, and other related disciplines. Of the five proposed volumes, the University of the Philippines Press published two in 1999: <strong><em>Volume II: <strong>Komedya</strong></em></strong> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/59/743\"><strong><em>Volume III: <strong>Sinakulo</strong></em></strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second volume is dedicated to the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, a theatrical form introduced by the Spaniards during the colonization of the islands and whose plots generally revolve around the sociocultural and religious conflicts of the Christians and the Muslims in medieval Europe. To date, this volume is the only academic reference providing a comprehensive historical account and descriptive information about this traditional theater form. The book is divided into three parts: the first part consisting of a general essay on the komedya and the next two parts devoted to the introduction and documentation of two present-day komedya performances in the regions: (1) a <strong>komedya de santo</strong>, or komedya on the life of a saint; and (2) a komedya/<strong>moro-moro</strong>, or komedya highlighting the conflict between Christians and Moors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The general essay presents a comprehensive introduction to the form discussing the history, script, production, themes, and contemporary productions of the komedya. In the historical overview, Tiongson traces its origins to the Hispanic <strong>comedia</strong>, illustrates how the comedia was transformed or Filipinized into the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> komedya, and how it eventually spread to the different regions. This section ends with a descriptive narration of the komedya&rsquo;s survival throughout the archipelago despite the rise of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> (a <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musical</a> form also introduced by the Spaniards) and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> in the first decades of the 20th century and the coming of modernity in the islands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 2 is a general overview of the <strong>orihinal</strong>, the script of the komedya. It discusses the main sources of the komedya&mdash;namely, the&nbsp;<em>awit&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>korido&nbsp;</em>or <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1555\">metrical romances</a>, from which the komedya derived both its stories, verse forms, and colonial messages&mdash;and the staple characters of the komedya, which present a strict hierarchy on both the Christian and Muslim sides. It ends with a definition and illustration of the two types of komedya: the religious, which could focus on the life of a saint, an episode in the life of Christ, or a miracle wrought by a saint or holy figure; and the secular komedya, or moro-moro, which could narrate the search for the Santa Cruz by Elena and Constantino, the love and conflict between princes and princesses of warring kingdoms, and stories based on Philippine legends, history, or contemporary characters and events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In section 3, Tiongson focuses on the production aspects of the komedya, beginning with the financing and management by individuals and groups who were key figures during a fiesta celebration. These include the <strong>hermano</strong> (or <strong>hermana</strong> if female) and the <strong>comite de festijos</strong>, who sponsor a komedya during a fiesta as the community&rsquo;s offering to their patron saint. Important staging techniques peculiar to the komedya are introduced: single sets whose changes are decorated with specific props, costumes defining religion and hierarchy, <strong>magia</strong> (the magical effects), <strong>dicho</strong> (the delivery of lines), <strong>batalla</strong> (choreographed war dances), the grand <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/784\"><strong>marcha</strong></a> for Christians and Moors, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/81\"><strong>pasa doble</strong></a> for entrances, and <strong>torneo</strong> (duel fighting).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In section 4, Tiongson provides a preliminary close reading of persistent themes<em>&mdash;</em>the traditional conflict between the Christians and the Muslims, and the authoritarian and colonial messages of the komedya. Here, he also explains the reasons for the decline of the komedya&rsquo;s popularity, particularly in relation to the sarsuwela.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section 5 discusses the revitalization of the komedya with positive messages and effective staging techniques by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3285\">Tanghalang Pilipino</a> of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/3950\">Cultural Center of the Philippines</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3028\">Komedya ng San Dionisio</a> in Para&ntilde;aque City. In concluding the general essay, Tiongson proposes that the komedya&mdash;with its 400-year-old history, wide distribution over the archipelago, continuous performances in the islands, and continued revitalization in content and form&mdash;is a pillar of Filipino national theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second and third parts of the book are detailed expositions of current komedya performances in the regions, including introductory essays, performance photographs, details of the marcha and musical scores, and the orihinal in the original vernaculars supplemented by English translations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exemplifying the komedya de santo is the <strong><em>Comedia de San Miguel</em></strong>, popularly known as the <strong>yawa-yawa</strong>, performed annually in Iligan City in the Mindanao region during the community&rsquo;s fiesta for San Miguel on Sep 29. The play, as stated in the introduction by Tiongson and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2937\">Steven Patrick Fernandez</a>, focuses on the story of San Miguel (Saint Michael)&mdash;specifically, on the conflict between Lusbel (loosely translated as Lucifer) and San Miguel. The introduction documents in detail its history, script, production techniques, and significance in the community. Supplementing the essay is a series of performance photographs from the 1992 and 1981 productions. Six performance scores are also presented, including the marcha for Lusbel and San Miguel, and the lively dance of the devils. The bulk of this part is the complete orihinal actually performed in 1992, with annotations by Tiongson. The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2341\">Cebuano</a> text is juxtaposed with an English translation by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5291\">Fernandez</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third and final part of the book presents the <strong>arakyo</strong>, a moro-moro type komedya performed in Pe&ntilde;aranda and other towns of Nueva Ecija. A reenactment of the search of Reyna Elena and her son Constantino for the Santa Cruz or Holy Cross upon which Christ was nailed and died, the arakyo is performed yearly during the month of May on a stage roofed with coconut fronds. The introductory essay by Tiongson explains the history, script, production techniques, and social and personal meaning of the arakyo. Thirty-six scores used for the marcha, pasadoble, and dances are also presented, including folk songs like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/40/858\">&ldquo;Bahay Kubo&rdquo;</a> and popular tunes like &ldquo;Wooden Heart.&rdquo; Supplementing the discussion of this komedya are 17 photographs, 16 of which are from the 1986 production and one from the 1984 production. The performance text of the arakyo documents the 1986 performance, with annotations by Tiongson and juxtaposed with English translation in verse by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5495\">Edgardo Maranan</a>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3312\">Sir Anril P.

College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thesis underscores the ritual characteristic and function of theater in society, particularly the <strong>linambay</strong> of Linao. The study hinges on two main assumptions: that there is a wealth of &ldquo;indigenous modes of production to be tapped and documented,&rdquo; and that there is a &ldquo;need for a theoretical framework or synthesizing thread&rdquo; that would tie the loose materials of the said literary modes into a coherent whole.&rdquo; Martinez notes that Linao&rsquo;s linambay tradition possesses the two essential traits of an ordinary ritual: that a myth serves as a justification of its performance; and that it is performed regularly using what Martinez calls &ldquo;established patterns of tradition mandated by communal rule.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study is divided into six chapters, with each discussing and reflecting on what is ritualistic in Linao&rsquo;s linambay tradition, theatrical performances, and literary texts in general. A chapter is also devoted to the discussion of the genesis of Linao&rsquo;s linambay tradition. The study&rsquo;s appendices contain sample texts and a translation of Francisco Tugonon&rsquo;s play <strong><em>Altivo</em></strong> (1920, 1936, 1946).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1 establishes the theoretical lens of the study. It argues that the study of theater as ritual should involve the use of tools from cultural anthropology, folk history, and folk religion in order to construct a supratext combining the linambay (text) and Linao (context). The use of such tools leads Martinez to the conclusion that the linambay tradition of Linao is indeed performed as a ritual. Chapter 2 serves both as an introduction to the <strong>moro-moro</strong> of Cebu and Leyte and an attempt to trace the origins of Linao&rsquo;s linambay tradition. Here, Martinez describes the historical and societal contexts that served as catalysts for the emergence of linambay in Linao. These contexts also serve as the linambay&rsquo;s links to the moro-moro tradition of Cebu and Leyte. Chapter 3 explains the evolution of Linao&rsquo;s linambay as a village ritual, an activity that manifests a people&rsquo;s solidarity. The chapter comprises four subsections, each focusing on a specific aspect of ritual production, mythmaking, and folk social organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapters 4 and 5 are both further expositions of Martinez&rsquo;s claim that theater and literary texts can be read and experienced as rituals. Chapter 4 identifies what is ritualistic in the staging, directing, acting, and lighting of Linao&rsquo;s linambay tradition. Martinez asserts that audience participation is also a crucial part of the ritual. She implies that the production of linambay is an endeavor where reception has more credence than artistic production itself. This, according to Martinez, explains the persistence of the tradition&rsquo;s anachronistic and formulaic elements, which can be traced back to a privileging of function over form. Chapter 5, on the other hand, illustrates how literary conventions are themselves also rituals that are carried over via repetition of themes, motifs, characters, and plot structures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 6 synthesizes the four perspectives brought forth in the course of the study. The chapter is divided into four subsections, each representing a specific perspective&mdash;namely, &ldquo;<a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\">Ritual</a> versus Social Structure,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Power of Reception over Creation,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Power of Folk Assimilation,&rdquo; and &ldquo;An Ethno-religious Perception of a Folk Hero.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harnessing literary and anthropological tools of analysis, the study is significant for its attempt to establish the relationship between indigenous modes of literary production and the prevailing material conditions that circumscribe them. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Amado Anthony G.

College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Danilo Mandia&rsquo;s study traces the development of the <strong>pagmomoryon</strong> (the act of being a moryon) from the <strong>panata</strong> or solemn and secret oath of suffering to the Poong Maikapal (Lord Creator) to the &ldquo;open offering&rdquo; (&ldquo;<em>pakita sa tao</em>&rdquo;) and &ldquo;show&rdquo; (&ldquo;<em>pakitang-tao</em>&rdquo;), as practiced in the town of Boac, Marinduque. Modernization, commercialization, and the entry of political interests are key factors in the evolution of the traditional pagmomoryon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1 defines the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/459\"><strong>moryon</strong></a> <em>&mdash;</em>from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>morion</em>, meaning &ldquo;helmet&rdquo;&mdash;and the cultural system it embodies. The moryon or pagmomoryon is a spiritual tradition in Marinduque characterized by an oath of penance, similar to that of Christ&rsquo;s suffering&mdash;done as an act of thanksgiving for a good harvest, for deliverance from calamity, or for the granting of personal wishes. For seven days during Lent (except Good Friday), the moryon, usually the menfolk, take to the streets wearing colorful improvised costumes and the moryon mask, carved from the&nbsp;<em>dapdap&nbsp;</em>wood, playing the Roman soldiers who crucified Christ on Pilate&rsquo;s orders. Central to the pagmomoryon is the character Longhino (Longinus), the Roman soldier who pierced Christ&rsquo;s body and later converted to Christianity after the miraculous healing of his blind eye. Longhino&rsquo;s martyrdom is dramatized in the spectacular <strong>pugutan</strong> (beheading).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 2, Mandia locates the pagmomoryon in its performance site, the island of Marinduque. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\">Rituals</a> done in consonance with the pagmomoryon are the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/480\"><strong>tubong</strong></a>, singing to celebrate a child&rsquo;s 7th or 18th birthday; the <strong>kalutang</strong>, playing the bamboo instruments used for the pugutan; the <strong>antipo</strong>, flagellation as a vow for wellness through penitence; and the <strong>habulan</strong>, the chase of Longhino by Roman soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3 unravels the origin of Longhino through a survey of local materials that mention the character, such as souvenir programs, news articles, and the texts of the <strong><em>Pasiong Mahal</em></strong>, which Mandia asserts is the main source of the script of the pugutan. Mandia also details the traditional pugutan ritual of the 1960s and 1970s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 4, Mandia traces the moryon&rsquo;s development in Marinduque during the tenure of Fr Dionisio Santiago in 1870. Local narratives reveal changes in the tradition from the 1960s to the 1990s, indicating as major factors political interests, popular participation, the inclusion of non-Marinduque&ntilde;os, and the commercialization of the moryon. Traditionally, the moryon&rsquo;s identity was undisclosed until after the pugutan, when the community joined Longhino in his celebration. Nowadays, actors who portray Longhino and other known characters might be namedropped by townsfolk through word of mouth. The pugutan script has undergone treatment by well-known playwrights and rehearsed for big productions. Once done in front of houses or any open place, the pugutan is now enacted on a specific stage prepared by sponsors, with other spaces like the church set up for the chase. The pugutan is enhanced by technological innovation, such as elevated stages and sound systems. Rich political patrons even sponsor prizes for the best costume and accessories. Organizations have been put up by the local government to support the pagmomoryon. Commercial activity booms during festival season, and the once solemn and private panata has become a tourist attraction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5 compares the pagmomoryon to the ritual of theater, where an actor embodies his character and piously prepares to impart the message of the work. The moryon solemnly prepares for his oath by creating his own mask, designed according to his own personal predilection. He articulates his own being, and realizes his oath to suffering as within the sanctity of his&nbsp;<em>pagkatawo&nbsp;</em>(being). He is then able to create a world that is apart from the rest&mdash;leaving behind his earthly responsibilities to exclusively bear the physical suffering and social estrangement of becoming a moryon. After seven days, the moryon returns to the world as a <strong>bagong tawo</strong> (new person), marked by the <strong>pagtitikwas ng maskara</strong> (lifting of the mask) to the sky to face the Poong Maikapal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mandia&rsquo;s study also includes short descriptions of the pagmomoryon as practiced in other parts of the island, photographs of the pagmomoryon showcasing the changes through time, as well as transcriptions of interviews with locals who have witnessed the evolution of the pagmomoryon. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2755\">Glecy C.

Central to the pagmomoryon is the character Longhino (Longinus), the Roman soldier who pierced Christ&#x2019;s body and later converted to Christianity after the miraculous healing of his blind eye. Longhino&#x2019;s martyrdom is dramatized in the spectacular <strong>pugutan</strong> (beheading)."

Local narratives reveal changes in the tradition from the 1960s to the 1990s, indicating as major factors political interests, popular participation, the inclusion of non-Marinduque&#xF1;os, and the commercialization of the moryon. Traditionally, the moryon&#x2019;s identity was undisclosed until after the pugutan, when the community joined Longhino in his celebration. Nowadays, actors who portray Longhino and other known characters might be namedropped by townsfolk through word of mouth. The pugutan script has undergone treatment by well-known playwrights and rehearsed for big productions. Once done in front of houses or any open place, the pugutan is now enacted on a specific stage prepared by sponsors, with other spaces like the church set up for the chase. The pugutan is enhanced by technological innovation, such as elevated stages and sound systems. Rich political patrons even sponsor prizes for the best costume and accessories. Organizations have been put up by the local government to support the pagmomoryon. Commercial activity booms during festival season, and the once solemn and private panata has become a tourist attraction."

He is then able to create a world that is apart from the rest&#x2014;leaving behind his earthly responsibilities to exclusively bear the physical suffering and social estrangement of becoming a moryon. After seven days, the moryon returns to the world as a <strong>bagong tawo</strong> (new person), marked by the <strong>pagtitikwas ng maskara</strong> (lifting of the mask) to the sky to face the Poong Maikapal."

		"text": "<p>(From the Wings of the Stage: Poetics of Women&rsquo;s Theater). Published 2006. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5094\">Joi Barrios</a>. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This book, based on Barrios&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation, theorizes on the poetics of Filipino women&rsquo;s theater using archival, empirical, and post-structuralist methodologies in feminist research. Analyzing approximately 100 stage plays produced by different theater groups across the country, written by both men and women in English, Filipino, and other regional languages since the early 1900s, the author traces the history of women&rsquo;s theater in the Philippines, weaving it with the tapestry of popular cultural texts&mdash;among which are religious texts, conduct books, popular films, romance novels, cookbooks, and greeting cards&mdash;that discourse on the problematiques of Filipino womanhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1, &ldquo;Kung Bakit Kailangang Hanapin at Pag-aralan si Ginang Cruz o ang Mandudulang Babae&rdquo; (Why It is Necessary to Search for and Study Mrs Cruz or the Woman Playwright-Dramatist), introduces Mrs Cruz, the playwright <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2862\">Juan Matapang Cruz</a>&rsquo;s wife who is speculated to be the real writer of the 1903 play <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/560\"><strong>Hindi Aco Patay</strong></a></em></strong> (I Am Not Dead), as the allegorical figure of the female dramatist excluded from Philippine theater history. As such exclusion is maintained by the vast influence wielded by Aristotelian poetics on theatrical practice and, on a larger scale, by patriarchy in the Philippines, Barrios asserts the imperative of constructing the poetics of women&rsquo;s theater in the Philippines. She then embarks on a discussion of <strong>talinghaga</strong> (metaphor) as the interpretive tool in analyzing social, political, and sexual discursive systems, which the women playwrights and their plays engage with, and interrogate. The chapter also features a survey of related researches on the field of feminist literature and Philippine theater, as well as the study&rsquo;s scope, limitation, and organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2, &ldquo;Paglalandas sa Daang Tinahak ng Kababaihang Mandudula&rdquo; (Traversing the Road Taken by Women Dramatists), chronicles the history of women&rsquo;s multifarious involvements in Philippine theater. The author recovers this silenced history by tracing the roles women have variously assumed in different forms of theater practice that developed across Philippine history&mdash;from the indigenous shamans known as the babaylan who lead community rituals, the <strong>binukot</strong> who serve as the chroniclers of epic narratives, to the female dramatists of the 20th century who have been involved in various aspects of theater production like writing, acting, directing, and producing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next three chapters employ the talinghaga of space, character, and form, respectively, in analyzing the plays in relation to specific sociohistorical conditions, cultural texts, and practices that are implicated in and with the discursive regimes surrounding Filipino womanhood. Each critical discussion opens with the author&rsquo;s reflections on her experiences as an actress, playwright, and director in various theatrical productions, like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/525\"><strong>Ang Bundok</strong></a></em></strong> (The Mountain) and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2975\">Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Laban ng Basketball</em></strong> (A Basketball Match).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3, &ldquo;Entablado, Espasyo, at Heograpiya bilang Talinghaga&rdquo; (Stage, Space, and Geography as Metaphor), foregrounds how the stage (re)presents metaphorical spaces that define and are defined by the discursive systems that frame the concept and experience of Filipino womanhood. Reading plays like Ritchie Valencia-Buenaventura&rsquo;s <strong><em>June Bride</em></strong>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2755\">Glecy Atienza</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Lutong Bahay</em></strong> (Home-Cooked Meal), and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3007\">Malou Jacob</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/504\"><strong><em>Anatomiya ng Korupsiyon</em></strong></a> (Anatomy of Corruption), the author demonstrates how the kitchen, the factory, the office, the forests, and the mountains (re)present spaces where women enact different responses to the oppressiveness of patriarchy&mdash;from the decision to escape the space of domestic confinement to the act of participating in larger sociopolitical struggles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 4, &ldquo;Ang Tauhan bilang Talinghaga, Ilang Tala ng Isang Artista&rdquo; (The Character as Metaphor, Some Notes of an Artist), the author undertakes a close reading of plays, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em><strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong> ni Eva/Ang Aking Ina</em></strong> (Daughter of Eva/My Mother), <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Lorena</em></strong>, and Barrios&rsquo;s own <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/536\"><strong><em>Damas de Noche</em></strong></a> (Women of the Night), to unravel the complex discourses on womanhood that are ushered in by female archetypes in theater. Her discussions on the metaphorical significance of the weeping mother as the Inangbayan (Motherland), the revolutionary woman, the silenced/silent woman in the family, the barren woman, the prostitute, and the phantom rape victim offer critical interventions on the problem and potential of female agency in the face of physical, linguistic, moral, and political violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5, titled &ldquo;Ang Anyo bilang Talinghaga, Ilang Tala ng Isang Mandudula&rdquo; (The Form as Metaphor, Some Notes of a Dramatist), presents critical discussions of plays, like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/580\"><strong><em>Kantada ng Babaing Mandirigma</em></strong></a> (Song of the Female Warrior) by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5122\">Merlinda Bobis</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5396\">Magdalena Jalandoni</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Anak nga Malalison</em></strong> (The Wayward Daughter), Saturnina Rodil&rsquo;s <strong><em>Datu Matu</em></strong>, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5697\">Luna Sicat</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Maternal</em></strong>, to foreground how form functions as metaphor. The author&rsquo;s investigation of the plays&rsquo; appropriation and subversion of generic conventions derived from other forms, like the epic narrative, the horror story, and the historical play, emphasizes that feminist theater must be transformative to enable the woman dramatist to transcend mere exposition of the issues surrounding womanhood in the Philippines and actualize the emancipatory possibilities embedded in the poetics and practice of the craft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book&rsquo;s significance primarily lies on the author&rsquo;s discovery and recovery of the metaphorical Mrs Cruz by foregrounding the absent presence of the female in Philippine theater. The project&rsquo;s imagination and articulation of the poetics of feminist theater present a significant revaluation of theater as an important discursive realm through and in which the complex struggles of womanhood in the Philippines are staged.

College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Framing theater as a cultural embodiment of the material structure of a community, the study traces the rise of the people&rsquo;s theater during the collapse of the sugar industry, which maintained the hacienda cultural hegemony. After outlining the study in chapter 1, Lucero discusses its theoretical framework in chapter 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3 contextualizes the Negros sugar industry in the colonial and neocolonial economic history of the Philippines. The hacienda culture ensures the position of the&nbsp;<em>amo&nbsp;</em>(plantation owner) as god, assuring him of the workers&rsquo; obedience and respect at all times. He makes sure that the plantation workers survive the lean months by, for instance, providing them a steady supply of rice called the&nbsp;<em>consumo</em>. But the collapse of the sugar industry forced the plantation owner to stop the consumo, thus removing himself from his position and forcing the plantation workers to provide for themselves. This economic disturbance resulted in the disturbance of the workers&rsquo; belief system itself. Thus, whatever was deemed right or just in the hacienda cultural system became untenable. The Catholic Church, through the Basic Christian Communities and the National Federation of Sugar Workers, provided alternative belief systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 4, Lucero traces the beginning of the people&rsquo;s theater in Negros to the founder of Katilingban sa Katubuhan (Community Theater in Sugarland), Luisa Reyes, who taught speech and drama at La Consolacion College in Bacolod City. Fr Alan Abadeco, a former member of Reyes&rsquo;s drama class, put up the Pagbutlak (Sunrise) theater group. When Bishop Antonio Fortich called for a more active diocesan youth movement, Abadesco organized Teatro Pangkatilingban (TP). TP succeeded in mobilizing the Negros youth within a year (1977-78), as attested by its 27 chapters, 591 members, and a total of 59 cultural productions. However, political and military repression pushed TP to later abolish most of its chapters. Teatro Obrero (TO) was then organized, involving the politicized youth of the organized hacienda. Within eight months, TO ballooned to 120 chapters with 3,000 members. Negros Theater League (NTL) was organized in 1983, with Joel R. Arbolario as chairman, at the end of a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association</a>-conducted workshop attended by 34 representatives of 16 theater groups all over Negros.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5 analyzes five plays. TP&rsquo;s <strong><em>Hacienda de Premiero: Mga Obrero nga Wala Nagahugpong Magadugang sa Kapiguson</em></strong> (Hacienda de Premiero: Workers Who Do Not Unite Intensify Oppresion), 1978, is a 15-minute dramatic sketch detailing the friction between owners and the amo over idle lands occupied and utilized by the workers. <strong><em>Ang Gutom sang Negros</em></strong> (Hunger in Negros), 1979, similar to a one-act play in length but not in structure, analyzes the societal causes of hunger. <strong><em>Gutom sang <strong>Banwa</strong></em></strong> (Hunger in the Country), 1982, is a revision of the former with a more national perspective. NTL&rsquo;s <strong><em>Sang Matapungawan si Lito Estudiante</em></strong> (When Lito Estudiante Went Mad), 1985, a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/481\"><strong>dula-tula</strong></a> (play-poem), chronicles the discovery of Lito, a boy from the barrio who goes to the city to study, that real learning comes not just from books but from the people&rsquo;s experiences. Lito eventually returns to the barrio and joins the armed struggle as solution to the poverty of the people. The chapter ends with an analysis of <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/679\"><strong>Tiempos Muertos</strong></a></em></strong> (The Dead Season), 1987, a docu-drama with an episodic structure that illustrates the different facets of the Negros workers&rsquo; life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 6, the final chapter, offers a theory of a people&rsquo;s theater, specifying its two tasks as (a) the unmasking of the means by which power is maintained in the society, and (b) the affirmation of an alternative culture. Lucero argues that the people&rsquo;s theater is always necessary as it sustains the people&rsquo;s struggle, with its continuing creation of symbolic forms articulating the solidarity of the working class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study includes scripts, transcriptions from tapes of theatrical productions, letters, statements, reports, resolutions and newsletters, and interviews with key persons. Among the appendices are letters, a brief description of the Makiisa-Negros Theater Festival, the list of theater group participants, the plays staged during the three-day festival, the titles and forms of the plays produced by NTL (1983-88), and the script of Arbolario&rsquo;s <strong><em>Tiempos Muertos</em></strong>. The study provides the only existing account of the rise of the Negros people&rsquo;s theater in Philippine literary history. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Pe&ntilde;afrancia Raniela E.

Retana begins his inquiry by seeking proofs of pre-Hispanic theater, and considering the two works that precede his: Vicente Barrantes&rsquo;s <strong><em>El&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Teatro Tagalo</em></strong>, 1889, and the series of 16 articles by Juan Atayde in <strong><em>La</em></strong> <em><strong>Ilustracion&nbsp;</strong><strong>Filipina</strong> </em>, 1892-93. The former uses arguments rather than documents, he concludes; the latter are enumerations of theater spectacles rather than historical investigations.

Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book gathers together 15 of Fernandez&rsquo;s essays written, read, or published between 1978 and 1995 on different &ldquo;forms and times&rdquo; of Philippine theater. The introductory essay,&ldquo;From&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/469\">Ritual</a>&nbsp;to <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/468\">Realism</a>,&rdquo; traces the development of Philippine drama from the songs and dances of the precolonial past, to the staged <strong>comedia</strong> and religious plays of the Spanish colonial period, tothe &ldquo;seditious plays,&rdquo; musicals, and prose plays in English and in the vernaculars of the American years, to the multitude of forms&mdash;epic theater,s ocial realism, and psychological realism&mdash;produced since World War II.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essays under the heading &ldquo;Stages of Development: Forms and Times,&rdquo; the bulk of the book, explain in greater detail the forms mentioned in the introduction. In &ldquo;Indigenous Drama,&rdquo; Fernandez legitimates the &ldquo;panoply of rituals, verbal play, songs and dances&rdquo;&mdash;disqualified as drama by Barrantes and Retana&mdash;as &ldquo;native forms of mimesis or mimetic action.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Jesuits and EarlyTheater&rdquo; presents the special role of the religious order in propagating staged drama during the Spanish colonial period. &ldquo;Tradition and Revitalization in the Komedya&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zarzuela to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><em>Sarswela</em></a>&rdquo; describe the two rival forms in all their quaintness and continuing relevance. Formal conventions (of staging, line delivery, writing) are explained in the light of the worldviews, or systems of values, that these forms uphold, such as the equation of manhood with heroism and the irresistible power of love. &ldquo;The &lsquo;Seditious&rsquo; Plays&rdquo; is an account of the works of <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a> and other playwrights deemed &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; by the American colonial government. The last four essays in this section assess contemporary drama. Fernandez explores the ingenuity of Filipino artists in hurdling boundaries of economy (by communal support, tradition) andof political repression (by allegory, indirection, use of historical and folk figures).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The section &ldquo;In Close Focus: Texts and Performances&rdquo; discuss a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\"><strong>salubong</strong></a> (meeting), a <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, and a modern realist play. Fernandez shows that the creative text is intertwined with contexts, whether personal, literary, or sociopolitical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two essays in &ldquo;Noteson Criticism&rdquo; pose questions affecting the study of Philippine drama and point out the paramount problem in Philippine criticism: personalism. Drawing on Rodin and Henry James, Fernandez defines the role of the criticas that of an intermediary between playwright and audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two appendices in the book are as valuable as the essays themselves. In the first, Fernandez lists events from 1598 to 1995 that bear on Philippine drama&mdash;the premieres of landmark productions, the construction of theaters, the publication of significant criticism, and political developments. The second is a list of some 250 plays, from <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/618\"><strong>A Modern Filipina</strong></a></em></strong> to <strong><em>An Maimbud na Aqui</em></strong> (The Gentle Child), from <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/551\"><strong><em>Gran Comedia de la Toma del Pueblo de Corralat y Conquista del Cerro</em></strong></a> (Grand Play on the Capture of the Town of Corralat and the Conquest of the Hill) to <strong><em>D.H.</em></strong> <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Jonathan Chua</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

The sarsuwela gathers its audience around the character of Captain Tinong, Tisay&rsquo;s father, who prefers Ardo, a wealthy friend&rsquo;s son, for his daughter. Tisay, however, prefers the poor but literate and wise Banong. Captain Tinong&rsquo;s character elicits laughter and condemnation for his uncontrollable gambling and poor judgment of people. Town elder Urbano helps Captain Tinong several times in the play and in the end reminds the audience of the ill effects of gambling. Celestino&rsquo;s <strong><em>Say Quieoya Angapoy Serom</em></strong>, more serious in tone, intersperses songs exchanged between characters, and emphasizes education, perseverance, loyalty, and parental responsibility. Ilagan&rsquo;s <strong><em>Dalagang Bukid</em></strong> ridicules authoritarian figures in society&mdash;adults, parents, and politicians. The abusive parents of the eponymous Angelita are both addicted gamblers and exploit their children by making them work to finance their vice. Angelita, however, bravely weds her beloved Cipriano against their wishes. Nuyda&rsquo;s <strong><em>Anti-Cristo</em></strong> is a satirical play that ends with the killing of a Spanish friar by Felixberta, a maiden who rejects the friar&rsquo;s sexual advances. Damaso&rsquo;s <strong><em>Nalaya cag Manalingsing</em></strong> also chronicles a young woman&rsquo;s defiance of her parents. Leonor maintains her love for Carlos despite her father&rsquo;s objection to his poverty and unknown parentage. In Rodriguez&rsquo;s <strong><em>Balaod sa Kinabuhi</em></strong>, Peping, the son of the rich, greedy, and unforgiving Se&ntilde;or Simon, stands not only against parental authority but also against the capital&rsquo;s exploitation of workers. He leaves all for Maring, a woman whose house has been foreclosed by his father, works as a laborer at a dock, and goes on strike with her fellow laborers against their employer. Though Peping dies, his father is moved to change his ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ramas&rsquo;s foreword and each of the introductions suggest that the anthology is a work propelled by nationalism, which rallied many Filipino scholars in the 1960s and the 1970s. Although the project was conceptualized in 1973, the work of the respective researchers started in the late 1960s. The notion of the nation here is already that which embraces the regions.

The anthology, as Tiongson puts it, &ldquo;sums up the results of the interaction workshops held during the festival, including those on mime, music, visual arts, southern ethnic dance, people&rsquo;s theater and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/446\">children&rsquo;s theater</a>, and then describes the gallery of people&rsquo;s art.&rdquo; More importantly, the book aims to inform national and international readers about the state of culture in the Philippines during the martial law era&mdash;in particular, on how culture was used by the Marcos regime as a tool of deception and control. To counter such culture, the works featured during the festival and anthologized in the book represent and espouse what Tiongson calls a &ldquo;new type of people&rsquo;s culture.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anthology is divided into five sections, with each section focusing on a specific artistic form(s). The first section consists of symposia lectures held during the festival. It is further divided into three subsections&mdash;namely, &ldquo;Literature and Mass Media,&rdquo; &ldquo;Visual Arts and Film,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Music and Theater.&rdquo; Some of the notable lectures included in this section are <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5743\">Rosario Torres-Yu</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The State of Philippine Literature,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3575\">Alice Guillermo</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The State of Visual Arts,&rdquo; and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5486\">Fe Mangahas</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;The State of Philippine Music.&rdquo; Reactors for these lectures included writers like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5048\">Teo Antonio</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5104\">Lualhati Bautista</a>, artists like <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/5/4113\">Jim Paredes</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/3/3511\">Felipe de Leon Jr</a>, and critics such as <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5335\">Teresita Maceda</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5504\">Sylvia Mayuga</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second section, &ldquo;Workshop and Matinee Shows,&rdquo; collects the poems, songs, and skits performed during the festival.

Scripts of skits included in this section are the Correspondents&rsquo; Association&rsquo;s <strong><em>Ang Mga Kagila-gilalas na Pakikipagsapalaran ni Juan Peryodista</em></strong> (The Amazing Adventures of Juan the Journalist), an adaptation of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5429\">Jose F.

Published 1994. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2728\">Ruby Gamboa Alcantara</a>. Manila: Rex Book Store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book focuses on the ritual <strong>sayaw-awit</strong> (dance-song) performed by devotees of San Pedro, San Pablo, and Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Rosa or Virgen de la Rosa held every 29th and 30th of June in Old Makati. The study is based on observation and documentation of actual performances of the sayaw-awit in the Plaza of Cristo Rey, located in front of the San Pedro&ndash;San Pablo Church in Barrio Poblacion, Makati, in 1985 and 1986, as well as interviews of eight dancers who performed in 1985, and a number of residents of Barrio Poblacion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1 defines the key concepts used in the study, such as mimesis, ritual, context, and theater, and presents the objectives of the study, review of related literature, and structure of the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 begins with a brief history of Makati&mdash;from the time of Captain Pedro de Brito&rsquo;s purchase of a big tract of land in 1589, up to the period when Makati became the country&rsquo;s center of commerce, trade, and finance. It distinguishes two sides of Makati: the area of Makati Avenue, where buildings of prominent corporations and banks are located, and Old Makati, also known as Barrio Poblacion, where traditional and religious rituals, feasts, celebrations, and ceremonies are still observed. Various rituals and celebrations are performed throughout the year in Old Makati, but the ritual of sayaw-awit is singled out as the most anticipated and spirited religious event. The chapter introduces the organizers of the <strong>panata</strong> (devotion), the Atilon family. Alcantara traces the roots of Emiliano V. Atilon, head organizer of the panata then and the oldest living member of the Atilon clan, to Lorenza Victor-Ventura, or Lelang Enzang. As Lelang Enzang was born in 1835 and was a dancer for the ritual when she was a young woman, Alcantara deduces the beginnings of the sayaw-awit as prior to 1835. Alcantara explains that the Atilons&rsquo; stewardship of the panata pertains to the safekeeping of the text, music, and dance movements used in the ritual, as well as the teaching and training of the participants. Several wealthy families in Barrio Poblacion and in nearby barrios provide financial support for various expenses, such as clothes for the dancers and the statues of the saints, food, stage construction, music, and props.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3 describes the structure and content of the panata, which comprises five parts: novena, <strong>misa</strong> (mass), <strong>prusisyon</strong> (procession), <strong>sayaw-awit sa plasa</strong> (dance-song in the plaza), and <strong>sayaw-awit sa bahay-bahay</strong> (house-to-house dance-song). The structure of the panata text is as follows: &ldquo;Dicho sa Mahal na Virgen&rdquo; (Homage to the Blessed Virgin), &ldquo;Dicho kay San Pedro at San Pablo&rdquo; (Homage to San Pedro and San Pablo), &ldquo;Trono&rdquo; (Throne), &ldquo;Awit sa Mahal na Virgen&rdquo; (Song for the Blessed Virgin), and &ldquo;Awit kay San Pedro at San Pablo&rdquo; (Song for San Pedro and San Pablo). Alcantara then describes in detail the costumes of the nine young female dancers, as well as their routine of 36 unique and nonrepeating steps. The singing part of the panata begins with the chanting of the first part, which leads to the singing of the verses with accompanying music. Various preparations for the performance of the sayaw-awit also take place, such as choosing the <strong>mananayaw</strong> (dancer), teaching the mananayaw the movements and songs, rehearsals, constructing the stage, borrowing statues of the three saints, preparing food for the dancers and musicians, and making the props.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4 expounds on the significance of the sayaw-awit, particularly to the community that nurtures it. The performance of the ritual of sayaw-awit has become a means of teaching and transmitting attitudes and values that are preserved and protected. It is also a way of extending and strengthening social bonds in the community. Upholding the practices and traditions in the performance of the sayaw-awit consolidates and enriches the community and society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last part of the book is the appendix, comprising the profile of the nine dancers who performed in 1985 and 1986, pictures of actual performances on different years, text of the panata, and notations of dance and music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is the first documentation of the ritual of sayaw-awit in Old Makati and proves that even in highly urbanized areas, such as Makati, Filipino cultural traditions endure. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Galileo S.

MA thesis. Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3312\">Sir Anril P. Tiatco</a>. College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sir Anril P. Tiatco&rsquo;s masteral thesis introspects on the meanings and valuations related to the popular ritual <strong>pagpapako sa krus</strong> (crucifixion) performed every Good Friday in Cutud, Pampanga. Using methodologies such as participant observation, <strong>pakikipagkuwentuhan</strong> (sharing of stories), and <strong>pakikisalamuha</strong> (community integration), a descriptive-historical study of the pagpapako sa krus was done.

Bernal</a>&rsquo;s work as designer for theater, with over 200 full-color photographs of his sketches, models, and actual costumes and sets complementing the text.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 1, Tiongson provides a biographical sketch of Bernal, focusing on his education as an artist. Bernal&rsquo;s apprenticeship began in his mother&rsquo;s dress shop, where he learned techniques of &ldquo;cutting, sewing, and embroidery.&rdquo; Later, when he was studying at Ateneo de Manila University, Bernal developed an interest in writing poetry. <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3314\">Rolando Tinio</a>, his mentor, also introduced him to theater. Afterward, Bernal received formal training in the theater arts at Northwestern University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design process is the subject of chapter 2. As a designer, Bernal shied away from literalist renderings and preferred abstractions or stylization. Tiongson credits this orientation both to his teachers and to his appreciation for modern poetry. In example after example, Tiongson shows that Bernal&rsquo;s sets and costumes are visual incarnations of the text, indices of character or feeling, not mere decorations or concessions to realism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapters 3 and 4, Tiongson gives a further account of Bernal&rsquo;s creative process and of his ingenuity in the face of limitations. Tiongson writes that Bernal turns to various sources for his design concepts, sometimes combining them to &ldquo;stunning results.&rdquo; To turn his design concepts into reality, Bernal has had to overcome such realities as less than adequate budgets, poor technology, or limiting acting or dancing spaces. Bernal finds solutions in the unlikeliest places. Evidence of Bernal&rsquo;s creativity is his ability to transform inexpensive materials into impressive stage effects. The &ldquo;crystal chandelier&rdquo; in a production of <strong><em>La Traviata</em></strong>, Tiongson reveals, was merely an assemblage of plastic cases of ballpoint pens; the dreamy &ldquo;enchanted forest&rdquo; of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/6/2406\">Ballet Philippines</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/49/110\"><strong><em>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</em></strong></a> was cheap &ldquo;gauze&nbsp;<em>katsa&nbsp;</em>[unbleached muslin], sprayed with blue, green, andhoney-yellowdyes&rdquo;; and the native costumes of many a production were made of&nbsp;<em>sinamay&nbsp;</em>(abaca cloth), which under the right lights appear like the genuine article.

College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thesis attempts to describe and analyze the theater activities during Iligan&rsquo;s San Miguel fiesta, to show how the &ldquo;external forms of the said activities manifest [Iligan&rsquo;s] cultural values&rdquo; and &ldquo;fulfill important defensive and integrative functions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thesis is divided into four chapters. Chapter 1, the introduction, provides readers the study&rsquo;s overview, basic assumptions, and a general background of Iligan City. Here, Fernandez establishes his basic arguments and provides the definition of key concepts, such as ritual, form, and traditional art. Chapter 2, &ldquo;The Iligan City Fiesta of Se&ntilde;or San Miguel,&rdquo; centers on the San Miguel fiesta and the folk narratives about the life of San Miguel. The chapter is divided into three subsections, each focusing on a particular historical and practical aspect of the San Miguel fiesta&mdash;namely, &ldquo;Se&ntilde;or San Miguel: The Folk Hero,&rdquo; &ldquo;The San Miguel <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1551\">Folk Narratives</a>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Events, Practices, and Other Beliefs.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3, &ldquo;The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/3/82/2283\">Rituals</a> and Folk Arts,&rdquo; the core of the work, describes and analyzes the ritual artistic forms that Fernandez says reveal much about the Iliganon culture: the <strong>pagkanaug</strong>, the <strong>sinulog</strong>, the <strong>diandi</strong>, and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/449\"><strong>drama</strong></a> of San Miguel. Fernandez describes and comments on the &ldquo;visual manifestation, material expression, dance and movements, music and song, chants, the texts of dialogues and the verses, and the overall formats during their performances.&rdquo; In chapter 4, &ldquo;Value Implications: Correlations to Forms and Function,&rdquo; the author attempts to evaluate and discuss the correlations of form, function, and values of the ritual activities during the fiesta.

Chapter 2, &#x201C;The Iligan City Fiesta of Se&#xF1;or San Miguel,&#x201D; centers on the San Miguel fiesta and the folk narratives about the life of San Miguel.

Fernandez describes and comments on the &#x201C;visual manifestation, material expression, dance and movements, music and song, chants, the texts of dialogues and the verses, and the overall formats during their performances.&#x201D; In chapter 4, &#x201C;Value Implications: Correlations to Forms and Function,&#x201D; the author attempts to evaluate and discuss the correlations of form, function, and values of the ritual activities during the fiesta.

Manila: Zarzuela Foundation of the Philippines Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book serves both as a historical analysis of the &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; plays and playwrights during the early stages of the American occupation and an introduction to the popular and allied dramatic forms of Philippine theater. Drawing from books, news articles, reports from the Philippine Commission, military records, travel accounts, and memoirs published during the American period, Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s work problematizes the term &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; ascribed to the plays of playwrights like <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3318\">Aurelio Tolentino</a>, Manuel Xeres-Burgos, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2711\">Juan Abad</a>, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3202\">Tomas Remigio</a>, and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3210\">Severino Reyes</a>, which are characterized by anticolonial and nationalist sentiments, while attempting to map and trace the development of &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; plays from what Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio calls an &ldquo;admixture of political, religious, and literary hues.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book has four chapters. Chapter 1, titled &ldquo;Historical Background,&rdquo; gives readers an overview of the popular and allied dramatic forms of Philippine theater and argues that the seditious plays sprang from earlier dramatic forms that date back to the early years of Spanish conquest. Each of the chapter&rsquo;s five subsections discusses a particular dramatic form which she claims contributed to the emergence of the &ldquo;seditionary drama.&rdquo; The forms constitute the titles of the section, thus: &ldquo;The <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/464\">Panuluyan</a> and the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/470\">Salubong</a>,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Pasion and the Cenaculo,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Moro-moro,&rdquo; &ldquo;The <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/445\">Carillo</a>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Debates: Karagatan, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\">Duplo</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/441\">Balagtasan</a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2, &ldquo;Zarzuela,&rdquo; discusses the development of the native <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>, the dramatic form that, Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio asserts, had the biggest influence on and was eventually utilized by playwrights like Aurelio Tolentino, Severino Reyes, Tomas Remigio, and Juan Abad. The author claims that historical events at the time the sarsuwela dominated the country&rsquo;s theater scene paved the way for the radicalization of its content and elements. She cites two major periods: the decade that preceded the Battle of Manila Bay in 1898, which was characterized by native unrest and intense revolutionary fervor against the Spanish colonial rule, and the aftermath of the Battle of Manila Bay, a short period in which the American forces, led by Commodore Dewey, started consolidating their forces for the occupation of Manila. Chapter 2 has seven subsections. Four of these elaborate on the seditious traits incorporated by Tolentino and his contemporaries into the sarsuwela under the section headings &ldquo;The Theatre as Sedition Breeder,&rdquo; &ldquo;Uses of Speeches and Eulogies,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Chameleon Plays,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Use of Theatrical Machinery and Effects.&rdquo; The last subsection discusses the fate suffered by the &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; playwrights at the hands of the Spanish and American colonial regimes and reflects on the role of theater, and of literature as a whole, in the project of national liberation and nation building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3, &ldquo;Additional Notes,&rdquo; features Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s observations, comments, and recommendations on the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2373\">Tagalog</a> sarsuwela. Here, she mainly identifies problems faced by the sarsuwela as a distinct literary and dramatic form born under and influenced by specific historical conditions. She provides possible routes of inquiry from which new studies can emerge and materialize. Finally, she posits several recommendations toward the preservation of the Tagalog sarsuwela in the face of what she dubs the &ldquo;frenzied Anglo-Saxonizing&rdquo; of Philippine culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4, &ldquo;Appendix of Plays,&rdquo; anthologizes the texts of four typical &ldquo;seditious plays.&rdquo; Manuel Xeres-Burgos&rsquo;s <strong><em>Con la Cruz y la Espada</em></strong> (With the Cross and the Sword), ca. 1901, here in English translation, tackles the atrocities of Spanish colonization.

Author, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2840\">Apolonio Bayani Chua</a>. Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book is based on the author&rsquo;s dissertation submitted to the Philippine Studies Program of the College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman, in 1996. In seven chapters, it discusses the history, context, organization, and productions of cultural groups that are attached to workers&rsquo; trade unions in Metropolitan Manila. It highlights the <strong>dulambayan</strong>, one of several terms used by these groups to refer to their cultural productions, examining their audience, venue, actor, text, and context. Among these elements, Chua asserts that it is the context&mdash;the militant unionism, meaning &ldquo;tunay, palaban, at makabayan&rdquo; (legitimate, militant, and nationalist)&mdash;which defines and distinguishes the dulambayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 1 discusses the background of the study, the objectives, survey of related literature, theoretical framework and its application, and the structure of the book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 focuses on the history of Tanghalang Silangan, a cultural group based in the Bisig-Pagkakaisa&ndash;National Federation of Labor Unions of Rubberworld Philippines Incorporated. Established in 1980, the group had the most extensive tradition of songs, plays, and visual arts of all cultural groups based in the trade unions in Metropolitan Manila in the period covered by the study. Both Tanghalang Silangan and Bisig-Pagkakaisa have become models for other groups and unions. By focusing on Tanghalang Silangan, the study shows the relationship between the cultural group and the militant workers&rsquo; union, and the dynamics of cultural production of the foremost workers&rsquo; cultural group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3 traces the path of Allison Opaon, who has the longest and most productive experience both as a musician and as a songwriter among the members of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3299\">Teatro Pabrika</a>, a network of workers&rsquo; cultural groups. A strong influence of unionism pervades Opaon&rsquo;s journey as a laborer and a cultural worker, through the contexts of his musical productions. In the creative process, unionism inspires &ldquo;katwiran, kabuuan, at katangian&rdquo; (rationale, unity, and character) in the dulambayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4 details the formation and development of Teatro Pabrika. The group started from disparate initiatives in Novaliches, Quezon City, and Valenzuela; progressed into the formation of the Quezon City Trade Unions Cultural Group, a merging of four local groups; and united as a network of 35 workers&rsquo; cultural groups and committees. Also mentioned in the chapter are several cultural initiatives from the middle class and the academic community that have connections with workers&rsquo; issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 5, Chua highlights three forms of dulambayan&mdash; <strong>haranang bayan</strong> (people&rsquo;s serenade), <strong>akyat-bus</strong> (bus action), and <strong>pag-iingay</strong> (making noise)&mdash;shaped by the distinct culture of strikes and picket lines organized by militant unionism, representing the workers&rsquo; response to their oppression. The dulambayan is determined not only by unionism but also by the <strong>tradisyong bayan</strong> (people&rsquo;s tradition) derived from the culture brought by the workers who fled to Manila from the various regions of the Philippines. Chua explains that the workers reprocessed the tradisyong bayan to adjust to the prevailing conditions of their struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 6, Chua elaborates on the major aspects of the dulambayan, such as the audience, venue, actor, text, and context, as well as the forms and processes of the workers&rsquo; cultural productions. Chua uses specific dulambayan&mdash;from Jojo Atilano&rsquo;s production of <strong><em>Katulad ni Itay</em></strong> (Like Father), 1981, an original play by the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>, to Teatro Pabrika&rsquo;s Pista ng Dulambayan ng Manggagawa, which featured around 15 productions and numerous songs from 1992 to 1993, and several other productions in between&mdash;as bases of discussion of the various aspects and characteristics of the dulambayan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In chapter 7, the author reiterates the main ideas developed about the history and nature of the workers&rsquo; dulambayan. Chua adopts Prospero Covar&rsquo;s outline of theater tradition in the Philippines and positions the workers&rsquo; dulambayan alongside the theater tradition of farmers and the&nbsp;<em>kilusang pangkalayaan&nbsp;</em>(revolutionary movements). Finally, the author maps out these theater traditions based on the triangular structure of Philippine society, with the &ldquo;theater&rdquo; tradition constituting the upper segment, and the dulambayan of workers, farmers, and other minority groups comprising the base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interspersed in different chapters of the book are texts and notes relevant to the workers&rsquo; dulambayan: the songs of Tanghalang Silangan; songs by Allison Opaon and a narrative of his experience in Mindanao; scripts of <strong><em>Kabuhayang Tagpi-Tagpi</em></strong> (Patchwork Life) and <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/542\"><strong>Eksena ng Kulungan</strong></a></em></strong> (Scene from Prison); a list of selected workers&rsquo; cultural groups; an excerpt from the journal of the Quezon City Trade Unions Cultural Groups; and a chronology of events related to the formation of the workers&rsquo; dulambayan, 1972-2005.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chua&rsquo;s position as a scholar, participant observer, and artist-teacher of PETA, which served the community and sectoral-based cultural groups, allowed him to view the meaning and significance of dulambayan from the perspective of the workers themselves.

It highlights the <strong>dulambayan</strong>, one of several terms used by these groups to refer to their cultural productions, examining their audience, venue, actor, text, and context. Among these elements, Chua asserts that it is the context&#x2014;the militant unionism, meaning &#x201C;tunay, palaban, at makabayan&#x201D; (legitimate, militant, and nationalist)&#x2014;which defines and distinguishes the dulambayan."

Quezon City: University of the Philippines Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third of the originally planned five-volume anthology on Philippine theater history, the book focuses on the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a>, the Lenten play on the life and sufferrings of Jesus Christ, first performed in the 18th century. The book features two essays by Tiongson on the definition and history of sinakulo and on the <strong>tanggal</strong>, Bicol&rsquo;s version of the sinakulo. To further illustrate the form, the anthology documents a performance of the tanggal from Tambo, Buhi, Camarines Sur. An English translation of the tanggal performance text by Teresita Erestain and photographs of the performance are also provided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiongson&rsquo;s introductory essay on the sinakulo is divided into four subsections. The first subsection, &ldquo;History,&rdquo; provides a brief history of the form from its beginnings during the middle part of the 18th century up to the 1970s when, as Tiongson observes, &ldquo;a new type of sinakulo has been evolved by socially conscious groups.&rdquo; The second subsection, &ldquo;The Traditional Sinakulo,&rdquo; discusses the variety of sinakulo that flourished in various provinces in the country&mdash;Rizal, Bulacan, Laguna, Pampanga, Bataan, and Camarines Sur. Here, Tiongson uses the sinakulo documented in Malolos, Bulacan, to illustrate the genre, arguing that most traditional sinakulo scripts from Malolos were &ldquo;carbon copies of each other&rdquo; because the farmers who composed them &ldquo;dare not depart from established beliefs for fear of heresy or hell.&rdquo; The third subsection, &ldquo;From Traditional to Modern,&rdquo; details the historical factors, such as pop culture and rural modernization, that served as catalysts for the emergence of the modern sinakulo. The final subsection, &ldquo;Conflict and Continuity,&rdquo; focuses on the diametrically opposed worldviews espoused by the traditional sinakulo and the modern sinakulo. Tiongson posits that while &ldquo;the traditional sinakulo endorses passivity in the face of aggressors, the modern sinakulo proposes action ranging from all-out rebellion to dismantle the whole structure of injustice to symbolic and quiet Pieta where the dead Christ is cradled by a united front of peasants, workers, students, and ethnic minorities.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The essay on the tanggal of Buhi provides a brief definition and history of the tanggal, its script, and its order of performance. The tanggal performance text presented and annotated in the book is gathered from multiple sources, such as <strong><em>Casaysayan can Mahal na Pasion ni Jesucristo Cagurangnanta, na Sucat Ipaglaad nin Puso nin Siisay man na Magbasa</em></strong> (The Story of the Holy Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ That Should Inflame the Heart of the Reader), loose sheets, and cassette tapes containing recorded tanggal performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tanggal text featured in the anthology is the one used by the Eclarinal group, which is based on the pasyon <strong><em>Casaysayan can Mahal na Pasion ni Jesucristo Cagurangnanta</em></strong>, Tranquilino Hernandez&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2334\">Bikol</a> translation of the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong><em><strong><strong>Pasyon</strong></strong>g</em></strong> </a><em><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/78/1927\"><strong><strong>Genesis</strong></strong></a> </em>(Passion of the Genesis). Unlike its source text, the tanggal text does not narrate the life of Christ in full. In fact, there are instances wherein the <strong>tanggalista</strong> would add related scenes or expand particular episodes, examples being the rant of the tree, the grass, and the soil when Adam and Eve begin to work in the field with their bolo and hoe; the story of Mary and Joseph&rsquo;s search for an inn in Bethlehem; and the story of how the corn originated from Eve&rsquo;s hair. Examples of episodes that have been supplemented with extra dialogue include the condemnation of the snake that tempted Eve; the annunciation to Mary; John, Mary Magdelene, and Martha&rsquo;s lament over the Virgin Mary&rsquo;s body; the entry into Jerusalem; and the farewell scenes between Jesus and Mary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire tanggal script is rendered in <strong>quintillas</strong>, or five-line octosyllabic verses with assonantal rhyme. Most of the verses are chanted in chorus or through dialogue by specific characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The location of the scenes varies depending on where the actors are situated. The majority of the scenes, however, take place on an elevated stage, most of the time located at the town plaza. Lighting is used for scenes performed during the night, with two fluorescent lamps to illuminate the altar. In the event of a power failure, coleman lamps and candles are brought in and placed squarely in different parts of the stage. To reach everyone in the entire barrio, a broadcast system is installed during the chanting of the tanggal, comprising microphones placed on a table or strung to elevated bamboo poles. Stage props are usually owned and brought by the group. According to Tiongson, these props are &ldquo;used for various purposes and assume different meanings.&rdquo; However, Tiongson adds, most props &ldquo;function practically, but not historically or artistically.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A pioneering work on the history of the sinakulo, the book is indispensable material for the breadth of its documentation, sources, and scholarship. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><strong><em>Written by Amado Anthony G.

He observes a dearth of critical works on theater among scholars of language. To address this, the book encourages the reader to identify the myriad <strong>uri</strong> (type), <strong>tabas</strong> (form), and <strong>layon</strong> (purpose) of the <strong>dula</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He laments, in the &ldquo;Pauna,&rdquo; an utter lack of recognition, appreciation, and study of the dulaan. Here, an allusion to Rizal&rsquo;s novel informs his&nbsp;<em>panaghoy</em>(plea) to the youth, the hope of theater, crying &ldquo;Magmamandudula kayo!&rdquo; (Arise, Playwrights!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book&rsquo;s main chapter delves, first, on a formalist discourse on the <strong>sining</strong> (art) and <strong>agham</strong> (technique) of the one-act play; second, a practicum on the one-act; and third, an advisory for <strong>mandudula</strong> (playwright) neophytes. In the first part, the author delimits his study&rsquo;s coverage to a short period of dulaang Tagalog&rsquo;s historical development. Foremost among the uri in the art of dula are the <strong>maaagting</strong> (tension-filled), <strong>masaya</strong> (joyous), and <strong>malungkot</strong> (sad), with or without music. Emphasis on the dula technique lies in playwright training or production preparation. Included are theme selection, outlining, characterization, and theme metamorphosis into three great requisites: <strong>paglalahad</strong> (exposition), <strong>buhol</strong>/<strong>kagusutan</strong> (conflict), and <strong>kalutasan</strong>/<strong>kakalasan</strong> (resolution). Dialogue is <strong>tahas</strong> (straightforward), <strong>talampak</strong> (frank), and <strong>tiyak</strong>/<strong>maliwanag</strong> (precise). Variety is offered in 11 forms from <strong>entremes</strong> to <strong>aproposito</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Balmaseda painstakingly outlines in the second part a module that engages budding mandudula to participate&mdash;for example, suggest a title to a patriotic allegory-in-the-works involving symbolic characters <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/576\">Kabesang Tales</a>, Aling Teresa, and Plaridel when news broke on the Pearl Harbor bombing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the third part, he exhorts aspiring mandudula to a scholarly life of reading dula, watching dulaan, listening to radio plays, and critiquing plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For genre study, the last chapter offers his works: <strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/665\"><strong>Sino Ba Kayo?</strong></a></em></strong> (Who Are You All?), a comedy of errors; <strong><em>Dahil sa <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong></em></strong> (Because of the Child), a drama on erroneous values; <strong><em>Ang Palabas ni Suwan</em></strong> (Juan&rsquo;s Show), a parody of power relations; <strong><em>Higanti ng&nbsp;</em><em>Patay</em></strong> (Revenge of the Dead), a horror tragedy with two mini-acts; <strong><em>Ang Libingan ng <strong>Bayani</strong></em></strong> (The Hero&rsquo;s Grave), an Ibsenian adaptation on Moro heroism with a mini-prologue; and <strong><em>Gregorio H. del Pilar</em></strong>, a historical play with three mini-acts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Taladulaan,&rdquo; a golden harvest of 113 oeuvre of 22 mandudula topped by prolific <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3082\">Patricio Mariano</a>, Julian Cruz Balmaseda, and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5642\">Pedrito Reyes</a>, is an homage to the&nbsp;<em>lihim&nbsp;</em>(secrets) of dulaan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though <strong><em>Sining at Agham</em></strong> initially reads like a manual, it is a testimony and ode to dulaan, informed by the undaunted, heroic, and continuing Filipinization movement represented in its constructs, codification, and critique of <strong>iisahing-yugto</strong>. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Melecio Cervantes Fabros III</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Emphasis on the dula technique lies in playwright training or production preparation. Included are theme selection, outlining, characterization, and theme metamorphosis into three great requisites: <strong>paglalahad</strong> (exposition), <strong>buhol</strong>/<strong>kagusutan</strong> (conflict), and <strong>kalutasan</strong>/<strong>kakalasan</strong> (resolution).

Chapter 2 covers early dramatic forms, such as the <strong>anito</strong> and the <strong>dallot</strong>, up to the religious forms during the Spanish colonial period, protest plays immediately after the Revolution, English plays, plays during the Japanese occupation, and the dramas of the 1950s.

The comedia in Bikol was first a community effort staged in Spanish, but a petition in the 1880s to enact the form in the Bikol language succeeded.

Short dramas, such as Bonifacio Baesa&rsquo;s <strong><em>An Governadorcillo</em></strong> (The Mayor), underscored an emerging sense of independence, specifying Sorsogon as the &ldquo;more vocal&rdquo; among the provinces.

Manila: De La Salle University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Based on the author&rsquo;s masteral thesis, &ldquo;A Prospectus for the National Theater of the Philippines,&rdquo; completed in 1967, this book is Guidote-Alvarez&rsquo;s blueprint for the development of drama and theater in the Philippines in three parts: (1) &ldquo;Historical Background of the Philippine Cultural Scene, Circa 1967,&rdquo; (2) &ldquo;Vision of a National Theater,&rdquo; and (3) &ldquo;Theater Architectural Guide for the Central Institute of Theater Arts in the Philippines (CITAP).&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In part 1, chapter 1 presents a broad assessment of the cultural scene in the Philippines in the early 1960s. The author singles out the contributions of popular, community, school and amateur theater groups in the country, concluding that Filipino theater was only regarded as a frivolity or a profit-oriented form of entertainment&mdash;a &ldquo;national failure to develop a theater tradition&rdquo;&mdash;and suggests the need for a national theater movement as a base for theater schools and professional repertory theaters in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 2 highlights the importance of theater as a medium of cultural reform. Citing various examples in world drama, the author stresses the values of theater as an expression of the soul, a source of moral values and educational benefits, a historical asset, an impetus to other artistic activities, and a means to fulfill human needs and preserve human rights&mdash;a distinguished profession where excellence and productivity are pursued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2, in five chapters, details the vision for the establishment of a national theater. Chapter 3 enumerates the important characteristics of a national theater: presence of support and artistic policy, service to a vast majority of citizens, availability of necessary venues and facilities, and an uncompromising dedication to quality. The National Theater of the Philippines must be present across the country in different local organizations, devoted to the creation of a dramaturgy reflective of Filipino culture, production of the best of world and contemporary drama, and the development of excellent theater artists. To achieve these, the author proposes the creation of a professional repertory theater program, a service and information program, a coordinating program for group development, and a multifaceted training program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4 problematizes the lack of well-trained personnel and artists for professional theater, of a more responsive audience, of more suitable playhouses, and native playwriting. It stresses the importance of education, creation, and growth of professional theaters nationwide. These new creations must emerge throughout the land as a chain of resident theater companies inspired by international drama companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5 identifies government and educational institutions as instrumental to the growth of Philippine theater, with schools as the main venue for theater education, and with government support for the creation of arts councils, inclusion of theater in the curriculum, a copyright law to protect artists&rsquo; rights, protection against financial hardships and illness, pensions to senior and aged artists, tours abroad, and honorific awards to deserving theater artists. At the same time, theater must be afforded freedom of creation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 6 proposes the legislation of a National Theater Trust Fund to support the establishment of (1) a Diverse Professional Theater Program, to include production of world classics and contemporary drama, native theater, youth theater, workers&rsquo; and peasants&rsquo; theater, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/466\">puppet theater</a>, experimental theater, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/460\">musical theater</a>, mime and improvisational theater, touring theater, and theater for film, radio, and television; (2) a Service and Information Program, to include theater library collection, script information, theater information service/research and publications program, theater organization advisory service, job counseling and placement service, film/record/photographic loan service, guest artist program, playwrights&rsquo; program, and a Philippine center of the International Theater Institute (ITI); (3) a Coordinating and Unifying Program, which can organize conventions, festivals, awards systems, drama federations like the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3169\">Philippine Educational Theater Association (PETA)</a>, an alliance of theater amateurs, a national association of theater artists, and a nationwide network of regional chapters; and (4) a Training Program, which will develop specialized training in educational and repertory theater, as well as short-term courses. For the author, the most effective channel to implement the mission of a national theater would be the creation of the CITAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 7 lays down the plan for the establishment of CITAP, which would be the base and headquarters, communications center, and seat of operations of all the major programs described in the thesis. It includes an organizational chart and a special chart on the Dramatic Arts Center, home to three main programs: Educational Theater, Broadcast Film Art Division, and the National Repertory Theater Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 3 begins with chapter 8, which describes the then current state of theater architecture in the Philippines, deploring design and construction inadequacies while commending excellent models outside the Philippines, based on distinctive philosophies and design innovations in terms of audience communication and creative staging possibilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 9 provides a brief survey of theater architectural forms from which planners can derive ideas. Guidote-Alvarez reiterates designer Roger Steven&rsquo;s main elements in theater design: communication as a factor of life and society, dramatic communication as a factor of the form of the play, and relationship of form to theater art. She finally recommends the use of the variable stage as the design foundation for CITAP&rsquo;s Dramatic Arts Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 10 enumerates specific guidelines for the design for a national theater, explaining the importance of the chosen site, functional spaces reflecting different programs, facilities, audience spaces, considerations of tri-dimensionality (time, space, man), multiplicity of staging areas, and sound and light enrichments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ideas brought forth by the thesis inspired the birth of PETA&rsquo;s programs and services. More importantly, the document successfully synthesized multiple contradictory forces at work during the specific historical juncture of the second half of the 20th century for Philippine theater, drawing strength from both global and Philippine indigenous traditions, as well as radical and elite movements, under the rubric of national theater. The book won the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5489\">Manila Critics Circle</a> National Book Award for literary criticism in 2003. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3032\">Lutgardo L.

		"text": "<p>Published 1994. Author, Cristina Laconico-Buenaventura. Manila: De La Salle University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book presents the theater structures in the Philippines from 1846 to 1946 and provides a narrative of the theater performances and events that took place in these structures at various periods in Philippine history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book has two main parts: Part 1, &ldquo;The Theaters of Manila: 1846-1896,&rdquo; on theaters of the Spanish period; and Part 2, &ldquo;The Theaters of Manila: 1896-1946,&rdquo; on theaters during the American regime. Laconico-Buenaventura&rsquo;s narrative begins in 1846, this being the year the first formal theater in the archipelago, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3293\">Teatro de Binondo</a>, was constructed. It ends with the inauguration of the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/8/341\">Metropolitan Theater</a> in 1931, which was heavily damaged during the Battle of Manila in 1945, and inaugurated once again in 1978 after restoration efforts done by then First Lady Imelda Romualdez-Marcos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 1, chapter 1, focuses on the formal theater structures of the Spanish period, presenting <strong>Teatro Espa&ntilde;ol</strong>, Spanish and/or European productions such as Italian opera, symphonies, and concerts for the Spanish elite and the upper classes; <strong>Teatro Tagalo</strong>, mainly <strong>moro-moro</strong> or <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a> written by Filipinos for a Filipino audience; <strong>comedia chinica</strong> or Chinese opera; and bullfights. Chapter 2 pertains to theater societies for the aficionados as well as theater and musical groups of the period. Visiting troupes influenced local actors and raised their level of professionalism and sophistication. Laconico-Buenaventura notes that Filipino playwrights wrote, aside from romantic dramas, plays to commemorate events. Chapter 3 discusses government involvement through regulations and proclamations ensuring public safety, monitoring of the types of shows presented, and supervision of personnel and audience decorum. Chapter 4 reviews theater in Manila during the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2, section 1, is titled &ldquo;The Early Decades of the American Occupation.&rdquo; Chapter 1 of this section continues with accounts on the theater activities. Teatro Tagalo provided popular entertainment and featured nationalist or &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; theater plays. Teatro Espa&ntilde;ol continued presenting Spanish plays, <strong>zarzuela</strong>, and musical comedies while welcoming, on occasion, the English drama and musical plays of foreign companies. A number of Manila&rsquo;s theaters also offered short films and live shows. Chapter 2 discusses the operations of the theaters as well as the shows and events at <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3303\">Teatro Zorrilla</a>, the <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3076\">Manila Grand Opera House</a>, various school auditoriums, and other theaters. Chapter 3 discusses the stage artists of Teatro Tagalo, among them <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2818\">Maria Carpena</a> and <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/2885\">Atang de la Rama</a>, as well as social groups dedicated to theater, professional theater companies, and theater publications. Chapter 4 follows the decline of Teatro Tagalo and Teatro Espa&ntilde;ol. Though the growing popularity of cinema and legitimate English language theater played their roles in the decline, so did some theater aspects and practices at this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2, section 2, is titled &ldquo;The Metropolitan Theater.&rdquo; Chapter 1 records how Mayor Tomas Earnshaw initiated the development of the theater: the city donated the land and the people, through a private corporation headed by Horace Pond, raised funds to build it. Architect <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/2/2/2633\">Juan Arellano</a> was chosen to design the building. It was envisioned to be a venue for concerts, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/5/35/786\">opera</a>s, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/6/46/37\">ballet</a>, and stage plays, as well as vaudeville, musical comedies, and revues, but it was also to be used for motion picture projections in between.

Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hundred years in the history of a barrio are studied in this critical work to show how a theater form embodies the moral order of the village of Valladolid.

The first traces the history of the village of Valladolid from the early 16th century when it was an important settlement, to its demotion as a barrio of Carcar in the 19th century, to its rise and decline in the early 20th century, and to its less than progressive present. This historical narration highlights, among others, the way the villagers came together or apart as they adjusted to their changing economic and social conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part focuses on the linambay tradition of Valladolid. It discusses the themes and plots of the komedya, which revolves around the love and war between Christians and Moors in Europe in the Middle Ages, and describes in detail the people involved in production behind and in front of the stage (especially the Gantuangcos and Regises), the stages of production, the kind of audience that watched the plays, and the circumstances surrounding the linambay performances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third part presents the social and economic conditions in Valladolid and their relationship to the linambay. From 1900 to 1925 the linambay flourished, supported by the material and social conditions of the village. From 1925 to 1940, the play declined and eventually disintegrated with the erosion of the very same material and social conditions on which it had depended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study paints a lucid picture of barrio life, of structures and linkages in society reflected in its theater. The play about kings and queens, Christians and infidels, monsters and clowns presented a world of fantasy, but one that the barrio folk recognized and in which they were symbolic participants. The hierarchical, feudal society on stage reflected the existing power relations in society and its elite vision of the world. And yet the linambay was a true tradition, a truly popular form of theater, which shows that the barrio peasantry accepted the elite vision of the linambay as their own. In it there was a symbolic representation of peasant society, thus a convergence of elite and non-elite interests, an &ldquo;overlapping of moral universes,&rdquo; an integration. All this Mojares shows through the external and internal changes in both barrio and play, using as viewing lenses the methods of literary criticism, cultural anthropology, and history. As the book unfolds, the reader grows in insight, understanding how theater is embedded in society, and society in theater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This unique and interdisciplinary study, a model for similar explorations, triumphs over the lack of predecessors and the thinness of historical record. Through research and interviews, and by literally walking the village, Resil Mojares enters into its universe, revealing to us its unique integration, its particular wholeness, its identity.

College of Arts and Letters, University of the Philippines Diliman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gloria T. Gamo&rsquo;s five-chapter thesis focuses on the <strong>luwa</strong>, a long poem declaimed on stage in praise of patron saints San Martin and the Birhen ng Caysasay held in Taal, Batangas. &ldquo;Luwa&rdquo; is the local term for <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/457\"><strong>loa</strong></a>, from the Spanish&nbsp;<em>loar</em>, &ldquo;to praise.&rdquo; The loa was an old Spanish form revering the patron saints in whose honor the <strong>comedia</strong> was performed.

The two most prominent writers of the luwa are Anselmo E. Garduce and Jose A. Badillo. The study examines 50 sample luwa texts written by the two using the conventions of traditional <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/73/1559\">poetry</a>, such as <strong>tugma</strong> (rhyme), <strong>taludtod</strong> (poetic lines), <strong>saknungan</strong> (poetic stanza), and <strong>talinghaga</strong> (metaphor) as frames of analysis. Although both sets of text contain elements of <strong>papuri</strong> (praise) and <strong>pasasalamat</strong> (gratitude), <strong>panalangin</strong> (prayer), and <strong>kahilingan</strong> (request), social issues feature more in the works of Garduce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 3 focuses on the <strong>luwante</strong>, or presenters of luwa. Data were gathered from interviews and surveys of 62 luwante, who explained the process from committing to present the form to staging actual performances of the luwa, their reasons for participation, their views on the relevance of the tradition, and their observations on changing trends in the practice of the luwa in Taal. Gamo emphasizes that the luwante communicates not only his or her personal intentions to the santo but also the collective aspirations of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 4 covers the performance of the luwa, centering on San Martin and the Birhen ng Caysasay. The study chronicles the oral histories and the miracles attributed to these saints based on the testimonies of informants from Taal. The narratives form the basis of the people&rsquo;s devotion and reasons for commemorating their feasts through the luwa. Gamo locates the actual staging of the luwa within the procession and the feast for the patron saints. The luwa as a dramatic form is identified by its key elements&mdash;the image of the patron and the luwante as characters, the <strong>kubol</strong> (overhead covering shelter) as the performance space, the people of the town of Taal as the audience, the luwa as text, and the feast for the patron saints as the context.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chapter 5, the last chapter, illustrates various ways in which the <strong>dalumat ng bayan</strong> (concept of town, community, or nation) is entwined with the luwa tradition. First, the <strong>hermano</strong> or <strong>hermana mayor</strong> (principal sponsor), in leading the community, mobilizes it toward the goal of a fruitful celebration.

Manila: National Bookstore Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anthology, originally published as the 19th volume of the Asian and Pacific Writing series of Queensland University Press, a series dedicated to making literature and contemporary writing from Asia and the Pacific available to a wider readership, is the second volume devoted to the works of Nick Joaquin, the first being <strong><em>Tropical Gothic: <strong>Selected <strong>Stories</strong></strong></em></strong>. <strong><em>Tropical Baroque</em></strong> is an anthology of four of Joaquin&rsquo;s most representative plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most famous of these, <strong><em><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/645\"><strong>A Portrait of the Artist as Filipino</strong></a>: An Elegy in Three Scenes</em></strong>, tackles the difficulties faced by Filipino artists during the years following the shift from Spanish rule to American colonization. Set in 1941, sisters Candida and Paula, of the once-affluent Marasigan family, struggle to make ends meet, but refuse to sell the painting that their father, the famous Lorenzo Marasigan, painted for them and gave them as their passport out of poverty. The painting continues to attract a number of unpleasant personalities to the Marasigan residence who view the portrait, play critic, or conspire to buy it. Tony Javier, a boarder who is taken in by the Marasigan family as an additional source of income, seduces Paula to convince her to sell the portrait. Realizing Tony&rsquo;s real intentions, Paula destroys the painting instead. This leads to the reconciliation of Candida, Paula, and their father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second play, <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/675\"><strong><em>Tatarin: A Witch&rsquo;s Sabbath in Three Acts</em></strong></a>, is a dramatization of one of Joaquin&rsquo;s short stories, <strong><em>The Summer Solstice</em></strong>. In the 1850s on St. John&rsquo;s Day, Do&ntilde;a Lupeng learns that her cook, Amada, took part in the Tatarin, a pagan fertility ritual for women. Scornful yet intrigued by Amada&rsquo;s belief in old rituals, Do&ntilde;a Lupeng goes to see the Tatarin at the plaza, defying her husband who thinks that women should be under men&rsquo;s control. Do&ntilde;a Lupeng takes part in the ceremony. Failing to take his wife away from the ceremony, Don Paeng and Do&ntilde;a Lupeng have a confrontation afterward back at their home, where Do&ntilde;a Lupeng manages to compel her husband to say he adores her, and to kiss her feet out of submission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/608\">Fathers and Sons</a>: A Melodrama in Three Reels</em></strong>, is also an adaptation of another short story by Nick Joaquin, <strong><em>Three Generations</em></strong>. The play centers on the wheelchair-bound Zacarias Monzon, an ill-natured old man living in a mansion along with his daughter, Nena, and his mistress, a prostitute named Bessie. He reminisces about his past, his glory days as the &ldquo;Carretela King.&rdquo; He is forced out of his reverie by a visit from his son, Celo, and his family. Celo resents his father because of his abusive behavior in the past. Celo also disapproves of Bessie and drives her out of the house. Outraged, Zacarias lashes out at Celo, only to find that he no longer has the strength to fight his son. Zacarias&rsquo;s illness worsens and Celo soon finds himself whipping his own son, Chitong, to release his anger at having to take care of the man who once abused him. But Chitong defies his father and brings Bessie back to the mansion, in time for Zacarias to die in her arms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>The Beatas: A Hymn in Three Stanzas</em></strong> narrates the events that lead to the formation of the Beaterio de Santa Catalina de Manila. The play begins with a masquerade hosted by Do&ntilde;a Antonia Ezguerra, a widow, where a mysterious man uncovers the true reason behind the masquerade&mdash;a guise to veil the intentions of different women to establish their own religious community. Eight years later, the&nbsp;<em>b</em><em>eaterio&nbsp;</em>(religious house) finally gets permission to operate under the leadership of Hermana Francisca del Espiritu Santo, on the property left behind by the deceased Hermana Antonia Ezguerra. The beaterio faces many difficulties brought about by the government and the church in the following years, and is dissolved by the Dominican authorities, with the archbishop ruling that women should always be governed by men. The community of the beaterio decide to go into exile. The&nbsp;<em>hermanas&nbsp;</em>shed their scapulars and live out their exile at the Santa Potenciana. Two years later, they are granted permission by the archbishop to return to their beaterio.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an important anthology of Joaquin&rsquo;s most significant plays. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Athena Angela Aquino</strong> </em></p>\r\n",

Set in 1941, sisters Candida and Paula, of the once-affluent Marasigan family, struggle to make ends meet, but refuse to sell the painting that their father, the famous Lorenzo Marasigan, painted for them and gave them as their passport out of poverty. The painting continues to attract a number of unpleasant personalities to the Marasigan residence who view the portrait, play critic, or conspire to buy it. Tony Javier, a boarder who is taken in by the Marasigan family as an additional source of income, seduces Paula to convince her to sell the portrait. Realizing Tony&#x2019;s real intentions, Paula destroys the painting instead. This leads to the reconciliation of Candida, Paula, and their father."

Baquiran Jr</a> notes that in publishing new and untested scripts, the Virgin Labfest anthologies reflect the direction of contemporary theater as defined by the minds of emergent writers. The plays portray the clash of traditional and nascent ideas as well as the way modern Filipinos negotiate their identity in society. The scripts cover a variety of narratives&mdash;the ill-fated romance between monsters and men, the coming-of-age rituals of children in the city and country, or speculative tales of superheroes juggling their obligation to save the world and the expectations of their families. While the stories are varied, experimental, and highly imaginative, many scripts revolve around common and uniquely Filipino themes, such as the importance of community and the push toward a more progressive nation. The scripts range from satire and absurd comedy to social realistic and representational drama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first anthology was launched alongside the opening of the fifth Virgin Labfest in 2009.

The plays portray the clash of traditional and nascent ideas as well as the way modern Filipinos negotiate their identity in society. The scripts cover a variety of narratives&#x2014;the ill-fated romance between monsters and men, the coming-of-age rituals of children in the city and country, or speculative tales of superheroes juggling their obligation to save the world and the expectations of their families. While the stories are varied, experimental, and highly imaginative, many scripts revolve around common and uniquely Filipino themes, such as the importance of community and the push toward a more progressive nation. The scripts range from satire and absurd comedy to social realistic and representational drama."

Tiongson begins his essay by clarifying the terms &ldquo;drama&rdquo; and &ldquo;Philippine.&rdquo; Departing from Western concepts, Tiongson foregrounds the concept of mimesis or &ldquo;the imitation by an actor of actions that happen in real life&rdquo; as the defining element of drama. The Philippine-ness of drama is determined by the following criteria: reflecting Filipino society, history, and culture; answering the need of the Filipino at a given time; and working for the good of many.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tiongson surveys various Philippine dramatic forms unique to their historical periods. The indigenous period nurtured rituals, dances, and customs held or performed on various occasions of a person&rsquo;s life cycle or for the celebration of tribal activities. The Spanish colonial period yielded various types of secular and religious dramas; among the former, the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>, also known as the <strong>moro-moro</strong> or <strong>linambay</strong>, was the most important and popular.

Tiongson singles out the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/475\"><strong>sinakulo</strong></a> as the most outstanding and enduring among the Philippine religious dramas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first two decades of the early American occupation witnessed the rise of the <strong>drama</strong> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a>. Of the dramas, two types are highlighted: the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/450\"><strong>drama simboliko</strong></a> or revolutionary dramas of 1902-6, also labelled &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; by the Americans, and the romantic dramas. The later American period produced the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/443\"><strong>bodabil</strong></a>, or stage show, and the so-called legitimate plays; the former began as intermission numbers and evolved into the stage show during the Japanese occupation, when the romantic drama was added to the bodabil as one of its highlights. Tiongson traces the introduction of &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo; theater in the Philippines through the Westernized educational system, and outlines several developments in this form: production by exclusive schools of Shakespearean and other Western classics in the original English or in English translation, staging of Broadway plays by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/3204\">Repertory Philippines</a>, mounting of Filipino translations of Western classics by <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3300\">Teatro Pilipino</a>, and production of adaptations of politically relevant foreign plays by PETA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the contemporary period, Tiongson underscores the rise of a Filipino consciousness as the most significant context that shaped Philippine theater and culture. Some of the characteristics and tendencies of theater during this time were the adoption of Western styles such as realism (both the psychological and the social) and expressionism; the experimentation with traditional Filipino dramatic forms such as the panunuluyan, <a href=\"http://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/452\"><strong>duplo</strong></a>, &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; drama, and the mass; and the exploration of Asian theater styles like the <strong>Noh</strong> and <strong>kyogen</strong>. In concluding the survey, Tiongson acknowledges that the plays of the contemporary period have succeeded in faithfully portraying Philippine reality through the use of local and foreign theater traditions; still, he also emphasizes the need for a committed theater&mdash;one that provides a more thorough scientific analysis of society, believes in the power of organized movements to instigate change, and reaffirms hope in the liberation of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each section of Tiongson&rsquo;s narrative ends in a systematic analysis of the theater forms of the period by applying the threefold criteria for Philippine-ness set forth at the beginning. As a result, he is able to provide an objective evaluation of a theater form. The revolutionary drama or &ldquo;seditious&rdquo; plays, for instance, are hailed as &ldquo;Philippine drama at its meaningful best,&rdquo; since they presented, albeit in allegorical form, all the principal economic forces at work in Philippine society during the early part of the American period; answered the urgent need of the majority of Filipinos to be aware of the implications of American presence and be impelled to act; and worked for the desire of the masses to liberate themselves from colonialism. In addition, each theater form or type discussed was clearly explained, with key features identified and illustrated through specific and authentic examples of plays or productions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This essay is a succinct yet comprehensive exposition of the development of Philippine theater using a clearly articulated set of criteria rooted in a Marxist perspective. It has proven to be a valuable resource for scholars who have studied and analyzed various theater and cultural forms otherwise ignored in the academe. The Filipino phrase &ldquo;repleksiyon ng pangangailangan ng nakararami&rdquo; (reflection of the needs of the majority), or &ldquo;RPN,&rdquo; a conflation of the essay&rsquo;s three criteria of Philippine-ness, became a catchphrase in the 1970s and 1980s for a number of activist and nationalist theater groups and artists, as they developed their aesthetics, and articulated their vision of what their theater should be. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Galileo S.

		"text": "<p>PhD diss. Author, Amparo Adelina C. Umali III. Graduate School of Letters, Department of Japanese Literature, Doshisha University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dissertation, written in the Japanese language, is a comparative study of three plays written by female playwrights (Filipino, American, and Japanese) who adapted the Japanese <strong>Noh</strong> theater form. It analyzes the feminist and intercultural elements of their new Noh plays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Umali&rsquo;s work includes the chapter &ldquo;<a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3037\">Amelia Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/58/633\"><strong><em>Ang Paglalakbay ni <strong><strong>Sisa</strong></strong>: Isang Noh sa Laguna</em></strong></a> &rdquo; (Sisa&rsquo;s Journey: A Noh in Laguna). Umali describes the theatrical elements and dramatic structure of the Noh that Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio incorporates in her play, discusses the importance of Filipino elements incorporated in this play, and analyzes the resulting adaptation of one story from a classic Filipino novel into theatrical performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Umali cites the following Noh elements both found and transformed in Lape&ntilde;a-Bonifacio&rsquo;s play: two main characters, chorus, live mini-orchestral music, empty stage, mask, costume, and lights. While Sisa and Padre Salvi are supporting characters in <a href=\"https://www.info-aid.net/dev-epa/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/9/77/1781\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Touch Me Not), they are made the <strong>shite</strong> (principal character) and the <strong>waki</strong> (traveling secondary character), respectively, thereby making their narratives the focus of the play. Additionally, the conscious use of Noh elements with a few changes can be found in the minimalist stage with the <strong>hashigakari</strong> bridgeway, the masks worn by the Sisa character, simple lighting, and the <strong>jo-ha-kyu</strong> dramatic structure divided into different <strong>shodan</strong> but without the Japanese poetic conventions. The incorporation of Filipino elements is most evident in costume, stage, and music through the wearing of native traditional clothing such as the&nbsp;<em>baro&rsquo;t saya&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>camisa de chino</em>, the replacement of the pine tree with the mango tree, and the use of the banduria and percussion sticks in lieu of the&nbsp;<em>shamisen&nbsp;</em>and other Japanese musical instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feminist and nationalist discourses inform Umali&rsquo;s reading of the play. In this chapter of her dissertation, she underscores three observations: first, the transformation of Sisa&rsquo;s character from the suffering mother archetype to an empowered woman who fights for justice; second, the possibility of looking at the characters of Padre Salvi and Sisa as symbols and binary opposites&mdash;the colonizer and the colonized, the oppressor and the oppressed&mdash;and as such, metaphors in narrating colonization, struggle, and liberation; third, the privileging of both Filipino and Asian aesthetics as counterdiscourse to the hegemony of Western artistic standards in the practice and study of Philippine theater.

While Sisa and Padre Salvi are supporting characters in <a href=\"/9/9/5652\">Jose Rizal</a>&#x2019;s <a href=\"/9/77/1781\"><strong><em><strong><strong><strong><strong>Noli Me Tangere</strong></strong></strong></strong></em></strong></a> (Touch Me Not), they are made the <strong>shite</strong> (principal character) and the <strong>waki</strong> (traveling secondary character), respectively, thereby making their narratives the focus of the play. Additionally, the conscious use of Noh elements with a few changes can be found in the minimalist stage with the <strong>hashigakari</strong> bridgeway, the masks worn by the Sisa character, simple lighting, and the <strong>jo-ha-kyu</strong> dramatic structure divided into different <strong>shodan</strong> but without the Japanese poetic conventions. The incorporation of Filipino elements is most evident in costume, stage, and music through the wearing of native traditional clothing such as the&#xA0;<em>baro&#x2019;t saya&#xA0;</em>and&#xA0;<em>camisa de chino</em>, the replacement of the pine tree with the mango tree, and the use of the banduria and percussion sticks in lieu of the&#xA0;<em>shamisen&#xA0;</em>and other Japanese musical instruments."

Rosal; translation into Filipino by Noemi M. Ulep. Quezon City: Ateneo de Manila University Press.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The introduction gives a historical-critical analysis of the major types of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/1/2/2348\">Iloko</a> folk drama: the <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/472\"><strong>sarsuwela</strong></a> and <a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/55/456\"><strong>komedya</strong></a>. For each type, there is a discussion of the dramatists and their production staff, sponsors, and patrons; the staging process of the plays; their popularity and decline; and the social role of these plays on the lives of Ilocanos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The book anthologizes four-selected Iloko sarsuwela by four major <strong>sarsuwelista</strong> representing inner Ilocandia, the original Ilocos provinces, and outer Ilocandia, the Ilocanized provinces and countries where Ilocanos have migrated. The texts were chosen based on their popularity; their subject matter, theme, and artistry in dramatic presentation; their influence on their contemporaries and succeeding dramatists; and the place of origin of their writers and location of performances. The book includes the musical score of <a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3138\">Barbaro Paat</a>&rsquo;s <strong><em>Nanangco!</em></strong> (Mother!).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the choice of dramatists, the author considered their contribution to the development of the genre, their popularity and length of theatrical involvement, the artistic qualities of their work, their influence on succeeding dramatists, and their place of origin and the places where their plays were presented.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/60/2856\">Mena Pecson Crisologo</a> of Vigan, Ilocos Sur, is popularly known as the &ldquo;Father of Iloko Zarzuela.&rdquo; <strong><em>Neneng</em></strong> stands out as Crisologo&rsquo;s best sarsuwela due to its well-constructed plot, as well as its use of historical and nationalistic themes. The story is set in a town in Central Luzon at the start of the 1896 Revolution. The young Neneng is almost raped by a Spanish parish priest but is rescued by Iloko revolutionaries who stab him to death 11 times and drag his body around the town. Neneng accepts the love of Valentin, one of the revolutionaries, and the play ends with all singing &ldquo;Viva Pilipinas! Viva America!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pascual Guerrero Agcaoili of Piddig, Ilocos Norte, embodies the sarsuwela tradition in Ilocos, especially the transition from the traditional to the modern style. He is the only Iloko sarsuwelista known to have written in verse. <strong><em>Daguiti Agpaspasucmon ti Basi</em></strong> (The Basi Vendors), his most popular work, is a satire on society using burlesque and comedy. In the play, rival basi vendors Bastiana and Alejo appear in court, each one complaining of the other&rsquo;s disorderliness and other bad habits, only to end up marrying each other. The play highlights social issues such as students&rsquo; aversion to manual/farm work, wives&rsquo; infidelity to migrant husbands working in Hawaii, a gradual dislike for traditional Iloko customs, and government officials&rsquo; negligence in performing their duties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dev-epa.info-aid.net/index.php/Sys_controllers/articlePage/7/7/3044\">Isaias R. Lazo</a> of San Vicente, Ilocos Sur, was a playwright and sarsuwela mentor for four decades. His most famous play, <strong><em>Siak ti <strong><strong>Anak</strong></strong>mo</em></strong> (I Am Your Daughter), is a satire against the evils of the American educational system, interspersed with the comic love story of male and female servants. It is also a dramatization of the Ilocanos&rsquo; pragmatism and respect for parents, as shown in the decision of Norma, the protagonist, to follow her parents&rsquo; will to marry Socing, a man she does not love but who turns out to be a good provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The works of Barbaro Paat of Bantay, Ilocos Sur, are not really &ldquo;artistic,&rdquo; but he is still considered the most popular and productive Ilocano sarsuwelista since 1933. He was mentor to younger Ilocano sarsuwelista and directors who were part of his troupe, traveling across Ilocos Sur and the Ilocanized provinces. <strong><em>Nanangco!</em></strong> was continually watched by huge crowds that did not tire of sentimental love stories. The play focuses on the relationship between Andoy and his wife, Adela, whose children Rustico and Erlinda are forced to separate due to their father&rsquo;s cruelty and the outbreak of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the characteristics of the Spanish zarzuela were imbibed in different ways in the regions, the sarsuwela in Iloko remained folk drama in its basic form, serving as an instrument for social integration and welfare as well as strengthening the cultural, social, and religious aspects of the lives of Ilocanos. It also served as an effective tool for social criticism, at the same time reinforcing traditional Ilocano values such as&nbsp;<em>gasat&nbsp;</em>(fatalism), love for education, strong family ties, love for adventure, and pragmatism. <span class=\"icon-epa-sun\">&nbsp;</span><em><strong>Written by Noemi U.
